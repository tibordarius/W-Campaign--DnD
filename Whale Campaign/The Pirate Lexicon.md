Careen

To heel over a ship to clean the seaweed and barnacles from her bottom.  

Careening was a necessary part of nautical life. For reasons, which will be explained, it was one of the most hazardous tasks facing a [pirate crew](https://pirates.hegewisch.net/capcrew.html).

As is well known, as [ships](https://pirates.hegewisch.net/ships.html) cruise the ocean, their bottoms quickly become covered with barnacles. These barnacles affected the ships speed and mobility. These two characteristics were highly respected among pirate captains, for they knew above everything else that if they were to be pursued in would be speed and mobility that would save them above any amount of firepower they might possess.

Barnacles posed another problem. If they were not removed, periodically, they would also cause irreparable damage to the hull by eating away the wood or weakening the seems between planks. This meant that if the ship were at sea, far from land, it could go down. The threat of barnacles was taken very seriously.

![Careen](https://pirates.hegewisch.net/careening.jpg)

Often ships are [dry docked](https://pirates.hegewisch.net/nautical_lexicon.html#drydock) after a long ocean voyage, in order that the hull can be scraped free of barnacles and repaired.

Pirate rarely had the opportunity to dry dock. When a ship could not be dry docked, sailors had to devise other ways to clean the bottom. It was practically impossible to clean the bottom of a ship while in the water. The best alternative was careening.

Careening involved finding a suitable shallow bay where the ship could safely be run aground, thus exposing as much of the hull above the water line as possible. Then the ship would be unloaded as much as possible. The crew would then need to careen or turn the ship over on one side using block and tackle, and manpower.

The crew would try to pull the ship over enough to expose the keel or bottom of the ship. Then they would commence scraping that side of the ship, free of any barnacles. Then any damaged planks would be replaced or repaired. Following this step, if possible the bottom of the ship would be covered with paint, pitch or some kind of proctectant.

Once the one side was done, the crew would careen the ship to the other side and repeat the process.

The task was labor intensive and time consuming. Pirates were sitting ducks while careening their ship. They were often not armed well enough to stand a major ground assault and with their ship run aground they could not take on another ship. An example of how dangerous careening could be see the entry on [Captain Lowther](https://pirates.hegewisch.net/whoslowther.html) in the Pirates Who's Who of the Caribbean.

Having the ship run aground for a long period of time was dangerous, so the pirates did several things to reduce their risks. First they would look for secluded cays that offered good protection and cover from the sea, basically hiding from prying eyes. Such a place was known as a careenage. Another strategy was to careen only one side of the ship at a time in order to cut the length of time on shore by half.

Of course pirates could also swap ships in order to avoid careening. However this was seldom done. Many pirates preferred sloops because of their agility and speed and would often become attached to their ship, usually not giving it up unless it was in need of repair.

Cross-staff

First used for navigation in 1514, the cross-staff is an instrument used for taking the altitude of the sun or a star to find lattitude. The cross-staff pre-dates the octant and the sextant.

While more difficult to use than a back-staff, they were still around in the 1700s because they were inexpensive and could be used at night whereas the back-staff was difficult and sometimes impossible to use at night.. It was difficult to use on moving ships, especially in bad weather.

Grog

British naval seamen received a portion of liquor every day. Many sources suggest that in 1740 Admiral Edward Vernon ordered the rum to be diluted with water. Vernon's nickname was Old Grogram, and the beverage was given the name grog in disdain for Vernon's command decision. With that said, the word was used in the Caribbean at least as early as 1718. However, it is uncertain of the "grog" before 1740 was rum mixed with water or some other island concoction. What is known is that after Vernon started the practice, Rum mixed with water (and usually lemon or lime juice) was called grog. Some sources suggest that Edward Vernon was actually nick-named "Old Grog" after he instituted the policy of mixing the sailors rum.Water and rum mixed together was often called Grog. A dram (a small amount) of rum was often added to a sailor's water ration. A proper grog often included lime juice to help to stave off scurvy and a measure of cane sugar to help kill the bitterness of the water.

The sailors rum ration was added to the water for a more important reason than just killing the taste of the water. The rum was added to water to prevent hoarding of the rum ration. By adding the rum to the water, the alcohol would be diluted and lessen the chance of the sailor becoming drunk.

In addition, the rum rations was given to sailors to help them keep their spine during battle. A little rum helped to steady the nerves of the gun crews.

Despite the rationing of rum, sailors would often find ways to have a stash of illegal alcohol aboard ship. It may have been smuggled liquors from a shore leave or made from an illegal still stashed somewhere on the ship. Alcohol always remained a problem aboard ship.

The simplest of recipes would be: Add approximately one ounce of fine rum (the rum used in the Royal Navy was an exceptional quality alcohol) to tin or glass of water (7 to 9 oz.)

A more complex recipe would be: 1 (oz) of Rum  
the juice of half a lime  
one or two teaspoons of cane sugar  
and fill the rest of your tin or mug with water.

When it was made onboard ship it was usually made in a large barrel called the grog tub and then rationed out to the sailors. Grog gets its name from Old Grogram, the nick name of British Rear Admiral Edward Vernon who order his sailors rum ration diluted to prevent hoarding and drunkenness.

Leeward and windward are words used to describe wind direction. Leeward is with the wind and Windward is against the wind. Still confused? Say you're standing outside on a windy day. The wind is blowing in your face. You are facing Windward. If you started walking in that same direction you would be walking windward. If the wind is blowing on your back then you are facing leeward. If you start walking in the same direction you are moving Leeward. This becomes important with tides.

Longboat

The largest boat belonging to a sailing vessel (other than a launch). A longboat is often used as a tender for a larger craft and used to transfer personnel between ships or ship to shore.

Pole Star

Polaris, the North Star. The most important star in the Northenr Hemisphere when it comes to navigation. It is located alomost directly above the North Pole all year around. While it is not a bright star it is easily found by using the Big Dipper or Ursa Major. The Big Dipper is found in the northern sky, but its postion changes with the seasons. Sometimes the Dipper will be upside down or on its side, and the closer you live to the equator, the lower in your sky it will appear. From most places in the Northern Hemisphere, the Big Dipper should be visible high in the sky from late winter through early summer. During these seasons, the Dipper will be on its side or upside down. If you live far enough north, you will see the Dipper through summer and fall, when the cup is upright. Once you locate the Big Dipper you can use the cup as a pointer to the pole star. The last two stars in the Big Dipper's cup point toward the pole star or Polaris. (Remeber to go up from the dipper) Away to verify that you have found the North Star is with the little Dipper. Polarism the north star, is the last star in the handle of the little Dipper or Ursa Minor. Ursa Minor looks similar to the Big Dipper. but also resembles a kite with a tail made of three stars.

In Naval terms, it was a way of conscription. People were pressed into service with the Royal Navy as well as other navies in time of need. Typically this meant finding a person who was somewhat inebriated, hitting them over the head and then having them wake up aboard ship and out to sea. This also led to the phrase **Press Gang** which was a group of sailors led by an officer or boatswain who would force people into naval service.

To add to the confusion: press or more correctly pressing was a form of [torture](https://pirates.hegewisch.net/punish.html) in which heavy weights were placed on a person's body in an effort to get them to confess to a crime. Sometimes the confession part was unnecessary. A person would be pressed as simple torture as means to pass the time until he was executed.

Prize

An enemy vessel captured at sea by a warship or privateer. Technically, these ships belonged to the crown, but after review by the Admiralty Court and condemnation, they were sold at auction and the prize money shared.

This was often a particular ship, that the crew would be seeking, for instance a Spanish [Galleon](https://pirates.hegewisch.net/pirateships.html) laden with gold from the Main.

It may also be a target of opportunity, if the crew was just trolling the coastal waters looking for anything that might come along. Or it could even be a sea port or inland town that the pirates had decided to raid.

Don't confuse it with such terms as plunder or booty. The pirate would plunder a prize and then divide the booty into lots among themselves. All in all such words are probably more common among the swashbucklers of the Silver Screen but they are part of the myth of piracy and were used in official documents..

A quarter can be a room, aboard a ship but more often in pirate terms quarter meant mercy. The pirate would run up the Jolly Roger which meant they were going to attack and show no mercy or quarter if fired upon. The captain of the other ship, could strike or lower their own flag meaning they were not going to fight. If the ship were to strike its colors then quarter was given and the ship was looted but personnel were not harmed (that is, if the pirate kept his word!).

Quarter deck

Quartemaster

Under pirates, the quartermaster had an almost equal amount of authority as the captain. If a ship was captured, the quartermaster almost always took over the captured ship. He maintained order, settled arguments, and distributed supplies. The quartermaster was in charge of all booty gained and distributed it among the crew.

Sloop of War

In the 18th and the earlier part of the 19th centuries, a sloop-of-war was a small sailing warship with a single gun deck that carried between ten and eighteen cannons. A brig sloop had two masts and a ship sloop had three (since a brig is a two masted square-rigged vessel and a ship a three- or more-masted square-rigger, though invariably of 3 only in that period). A ship sloop was generally the equivalent of a corvette (the French term for the same type, a name subsequently also applied to British vessels). A sloop-of-war was smaller than a sailing frigate and outside the rating system.

South Sea (Mar del Sur)

In general, the Southern Pacific Ocean. More specifically that area of the pacific ocean first discovered afte explorers crossed the Isthmus of Panama. At that time, it was not known this body of water stretched all the way to the Asia. Because it was reached after a southernly trek across the Isthmus its was named the South Sea. The Atlanitc ocean is often refered to as the North Sea.

Southern Cross

A constellation in the Southern Hemisphere that is used to aid navigation. The Pole Star or Polaris is not visible south of the Equator and there is not equivalent star in the Southern hemisphere marking the location of the South Pole. Thus, some other method is required to determine A true south direction. (Compass do not point to true north at all points of the Earth. They point to Magnetic North which can often be several degrees away from true north.)

The Southern Cross is used in place of the Polaris in the Southern Hemisphere. Five stars comprise the Southern Cross. Four of the stars mark the outward points of the cross and the fifth is slightly off from the center. Because the stars form a Latin Cross, early European mariners said it depicted the Crucifixion of Christ; with the fifth star representing where Christ’s side was pierced with the lance.

The further South you go the higher in the sky the Southern Cross becomes. The main beam of the cross points South when you follow a path from the head to the foot. Two pointer stars, off to the side of the Southern Cross (Alpha and Beat Centauri) are helpful aids in not only locating the Southern Cross but in determining the approximate location of the South Pole.

Split the difference between the two pointer stars and then draw an imaginary perpendicular line from these two stars. Follow this line to a spot where it crosses the other imaginary line that is follows the main beam of the Southern Cross. The South Pole is located under the spot where the lines bisect.

Spar

Spy-Glass

A handheld monocular telescope used to see objects at a distance. (like binoculars but just one tube). Spy-glasses were used by the captain and sometimes other trusted officers. While men were sent aloft to keep and eye out from other sails or land, they did not go aloft with the spy-glass. If the captain thought a distant object warranted a look through the spy-glass he would send a trusted officer or would go aloft himself and use the spy-glass. They were deemed to important for use by common sailors.![Spy-Glass](https://pirates.hegewisch.net/spyglass.jpg)

Weed, the (The Weed, The Indian Weed)

Tobacco, typically when referring to smoking tobacco, often used derisively. Smoking was common in the 17th and 18th century will all social classes partaking in the habit. Almost all tobacco was smoked in pipes, typically made of clay. Originally the pipes had small bowls and shirt stem but the Dutch enlarged the bowl and lengthened the stem.This new style clay pipe was quickly adopted by all European countries and became the most common pipe used during the Golden Age. This allowed for a large quantity of tobacco to smoked while at the same time cooling the smoke through the longer stem. The clay pipes were fragile and broke often. Most lower class smokers used a shorter stem pipe. Cigars were a late bloomer, being introduced first by Spain to other Europeans. Spain seems to have started making cigars as early as 1717 but the habit was not readily adopted in the American Colonies until as late as 1762. Widespread cigar smoking would not be common until the American civil war. Cigarettes would not reach Europe and the North America until 1855. Cigarettes reached Europe first via Turkey and then eventually made it to America.

Wench

The word wench literally means young woman or girl.  

From today's perspective (and for the most part, even in the 18th century) it was used despairingly. The word wench if often used to describe women who worked in taverns and/or brothels. For the most part modifiers were actually added to the word to specify the woman's profession. A female serving patrons of an establishment were serving wenches. At other times it was used to describe any kind of female of the rustic working class (laborers, the poor). When referring to prostitutes or mistresses the word wench would be modified with a noun such as common wench, light wench, wench of the stews, or wanton wench. The word whore was also commonly used to describe prostitutes.

Wench dates back to around 1290 when is word that simply meant a young girl or woman. At times it was used as a term of endearment used chiefly in addressing a daughter, wife, or sweetheart.(Far from today's idea of the word)

In most movies and works of literary fiction, the wench is pictured as often pretty, scantily dressed and enjoying her chosen profession. While some did fit this description most serving wenches worked long hours, many were widows or among the lowest class of working poor. Their harsh life usually led to poor health and a short life. Often a serving wench would have no choice but to also venture into prostitution in order to afford food and housing. The life of a prostitute is often glamorized in the movies in reality in often led longer work hours, unspeakable diseases, physical abuse, and an even shorter life.

![Serving Wench](https://pirates.hegewisch.net/New-wench2.gif)

18th Century Serving Wench. If she were selling more than ale, she could remove the scarf around her neck to show here "wares" and use her apron from a pillow.

In some case, wanton wenches (prostitutes) were forced into the profession. Female African slaves and in some cases white women were forced into the trade. While "white slavery" or forced prostitution was less common that forced African slavery did occur. Despite the portrayal of prostitution in such movies and **[Pirates of the Caribbean](https://pirates.hegewisch.net/)** and older movies such as **The Black Swan**, the life of a tavern wench or prostitute in the 18th century was a miserable intolerable affair.

Wind’s Eye

The direction from whcih the wind blows from. If you are facing the wind you are looking into the wind's eye.

Windward and Leeward: Leeward and windward are words used to describe wind direction. Leeward is with the wind and Windward is against the wind. Still confused? Say you're standing outside on a windy day. The wind is blowing in your face. You are facing Windward. If you started walking in that same direction you would be walking windward. If the wind is blowing on your back then you are facing leeward. If you start walking in the same direction you are moving Leeward. This becomes important with tides. A lee tide is when the wind and the tide are both going the same direction. A windward tide is when the tide and the wind are moving in opposite directions.  
Windward: Facing the direction of the wind. Moving AGAINST the Wind.
