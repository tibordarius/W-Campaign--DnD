## **Types of Travel Encounters**

### **Naval Skirmishes**

Not all waters are safe, and some factions actively seek to control the seas.

- **Abyssal Cult Raiders**: The cult has dispatched warships to intercept those meddling with their plans. Their vessels are reinforced with dark magic, and their crews are zealots willing to sacrifice everything.
- **Pirate Blockades**: A notorious pirate fleet demands tribute to allow safe passage. Players must either negotiate, fight their way through, or trick the pirates into letting them pass.
- **The Ghost Ship**: A derelict vessel drifts through the fog. Signs of battle mark its hull, and no living soul remains aboard—or so it seems.

### **Natural Hazards and Mystical Phenomena**

The sea is an unpredictable and dangerous place, filled with supernatural forces.

- **The Leviathan’s Maw**: A monstrous whirlpool threatens to pull the ship into the depths. A rumored path exists through it, but only if the party can interpret the clues left by old sailors.
- **The Everstorm**: A perpetual storm rages in an area marked on their charts. Is it a natural phenomenon, or is something fueling it?
- **A Bioluminescent Migration**: A breathtaking display of glowing marine life illuminates the waters. Hidden among the spectacle, however, are predatory creatures that lure the curious in with their radiant display.

### **Merchant and Smuggler Encounters**

Not all who sail are enemies—some seek to trade, profit, or deceive.

- **The Black Market Fleet**: A convoy of smugglers offers illicit goods and information. The right deal could reveal hidden locations or much-needed supplies.
- **The Cursed Cargo**: A desperate merchant hails the party, begging them to take on a shipment they were tricked into carrying. Accepting it could lead to riches—or a dangerous curse.
- **A Disguised Rival**: A merchant captain offers supplies, but keen eyes may recognize them as an enemy in disguise, attempting to poison or sabotage the ship.

### **Mysterious and Supernatural Events**

The ocean holds ancient secrets, some best left undisturbed.

- **The Singing Depths**: A haunting melody resonates from beneath the waves. Following it could lead to an ancient ruin—or a trap set by deep-sea sirens.
- **A Drifting Beacon**: A floating lantern, eerily untouched by the wind and waves, marks something important. Its presence invites investigation but also draws unwanted attention.
- **The Spirits of the Deep**: The players witness a ghostly reenactment of an ancient naval battle. Intervening or deciphering the scene could reveal hidden knowledge.

### **Espionage and Intrigue at Sea**

Not all threats come from outside the ship—some lurk within.

- **A Stowaway on Board**: A mysterious passenger is discovered in the ship’s hold. Are they an escaped prisoner, a desperate refugee, or a saboteur?
- **A Spy Among the Crew**: One of the crew members is relaying information to an enemy faction. Players must uncover their identity before they strike.
- **A Coded Message**: A floating bottle carries a letter with cryptic warnings or an urgent plea for aid. Deciphering it may set the party on a dangerous but rewarding path.
