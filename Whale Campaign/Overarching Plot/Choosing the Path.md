# **Choosing the Path**

## **Introduction**

The treasure hunt is not a straight course across the seas—it is a web of decisions, alliances, and betrayals. The players must decide how they will secure the relics and navigate the treacherous waters of power, diplomacy, and conflict. Each approach they take will shape the relationships they forge and the enemies they make.

## **Approaching the Hunt**

### **The Path of Cunning – Stealth & Espionage**

For those who prefer subtlety over brute force, stealth and deception provide an effective means to obtain the relics.

Some factions may be persuaded to willingly part with their relics if the right leverage is applied.

- **Offering Services to the Whale Society**: Proving one's worth to gain their trust and knowledge.

### **The Path of Might – Combat & Conquest**
