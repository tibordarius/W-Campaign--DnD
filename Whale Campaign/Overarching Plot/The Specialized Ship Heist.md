# **The Specialized Ship Heist**

## **Introduction**

The treasure map’s final location is beyond normal reach, hidden in a region of the sea where conventional ships cannot venture. Legends tell of a lost civilization that once guarded the site, its ruins now scattered across the ocean floor, protected by powerful magical wards and sea-born monstrosities. Unnatural storms, treacherous reefs, and mysterious magical disturbances guard the path, rendering most vessels useless. To reach this legendary destination, the players must secure a specialized ship—one capable of withstanding these extreme conditions and navigating the uncharted waters beyond the known world.

This heist is no simple task. The ship they seek is a prize that many factions desire, and obtaining it will require cunning, alliances, and perhaps a bit of treachery. The players must navigate a world of intrigue, where every faction has a vested interest in who ultimately wields this mighty vessel. Will they steal it from under the nose of a powerful navy, win it through a high-stakes challenge, or barter with influential figures to secure it?

## **Types of Specialized Ships**

### **[[The Leviathan’s Wake]] (Submarine)**

- A deep-diving vessel constructed by dwarven engineers and enchanted by sea elf sorcerers.
- Hidden in the depths of a **Sunken Vault**, guarded by ancient water elementals and lost technologies of an underwater empire.
- Ideal for navigating trenches, avoiding surface patrols, and uncovering deep-sea mysteries. It may also have secrets of its own, whispering echoes of its creators’ past.

### **[[The Skyfury]] (Airship)**

- A flying galleon built with a fusion of arcane propulsion and elemental air magic, originally crafted by the high arcanists of Halruaa and later seized by the Royal Navy for its strategic value.
- Currently docked in **Neverwinter**, held in a Royal Navy facility under the command of a ruthless admiral who suspects treachery at every turn.
- Perfect for bypassing naval blockades and reaching floating islands or skybound fortresses, though its stolen nature may make it a constant target.

### **[[The Starborn Voyager]] (Spelljammer)**

- An astral ship capable of navigating between dimensions and bypassing even the most arcane defenses.
- Hidden in an abandoned **Astral Shipyard**, accessible only through a forgotten planar rift guarded by sentient starbeasts and rogue navigators.
- Grants unparalleled maneuverability and the ability to evade even the most persistent pursuers, but requires a captain attuned to the cosmos to pilot it effectively.

## **Approaches to Securing the Ship**

### **1. The Grand Theft Heist**

- The players infiltrate the ship’s guarded location, disable its defenses, and steal it outright.
- Requires careful planning, stealth, and possibly a diversion to escape unnoticed.
- Potential encounters include:
    - Breaking into the Royal Navy’s secure shipyard and impersonating officials.
    - Disabling arcane locks or mechanical traps securing the vessel, some of which may be sentient and resistant to tampering.
    - A high-speed escape under enemy fire, leading to an exhilarating chase sequence.

### **2. The High-Stakes Gamble**

- A powerful faction (pirates, nobles, or an arcane syndicate) owns the ship and offers it as a reward in a high-stakes challenge.
- The players must win a daring contest, such as—though failure may result in alternative opportunities to obtain the ship, or force the players to resort to theft or diplomacy instead:
    - A legendary card game in the floating casinos of **Calimport**, where the stakes are rigged and the dealers may not be human.
    - A high-speed sea race through treacherous waters, where sabotage is not just allowed but expected.
    - A dueling tournament where the winner claims the vessel, but each challenger must bring something of equal worth as an ante.

### **3. The Diplomatic Acquisition**

- Some factions may be willing to trade or loan the ship in exchange for a significant favor. However, failure to negotiate successfully may lead to drastic consequences—an insulted Pirate Lord could declare a vendetta, the Royal Navy might blacklist the players from key ports, or the Order of Oceanic Scholars could place a bounty on them for attempting to steal their secrets.
- Requires negotiation, completing faction-based quests, and possibly betraying an ally.
- Potential deals include:
    - Convincing the **Order of Oceanic Scholars** to part with their experimental vessel by retrieving forbidden knowledge lost to time.
    - Trading valuable relics with an influential **Pirate Lord**, who may demand future services in return.
    - Serving the **Whale Society** in a dangerous mission in exchange for their ship’s location, ensuring their trust isn’t misplaced.

## **Competing Factions**

### **The Abyssal Cult**

- Seeking the ship to transport eldritch horrors to the treasure’s final resting place.
- Will stop at nothing to secure it first, sending spies and saboteurs to disrupt other factions’ attempts.

### **The Royal Navy**

- Believes the ship is too dangerous to be controlled by private hands and must remain under their command.
- Will hunt the players down if they attempt to steal or misuse it, deploying their finest captains to reclaim it.

### **The Pirate Alliance**

- Desires the ship as the ultimate weapon to dominate the seas.
- May ally with or betray the players depending on their approach, particularly if they already hold power in pirate society.

### **The Order of Oceanic Scholars**

- Built one of the specialized ships as part of an experiment.
- Will trade access in return for knowledge or artifacts related to the treasure’s final location, but may demand proof of the players' intent.

## **Side Quests & Additional Challenges**

- **Recovering a Missing Engineer:** The key to operating the vessel is a missing engineer who vanished under mysterious circumstances, possibly abducted by rival factions.
- **Securing the Fuel Source:** Whether elemental crystals, eldritch essence, or a long-lost magical artifact, the ship needs a rare power source, requiring dangerous retrieval missions.
- **Sabotaging a Rival’s Attempt:** Another group is attempting to take control of the ship—players must disrupt their plans first or face them as future adversaries.
- **Ancient Guardian’s Challenge:** Some ships require an ancient trial to prove one’s worth, demanding both wit and strength to claim them as their own.
