**Tags**: #GarlanIronkeel #Quest #Shipwright #Waterdeep #ShipAcquisition #CampaignQuest

## Overview

This document details the quest given by **[[Garlan Ironkeel]]**, a master shipwright in Waterdeep. Garlan offers the players a deal: if they can complete a dangerous task for him, he will reward them with a ship or a significant discount on one. This quest involves retrieving valuable tools or supplies that were stolen from him by a gang in the Dock Ward. The players must navigate the seedy underbelly of Waterdeep, confront the thieves, and recover Garlan’s property.

---

**Narrator**:

> "Garlan Ironkeel stands with his arms crossed, a scowl on his face as he watches you approach. ‘I hear you’re looking for a ship,’ he says, his voice gruff. ‘Well, I’ve got one that might suit you, but there’s a catch.

    - **Skill Check**: **Wisdom (Insight) (DC 12)** or **Charisma (Persuasion) (DC 12)** to gather information.

---

### **Part 2: Infiltrating the Warehouse**

Once the players have the location of the thieves’ hideout, they must infiltrate the warehouse to recover the stolen tools. The warehouse is heavily guarded by Griffin’s gang, and the players can choose to either sneak in or confront the thieves directly.

#### **Warehouse Layout**:

- **Main Entrance**: Heavily guarded by two thugs at the door.
    
    - **Skill Check**: **Stealth (DC 14)** to sneak past the guards, or **Charisma (Deception) (DC 15)** to bluff their way in.

    - **Skill Check**: **Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) (DC 13)** to disarm the trap, or **Dexterity (Acrobatics) (DC 14)** to avoid triggering it.

    - **Skill Check**: **Intelligence (Investigation) (DC 14)** to search the crates and find Garlan’s tools.

#### **Possible Encounters**:

1. **Thug Guards**: Griffin’s gang employs a number of thugs to guard their warehouse.
    - **Thug Stats**: AC 12, HP 30, armed with clubs and short swords.

    - **Griffin’s Stats**: AC 14, HP 60, armed with a scimitar and throwing daggers.
    - **Special Tactics**: Griffin will attempt to escape if the fight turns against him, using hidden passages within the warehouse.

---

Once the players have dealt with the guards and possibly **Griffin Stonejaw**, they can recover Garlan’s stolen tools. The tools are high-quality shipwright instruments, essential for Garlan’s work.

**Narrator**:

> "You pry open a heavy crate and find a set of finely crafted tools—saws, chisels, and hammers, all gleaming despite the dust and grime of the warehouse. These must be the tools Garlan spoke of. With the job done, it’s time to head back and collect your reward."

---

### **Part 4: Returning to Garlan**

The players return to Garlan Ironkeel’s shipyard with the stolen tools. Garlan is impressed by their success and offers them a choice of reward: a ship or a significant discount on purchasing one from his yard.

**Narrator**:

> "Garlan Ironkeel inspects the tools with a satisfied grunt. ‘Good work,’ he says, nodding in approval. ‘I wasn’t sure you’d be up to the task, but you’ve proven yourselves. As promised, you’ll have your ship—or a fair deal on one, if you’d rather. Either way, you’ve earned it.’"

---

### **Rewards**

The players receive the following rewards for completing the quest:

- **Ship**: Garlan provides the players with a small ship (such as a sloop or merchant cog) to use for their sea journey. The exact type of ship depends on the players' needs and preferences.
    
    - **Ship Stats** (Example for a Sloop):
        - **Armor Class**: 13
        - **Hit Points**: 150
        - **Speed**: 40 ft
        - **Crew Size**: 5-10
- **Discount on a Larger Ship**: Alternatively, the players can choose a discount on a larger ship from Garlan’s inventory.
    
    - **Example**: 50% off a merchant cog or war galley, reducing the cost significantly.
- **Gold Reward**: If the players prefer gold, Garlan can offer them a financial reward instead of a ship (1,000-1,500 gp).
    

---

### **Consequences**

The players’ actions during the quest may have long-term consequences:

- **Positive Relationship with Garlan**: Successfully completing the quest establishes a strong relationship with Garlan, who may offer future discounts or ship upgrades.
- **Griffin’s Revenge**: If **Griffin Stonejaw** survives the encounter, he may seek revenge on the players later in the campaign, attacking them at sea or sabotaging their future efforts in the Dock Ward.

---

### **Foreshadowing Future Quests**

This quest can tie into larger campaign arcs, providing clues about the pirate network, smuggling operations, or even connections to [[Leviathan’s Lore]].

**Narrator**:

> "As you leave the Dock Ward, the streets grow quiet, but you can’t shake the feeling that you’re being watched. Griffin Stonejaw may be gone for now, but there are whispers of a larger smuggling ring operating in the shadows. Perhaps your actions have set something bigger in motion."

---

## Compressed Connections

1. **[[Garlan Ironkeel]]**: The players’ relationship with Garlan will play a key role in their future dealings, particularly with regard to ship upgrades and repairs.
2. **[[Pirate Network]]**: This quest hints at a broader pirate or smuggling network that could become a recurring threat or opportunity for the players as they delve deeper into the campaign.
3. **[[Leviathan’s Lore]]**: While this quest focuses on local theft, it could foreshadow deeper connections to the disrupted ocean currents and the forces behind [[Leviathan’s Lore]].

### Purchasing a Ship from Captain Jack Sparrow


**Purchasing a Ship from Captain Jack Sparrow**

**Tags**: #ShipAcquisition #CaptainJackSparrow #PirateDeal #Waterdeep #SeaTravel

## Overview

In this scenario, the players have an opportunity to purchase a ship from the infamous pirate **[[Captain Jack Sparrow]]**. Known for his cunning, charm, and knack for getting into (and out of) trouble, Jack offers the players a chance to acquire a unique vessel, but his deals always come with complications. The ship he offers may be well worth the price—if the players can navigate the challenges that come with dealing with Jack Sparrow.

---

### **Meeting Captain Jack Sparrow**

The players are introduced to **[[Captain Jack Sparrow]]** through a contact or by sheer luck. Jack is a pirate of some renown, known for his unpredictable behavior and love of adventure. He offers to sell the players one of his prized ships, but the deal may come with certain strings attached.

**Narrator**:

> "You find yourselves in a dimly lit tavern near Waterdeep’s docks, when a familiar figure swaggering through the door catches your eye. **Captain Jack Sparrow**, dressed in his usual eccentric attire, makes his way to your table with a mischievous grin. ‘I hear you’re in need of a ship,’ he says, plopping down in the chair opposite you. ‘As it happens, I have a fine vessel up for grabs—though, of course, nothing comes for free.’"

---

### **The Ship: The Black Tide**

Jack offers the players a unique ship, **The Black Tide**, a sleek, fast vessel ideal for long voyages and quick getaways. The ship is in good condition, but it comes with a mysterious past—rumors of its involvement in smuggling, pirate battles, and supernatural occurrences are rampant.

#### **The Black Tide: Ship Stats**:

- **Type**: Brigantine
- **Armor Class**: 15
- **Hit Points**: 350
- **Speed**: 40 ft
- **Crew Size**: 20-30
- **Special Features**: The ship is enchanted with a minor illusion spell that allows it to blend into fog or low visibility conditions, making it harder for enemies to spot during chases.

#### **Cost of the Ship**:

- **Price**: 8,000 gp (with some negotiation possible).
- **Alternative Payment Options**: Jack offers to lower the price if the players agree to complete a favor for him, such as retrieving a lost treasure, delivering a secret cargo, or helping him escape from a dangerous situation.

---

### **Negotiating with Jack Sparrow**

Dealing with Jack is never straightforward. Players must carefully navigate the negotiation process, as Jack is known for his silver tongue and ability to twist deals in his favor. However, with the right approach, they may be able to secure a favorable price or even some bonuses.

#### **Skill Checks for Negotiation**:

- **Charisma (Persuasion) (DC 15)**: To negotiate a lower price for the ship or secure additional terms in the players' favor.
- **Charisma (Deception) (DC 16)**: To bluff or mislead Jack into believing the players have more leverage than they do.
- **Insight (DC 14)**: To sense if Jack is hiding something about the ship or the terms of the deal.

**Narrator**:

> "Jack leans back in his chair, his grin widening as you lay out your terms. ‘I’ll tell you what,’ he says, tapping his chin. ‘You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours. Let’s just say, there’s a bit of unfinished business I need to take care of, and with a crew like yours, we might be able to help each other out.’"

---

### **Possible Complications**

Dealing with **[[Captain Jack Sparrow]]** is never without risk. The players might find themselves entangled in some of Jack’s misadventures, or they may discover that the ship comes with a few hidden problems.

#### **Complication 1: Stolen Ship?**

- After acquiring **The Black Tide**, the players may learn that the ship was previously stolen by Jack from another pirate lord or a powerful merchant. This could lead to future confrontations with those who want the ship back.
    - **Skill Check**: **Charisma (Persuasion)** or **Deception** to talk their way out of the situation, or **Combat** if the enemies demand the ship's return.

#### **Complication 2: Haunted by Its Past**

- The ship has a supernatural history, possibly tied to ghostly pirates or cursed treasures. The players may experience strange occurrences while sailing, such as spectral visions, sudden changes in weather, or mysterious disappearances of crew members.
    - **Skill Check**: **Arcana (DC 15)** or **Religion (DC 14)** to understand the supernatural forces at play and find a way to lift any lingering curses.

#### **Complication 3: Jack’s Favor**

- If the players accepted Jack’s offer to lower the price in exchange for a favor, they may soon find themselves roped into one of his wild schemes. This could involve a dangerous treasure hunt, smuggling illegal goods, or helping Jack escape from a powerful enemy.
    - **Skill Check**: The players must navigate through various challenges, such as **Persuasion, Stealth, Combat**, or **Sleight of Hand**, depending on the nature of the favor.

---

### **The Favor: Jack's Scheme**

If the players accept a favor to lower the price of the ship, Jack asks them to assist him in recovering a hidden treasure or completing a risky task. The nature of the task depends on the campaign, but here are a few examples:

#### **Option 1: Treasure Hunt**

- Jack needs help retrieving a legendary pirate treasure hidden on a distant island. The island is rumored to be cursed, and the players will need to solve puzzles, face dangerous creatures, and outwit other treasure hunters.
    - **Challenges**:
        - **Combat**: Pirates or monsters guarding the treasure.
        - **Puzzles**: Riddles or traps that protect the treasure.
        - **Skill Checks**: **Investigation, Arcana, or Survival** to navigate the island and retrieve the treasure.

#### **Option 2: Smuggling Mission**

- Jack asks the players to smuggle a valuable but illegal cargo to a secret destination without being caught by the authorities or rival pirates. This mission involves stealth and evasion.
    - **Challenges**:
        - **Stealth and Evasion**: Players must avoid detection by authorities or rival smugglers.
        - **Skill Checks**: **Stealth, Deception, and Persuasion** to outwit patrols and rivals.

#### **Option 3: Escape from Pursuit**

- Jack is being hunted by a powerful enemy (a pirate lord, a navy officer, or a merchant prince), and he needs the players’ help to escape. The players must help him evade capture, possibly involving a daring sea chase or a showdown with the enemy.
    - **Challenges**:
        - **Naval Combat**: Players may need to fight off pursuers or outmaneuver them in a sea chase.
        - **Skill Checks**: **Survival, Navigation, and Combat** to navigate through treacherous waters and defeat or escape the enemy.

---

### **Rewards**

If the players successfully negotiate with **[[Captain Jack Sparrow]]** and complete the favor, they are rewarded with a powerful ship and potentially other bonuses, depending on the outcome of the favor.

#### **Possible Rewards**:

- **The Black Tide**: A brigantine with unique features, including speed, stealth, and minor magical properties.
- **Bonus Loot**: If they complete the favor, the players may also gain additional treasures, such as gold, jewels, or magical items.
- **Favor from Jack**: If the players help Jack successfully, they may gain his favor, meaning Jack could assist them in future endeavors or offer special deals on rare goods.

**Narrator**:

> "As you stand on the deck of **The Black Tide**, watching the horizon, a sense of accomplishment washes over you. The ship is fast, sleek, and powerful—just as Jack promised. But somewhere in the back of your mind, you can’t help but wonder if Jack’s favor will come back to haunt you."

---

### **Consequences of Dealing with Jack**

While acquiring **The Black Tide** is a great victory, dealing with **[[Captain Jack Sparrow]]** always carries the risk of future complications. The players may find themselves involved in further pirate escapades, pursued by enemies of Jack, or even tangled in supernatural events tied to the ship’s history.

#### **Future Encounters with Jack**:

- **Unexpected Visits**: Jack may reappear at any time, pulling the players into his latest scheme or asking for another favor.
- **Enemies Seeking Revenge**: If the players acquired a ship with a controversial past, they may face challenges from enemies who want to reclaim it.

---

## Compressed Connections

1. **[[Captain Jack Sparrow]]**: The players’ relationship with Jack Sparrow may continue to evolve throughout the campaign, leading to more adventures, favors, or potential conflicts.
2. **[[Pirate Networks]]**: By purchasing a ship from Jack, the players may gain insight into the pirate networks operating in the region, which could open up new quests or conflicts.
3. **[[The Black Tide]]**: The ship itself may become a key asset for the players, but it could also bring unforeseen consequences, especially if its past catches up with them.

### Purchasing a Ship

**Purchasing a Ship**

**Tags**: #ShipAcquisition #Waterdeep #SeaTravel #Shipwrights #CampaignAssets #SeaSerpent

## Overview

This document outlines the options and considerations for purchasing a ship. The players, having decided to acquire a ship for their sea voyage, can explore various avenues for making this purchase, including negotiations with shipwrights, taking loans, or other creative means. Acquiring a ship is a critical step in preparing for the long journey toward uncovering [[Leviathan’s Lore]] and facing the dangers of the seas.

---

### **Options for Purchasing a Ship**

1. **Purchasing a Ship from a Shipwright**:
    - The most straightforward option for the players is to buy a ship from one of the shipwrights or dealers in [[Waterdeep]]’s [[Shipwright’s Quarter]].
    - **Key NPCs**:
        - **[[Captain Harros Saltspire]]**: A veteran shipwright offering several ship types at reasonable prices.
        - **[[Marina Delwyn]]**: A charismatic dealer who specializes in sleek vessels for wealthy buyers.

---

#### **Ships Available for Purchase**

|Ship Type|Cost|Armor Class|Hit Points|Speed|Crew Size|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Small Sloop|2,000 gp|AC 13|150|40 ft|5-10|
|Merchant Cog|5,000 gp|AC 15|300|30 ft|10-20|
|War Galley|10,000 gp|AC 17|500|25 ft|30-50|
|Luxury Yacht|8,000 gp|AC 14|250|35 ft|15-25|
|Brigantine|7,000 gp|AC 16|350|30 ft|20-30|
|Clipper|12,000 gp|AC 15|400|45 ft|25-40|
|Fishing Boat|1,000 gp|AC 12|100|35 ft|3-6|

---

### **Key Considerations**

When purchasing a ship, players must take into account several factors:

1. **Cost**:
    
    - Ships range in price from 1,000 gp for a simple fishing boat to 12,000 gp for a high-speed clipper. Players must have enough gold on hand or be prepared to take on debt.
2. **Crew Size**:
    
    - Each ship has a required minimum crew size to function efficiently. Larger ships may require up to 50 crew members, while smaller vessels need fewer.
3. **Armor Class and Hit Points**:
    
    - The durability of the ship varies based on the type. Warships like the War Galley offer higher defenses and more hit points, while faster ships like the Clipper trade durability for speed.
4. **Speed**:
    
    - Faster ships, such as the Clipper, are ideal for outrunning pirate vessels or covering large distances quickly. Slower ships, like the Merchant Cog, may offer more cargo space but can be more vulnerable to attacks.

---

### **Negotiation and Discounts**

- Players can attempt to negotiate better prices or additional perks when purchasing a ship.
- **Skill Checks**:
    - **Persuasion (DC 10-15)**: To secure a discount or negotiate a favorable deal.
    - **Insight (DC 14)**: To assess if the shipwright is hiding any faults with the ship.
    - **Investigation (DC 12)**: To thoroughly inspect the ship and ensure it meets expectations.

---

### **Taking a Loan to Acquire a Ship**

Players who don’t have enough gold to purchase a ship outright may consider taking out a loan. Loans can be obtained from noble families, merchant companies, or loansharks. Each option has its risks and potential consequences, which may come back to haunt the players later in the campaign.

#### **Loan Options**:

1. **Noble Families**:
    
    - Wealthy noble families may offer loans in exchange for future favors or political alliances.
    - **Terms**: Low interest rates but require loyalty or service to the family.
2. **Merchant Companies**:
    
    - Merchant companies may provide loans with the expectation that the players will transport goods on their behalf during the voyage.
    - **Terms**: Medium interest rates but require shipping cargo as part of the repayment plan.
3. **Loansharks**:
    
    - Loansharks may offer fast loans with no collateral but impose high interest rates and brutal enforcement of repayment.
    - **Terms**: High interest rates and potential violent repercussions if repayment is delayed.

---

### **Quest-Related Ship Acquisition**

Another option is to acquire a ship through completing a quest. Some NPCs, like [[Garlan Ironkeel]], offer ships in exchange for completing difficult or dangerous tasks.

- **Garlan Ironkeel’s Quest**: Garlan offers a ship if the players retrieve his stolen tools from a gang of thieves in the Dock Ward.
    - **Quest Difficulty**: Moderate, with stealth and combat challenges.
    - **Reward**: Players earn a sturdy vessel at no cost, but must risk their lives to complete the mission.

---

### **Seizing a Pirate Vessel**

For players looking for a more daring route, they may choose to seize a pirate vessel instead of purchasing a ship. This involves tracking down a pirate hideout, launching a surprise attack, and claiming the ship for their own.

- **Pirate Hideout**: A remote hideout near Waterdeep harbors a pirate vessel ripe for the taking.
    - **Skill Challenges**:
        - **Stealth (DC 14)**: To approach the hideout unnoticed.
        - **Combat**: A battle with the pirate crew to seize control of the ship.
    - **Risk**: Potential retaliation from the pirate network or damage to the ship during the fight.

---

### **After Acquiring the Ship**

Once the players have successfully acquired a ship, they must:

- Hire a crew or recruit sailors for the voyage.
- Stock the ship with supplies, including food, water, weapons, and trade goods.
- Perform any repairs or upgrades to ensure the ship is seaworthy.

**Narrator**:

> "With your new ship secured, you stand at the helm, gazing out over the azure waters. The crew begins to load supplies, and the sails billow in the wind. Your journey is about to begin, but the dangers that await on the high seas are far greater than you imagined."

### Taking a Loan to Acquire a Ship


**Taking a Loan to Acquire a Ship**

**Tags**: #ShipAcquisition #Loans #NobleFamilies #MerchantCompanies #Loansharks #Waterdeep

## Overview

When the players do not have enough gold to outright purchase a ship, taking a loan becomes a viable option. Several entities in [[Waterdeep]] offer loans, each with its own terms, risks, and potential consequences. The choice of lender can shape the players' future interactions and affect the course of the campaign.

---

### **Types of Loans**

There are three main sources of loans available to the players: noble families, merchant companies, and loansharks. Each offers different terms and repayment conditions, which must be carefully considered before entering into an agreement.

---

### **Noble Family Loans**

Some of Waterdeep’s noble families are willing to offer loans to adventurers, particularly if the players have the potential to increase the family’s influence or provide valuable services.

#### **Key NPCs**:

- **[[Lord Edric Whitemane]]**: A high-ranking noble known for his interest in oceanic ventures and trade.
- **[[Lady Evelina Orwen]]**: A member of a wealthy family who is looking to extend their influence over trade routes.

#### **Loan Terms**:

- **Interest Rate**: Low (5%)
- **Collateral**: Often not required, but players must offer their loyalty and services to the family in exchange for the loan.
- **Repayment Period**: Longer-term repayment, with flexibility based on the players’ actions.
- **Consequences**: Failure to repay the loan or refusal to serve the family’s interests could lead to political repercussions, such as being blacklisted by other noble houses or facing the family’s enforcers.

---

### **Merchant Company Loans**

Merchant companies in Waterdeep are always seeking ways to expand their reach. Offering loans to adventurers is a way for these companies to invest in new trade routes and potentially profit from the players’ success.

#### **Key NPCs**:

- **[[Baldor Blackwell]]**: A prominent merchant with investments across multiple regions. He offers loans in exchange for shipping cargo on behalf of his company.
- **[[Faye Deremont]]**: An influential merchant looking to establish trade routes with distant lands, offering loans with the expectation that players will serve as her company’s agents.

#### **Loan Terms**:

- **Interest Rate**: Medium (10%)
- **Collateral**: Typically requires collateral in the form of future profits or agreeing to transport goods for the company.
- **Repayment Period**: Players must make regular payments during the voyage by transporting goods for the company or delivering on specific promises.
- **Consequences**: Failing to meet the company’s expectations could result in loss of reputation, repossession of the ship, or being barred from trading in key ports controlled by the company.

---

### **Loanshark Loans**

For those who need money quickly and with no questions asked, loansharks in the Dock Ward offer fast loans, but with steep interest rates and dangerous enforcement methods.

#### **Key NPCs**:

- **[[Garvin “The Blade” Thorne]]**: A notorious loanshark known for his ruthless tactics. He provides loans with little documentation but demands full repayment, plus interest, or his enforcers will collect in violent ways.
- **[[Kiera “Ironfist” Dorn]]**: A fearsome loanshark who specializes in short-term loans with extremely high interest. She expects fast repayment and uses her network of thugs to ensure compliance.

#### **Loan Terms**:

- **Interest Rate**: Very high (20-25%)
- **Collateral**: No collateral required, but the players’ safety is at stake if they don’t repay.
- **Repayment Period**: Short-term repayment (within 30 days of acquiring the loan).
- **Consequences**: Failure to repay the loan results in violent repercussions, including attacks on the players, destruction of their ship, or forced service in the loanshark’s criminal network.

---

### **Key Considerations**

When choosing to take a loan, players must consider the following:

1. **Risk vs. Reward**:
    
    - Noble families offer lower risks but demand loyalty and favors. Merchant companies provide structured repayment through service, while loansharks provide quick loans but with severe consequences.
2. **Interest Rates**:
    
    - Players should weigh the interest rates carefully. Loans from noble families or merchant companies have manageable rates, but loansharks can quickly spiral into debt traps due to the high interest rates.
3. **Reputation Impact**:
    
    - Depending on the source of the loan, the players' reputation may be affected. Taking a loan from a loanshark could lead to future difficulties with legal authorities, while a loan from a noble family or merchant company might open up political and trading opportunities.

---

### **Negotiating Loan Terms**

Players may attempt to negotiate better terms or interest rates based on their charisma and persuasion skills.

#### **Skill Checks**:

- **Charisma (Persuasion) (DC 15-18)**: To negotiate better terms, such as lowering interest rates, extending the repayment period, or reducing the required service or collateral.
- **Insight (DC 14)**: To assess whether the lender has hidden motives or if the deal is truly beneficial to the players.
- **Deception (DC 16)**: To provide false collateral or make promises they don’t intend to keep (though this comes with significant risks if discovered).

---

### **Potential Outcomes**

The choice of lender and loan terms will have long-term effects on the campaign. Players must decide if they are willing to take on these risks, as failure to repay loans can lead to serious consequences.

#### **Positive Outcomes**:

- **Noble or Merchant Favors**: Successfully repaying a loan from a noble family or merchant company could result in long-term alliances, discounted goods, and new trade routes.
- **Reputation Boost**: Establishing a reputation for reliability and resourcefulness by repaying a loan can lead to better deals and opportunities in future interactions.

#### **Negative Outcomes**:

- **Violent Consequences**: Failure to repay a loanshark could result in violent retaliation, with thugs attacking the players or sabotaging their ship.
- **Debt Trap**: High interest rates from loansharks can quickly lead to the players becoming trapped in a cycle of debt, requiring them to take on even more dangerous tasks to escape.
- **Loss of Ship**: Merchant companies may repossess the players’ ship if they fail to meet repayment terms, forcing them to continue the campaign without their vessel.

---

### **Quest Tie-Ins**

Taking a loan may open up new quests or obligations. For example:

- **Noble Family Quests**: Players may be called upon to perform favors for the noble family that loaned them money, such as investigating political rivals or securing trade routes.
- **Merchant Company Missions**: Players may be tasked with transporting valuable cargo or securing exclusive deals in distant lands as part of their repayment plan.
- **Loanshark Demands**: If players fall behind on payments, loansharks might demand they undertake dangerous smuggling runs or engage in illegal activities to make up for the debt.

---

### **Example Narrator Prompts**

- **Noble Family Loan**:
    
    > "Lord Edric Whitemane leans back in his chair, studying you carefully. ‘You’ve proven resourceful,’ he says, ‘and I’m willing to extend you a loan for your venture. But know this: loyalty is not a choice—it is expected. Fail me, and I will ensure you regret it.’"
    
- **Merchant Company Loan**:
    
    > "Baldor Blackwell steeples his fingers as he leans forward. ‘I can provide the loan you need, but you will deliver goods for me as part of the repayment. Fail to meet your end of the bargain, and I’ll ensure your business dries up.’"
    
- **Loanshark Loan**:
    
    > "Garvin ‘The Blade’ Thorne sneers as he hands over a bag of gold. ‘This is the easiest part,’ he says. ‘You’ll have to pay me back double in a month—or else I’ll collect in ways you won’t like.’"
    

---

## Compressed Connections

1. **[[Leviathan’s Lore]]**: Taking a loan helps the players secure the ship needed to explore the seas and uncover the secrets of [[Leviathan’s Lore]].
2. **[[Noble Families and Merchant Companies]]**: Loans from noble families and merchant companies offer a way to build alliances or gain resources that will be crucial as the campaign progresses.
3. **[[Criminal Networks]]**: Loans from loansharks can entangle the players in the criminal underworld, forcing them to navigate complex and dangerous relationships while trying to repay their debts.

[[Elowen]] and the crew scramble to secure the ship, knowing that they are heading into a deadly storm that may hold more than just rain and thunder.

**Narrator**:

> "The sky darkens as clouds roll in from all directions, swallowing the horizon in a blanket of black. The wind howls through the sails, and the sea itself begins to churn, as though the water has become a living entity. Lightning cracks across the sky, illuminating the massive storm front bearing down on the ship. This is no ordinary storm—there is something unnatural about it, something tied to the forces you’ve been chasing."

---

### **Surviving the Storm**

---

### **Consequences of the Storm**

Whether the players succeed or fail in navigating the storm, the ship will likely sustain some damage, and the crew may suffer losses. These consequences will affect the players' progress and morale as they continue their journey.

#### **Ship Damage**:

- **Minor Damage**: If the players succeed in most of their skill checks, the ship only sustains minor damage that can be repaired at sea or at the next port.
- **Severe Damage**: If the players fail multiple skill checks or combat encounters, the ship sustains severe damage, slowing their journey and potentially requiring significant repairs.

#### **Crew Morale**:

- **High Morale**: If the players successfully navigate the storm and maintain crew morale, the crew feels confident and motivated, boosting their performance in future encounters.
- **Low Morale**: If the players fail to keep morale high, the crew becomes disheartened, and future skill checks related to the ship or crew may have disadvantage.

---

### **After the Storm**

As the storm subsides, the players find themselves in calmer waters. However, the damage to the ship and the strain on the crew are evident. The players must now decide whether to push forward to their next destination or make repairs and gather resources before continuing.

**Narrator**:

> "The storm finally begins to fade, the winds dying down and the sea settling beneath you. The ship is battered, the sails torn, and the crew exhausted. But you have survived.

A sudden storm catches the crew off guard, testing the players' ability to work together and handle the unpredictable forces of nature. Dark clouds gather, the winds pick up, and the sea becomes a tumultuous force, threatening to capsize the ship.

**Narrator**:

> "The air grows heavy, and the sky darkens without warning. Lightning crackles in the distance, and the wind howls as the first waves crash against the hull of the ship. The crew shouts orders, scrambling to secure the rigging, while the ship is tossed like a toy in the storm’s grip. This is no ordinary storm—something far more sinister lurks beneath the surface of the waves."

#### **Key Challenges During the Storm**:

1. **Navigating the Storm**:
    
    - **Wisdom (Survival) (DC 15)**: To steer the ship through the storm and avoid capsizing.
    - **Dexterity (Acrobatics) (DC 14)**: To keep footing on the slippery deck and secure the sails.

    - **Strength (Athletics) (DC 13)**: To secure the sails and tie down loose cargo before it’s swept overboard.
    - **Constitution Saving Throw (DC 12)**: To resist exhaustion and maintain focus throughout the storm.
3. **Magical Interference**:
    
    - The storm may have magical origins, tied to the disrupted ocean currents. Players who succeed on an **Arcana (DC 14)** check may sense that the storm is influenced by the same magic as [[Leviathan’s Lore]].

#### **Outcome**:

- **Success**: The players manage to steer the ship through the storm with minimal damage, learning valuable lessons about teamwork and survival.
- **Failure**: The ship sustains significant damage, some supplies are lost, or crew members are injured, requiring downtime for repairs and recovery.

### **First Encounters with Pirates**

As the storm clears, the players encounter a pirate ship—the infamous **Black Scourge**—lurking on the horizon. The pirates see the players' ship as easy prey after the storm and prepare to attack.

**Narrator**:

> "The storm finally subsides, and the sea calms. But as the fog clears, you spot dark sails on the horizon. A pirate ship, its flag emblazoned with a skull, cuts through the water toward you.

As the players continue their journey, they begin to notice strange occurrences tied to the disruption of the ocean currents and [[Leviathan’s Lore]]. These early signs are subtle but ominous, hinting at the larger dangers that lie ahead.

**Narrator**:

> "The sea begins to change—strange currents flow against the wind, and creatures of the deep move closer to the surface. You catch glimpses of massive shadows beneath the waves, and the sky above seems to darken unnaturally. Something ancient stirs beneath the ocean’s surface, something tied to the legends of the [[Leviathan]]."

### The Secret Room on Elowen’s Ship


**The Secret Room on Elowen’s Ship**

**Tags**: #Ship #SecretRoom #Elowen #SeaSerpent #HiddenCompartment #LeviathansLore

## Overview

Aboard [[Elowen's Ship: The Sea Serpent]] lies a hidden room known as **De Geheime Ruimte** (The Secret Room). This magically concealed compartment is only known to a select few and serves as a critical part of the campaign. The room is used to store valuable, dangerous, or secret items, including documents related to [[Leviathan’s Lore]] and other vital artifacts.

---

### **Purpose of the Secret Room**

The **Secret Room** is hidden deep in the lower deck of the ship and is accessible only through a specific incantation known by [[Elowen]] and a few trusted members of her crew. Its existence is a closely guarded secret, making it the perfect place to conceal items that must not fall into the wrong hands.

#### **Key Uses**:

- **Artifact Storage**: The room is often used to hide magical artifacts, dangerous relics, or research documents crucial to the campaign’s progression.
- **Contraband or Smuggling**: Given its hidden nature, the room is sometimes used to store contraband or smuggled goods, allowing the ship to pass unnoticed by authorities.
- **Plot-Relevant Clues**: Items or documents found in this room may lead to critical discoveries about the [[Leviathan]] and the ancient forces affecting the oceans.

---

### **Room Mechanics**

1. **Magical Concealment**:
    
    - The room is protected by a powerful illusion spell that makes it invisible to anyone not aware of its existence. Those who know of the room must speak the incantation to reveal its entrance.
    - **Illusion Spell**: **DC 16 Investigation** or **DC 18 Arcana** to sense the presence of hidden magic. Only players with knowledge of the incantation or those with exceptional skills in detecting magic can find the room.
2. **Physical Protection**:
    
    - In addition to its magical defenses, the room is reinforced with enchanted wood and iron, making it resistant to forced entry.
    - **Breaking In**: Attempts to force the door open without the incantation require a **DC 20 Strength (Athletics)** check or the use of powerful magic such as **Dispel Magic (DC 17)** to bypass the enchantments.

---

### **Contents of the Secret Room**

The items stored in **De Geheime Ruimte** are often of significant importance to the campaign and may change depending on the situation. Here are some key items that could be stored in the room:

1. **Ancient Documents**:
    
    - Detailed research papers or ancient manuscripts related to [[Leviathan’s Lore]]. These documents contain critical information about the disruption of the ocean currents and the impending dangers to the [[Icewind Dales]].
2. **Magical Artifacts**:
    
    - Rare and powerful items that might aid the party in their journey. Some of these artifacts could be tied to the lost civilizations that once ruled the seas or the powerful beings connected to the Leviathan.
3. **Smuggled Goods**:
    
    - Items that [[Elowen]] and her crew may be transporting secretly, including rare potions, enchanted weapons, or illegal contraband that could be sold or used in the campaign.
4. **Protective Items**:
    
    - **Wards** and **Seals**: The room might contain magical wards or seals designed to protect against threats, such as sea monsters or pirate raids. These could be used by the party to bolster their defenses during encounters.

---

### **Role in the Campaign**

The **Secret Room** plays a significant role in the overall narrative of the campaign. It is a place where the party can uncover hidden truths and gather essential clues for the next steps of their journey. [[Elowen]] might introduce the players to this hidden room when she deems them trustworthy enough or if the campaign plot demands it.

#### **Story Integration**:

- **Leviathan’s Lore**: The room may hold the final pieces of information the party needs to fully understand the mysteries of [[Leviathan’s Lore]].
- **Betrayal or Deception**: If enemies become aware of the room's existence, it may serve as the site of an ambush, a heist, or a moment of betrayal.
- **Puzzle Element**: The players might need to solve a riddle or puzzle to unlock the room, involving the ship’s history or an ancient navigational spell​.

---

### **Possible Encounters and Consequences**

1. **Unwanted Discovery**:
    
    - If the wrong person learns about the **Secret Room**, it could lead to a confrontation or a theft attempt. Pirates, rival factions, or even members of the crew might try to gain access to the hidden treasures inside.
    - **Combat or Diplomacy**: The players may need to defend the room from intruders or negotiate with a faction seeking what lies within.
2. **Mystical Traps**:
    
    - The room is protected by a series of magical traps that activate if an unauthorized person attempts to enter. These traps could involve:
        - **Ensnaring Magic**: A spell that immobilizes or paralyzes intruders.
        - **Elemental Wards**: Traps that release bursts of fire, ice, or electricity to deter unwanted guests.
3. **Uncovering a Key Artifact**:
    
    - A vital artifact hidden in the room could unlock further progress in the campaign. This might be a lost relic, a magical weapon, or a powerful scroll containing ancient knowledge about the [[Leviathan]].

Just as the players find a stable course, the sky darkens, and a sudden storm descends upon the ship, freezing the rigging and limiting visibility.

**Narrator**:

> "The wind howls across the deck as the storm hits. Snow whips across the ship, and the temperature drops sharply. Visibility drops to almost nothing, and the freezing wind bites at your exposed skin."

#### **Skill Challenges**:

- **Constitution Saving Throw (DC 12)**: To endure the biting cold and keep working through the freezing storm.
    
    - **Narrator**: "The cold seeps deep into your bones, but you grit your teeth and push on, knowing the survival of the ship depends on your resilience."
- **Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) (DC 15)**: To untangle frozen ropes and secure the sails.
    
    - **Narrator**: "The ropes are stiff with ice, and your fingers are numb as you try to untangle them. With quick thinking, you manage to secure the sails before they tear in the fierce wind."

    - **Narrator**: "You call upon your knowledge of the arcane or nature, seeking a way to shield the ship from the storm's wrath. A well-placed incantation or clever insight could be the key to guiding the crew safely through the tempest."

---

### **Outcome**

- **Success**: The players successfully navigate through the maze of icebergs and survive the storm, emerging with only minor damage to the ship. The [[Icewind Dales]] loom ahead as the storm subsides, and the crew breathes a sigh of relief.
    
    - **Narrator**: "As the storm begins to subside, the sea calms, and you find yourselves sailing through quieter waters. The icy peaks of the [[Icewind Dales]] rise on the horizon—a land of cold and mystery. You have survived the first test of your journey, but greater challenges lie ahead."
- **Failure**: If the players fail to navigate the icebergs or withstand the storm, the ship takes significant damage. Supplies may be lost, crew members injured, or the ship even trapped in ice.
    
    - **Narrator**: "The ship lurches violently as it collides with an unseen iceberg. The sound of splintering wood echoes across the frozen landscape, and by the time the storm passes, the ship is battered, the crew injured, and valuable supplies lost to the icy waters."

### Scene 2 Encounter with the Icewardens


**Scene 2: Encounter with the Icewardens**

**Tags**: #CampaignScene #Icewardens #FrozenGuardians #DiplomacyOrCombat #IcewindDales

## Introduction

As the players press onward through the storm, the world around them becomes an eerie landscape of swirling snow and icy fog. Suddenly, looming figures emerge from the mist—beings made of ice and snow, ancient guardians of the [[Icewind Dales]], known as the [[Icewardens]]. These creatures are tasked with protecting the region from intruders, and they have now taken an interest in the players' ship.

**Narrator**:

> "The storm begins to subside, the howling wind softens to a whisper, and the thick fog surrounding your ship starts to lift. As the visibility improves, you spot towering shapes in the distance. At first, they appear to be icebergs, but as they draw nearer, you realize these are no ordinary ice formations. They move with purpose, their bodies shifting and flowing like living ice. Their pale blue light glows from within their forms, and their eyes—if they can be called that—shine with an eerie ancient light. These are the [[Icewardens]], protectors of the frozen north, and they are now watching you."

---

### **Phase 1: Initial Contact**

The players must decide how to approach the [[Icewardens]]. These guardians are not mindless attackers but ancient beings who protect the [[Icewind Dales]] from perceived threats. The players have the opportunity to negotiate safe passage or, if diplomacy fails, prepare for a challenging battle.

#### **Actions**:

- **Diplomatic Approach**:
    
    - **Persuasion (DC 16)**: To communicate with the [[Icewardens]], explaining the players’ peaceful intentions and important mission. Success allows the players to appeal to the guardians' sense of duty.
        - **Narrator**: "You raise your voice, steady despite the cold, explaining that you seek not to harm these lands but to protect them from a greater danger. The glowing eyes of the [[Icewardens]] narrow as they listen. After a moment of tense silence, one of the [[Icewardens]] steps forward, seeming to consider your words."
- **Understanding the Icewardens**:
    
    - **Insight (DC 14)**: To read the [[Icewardens]]' motives and emotions. Understanding that these beings are wary protectors may help frame the players' words and actions.
        - **Narrator**: "You focus on the lead [[Icewarden]], observing the subtle movements of the group and how the other guardians defer to it. Though featureless, their body language suggests caution, not malice. These beings are testing your resolve and intentions."
- **Preparation for Combat**:
    
    - If diplomacy fails, or if the players opt for a more direct approach, they can prepare for combat. The [[Icewardens]] are formidable opponents, and the players will need to use strategy to overcome them.
        - **Narrator**: "The [[Icewardens]] do not respond to your words. Instead, they move closer, the frost around them thickening. They have judged you a threat and will not allow you to pass without a fight."

---

### **Phase 2: Combat Encounter**

If diplomacy fails, the players face a challenging battle against the [[Icewardens]]. These creatures are physically powerful and connected to the icy environment, giving them unique abilities that can turn the tide of combat.

#### **Icewarden Stats**:

- **Armor Class**: 16
- **Hit Points**: 90 (10d10+30)
- **Attack**: Ice Spear (+6 to hit, 2d8+4 piercing damage + 1d8 cold damage)
- **Frost Aura**: Creatures within 10 feet of the [[Icewarden]] must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage per turn.

#### **Combat Strategy**:

- **Coordinated Attacks**: The [[Icewardens]] fight with intelligence, attempting to surround the players and force them into the range of their Frost Aura, where players will suffer continuous cold damage.
    
    - **Narrator**: "The [[Icewardens]] move with eerie precision, circling your group and forcing you into a tighter formation. The air grows colder as the frost gnaws at your limbs, sapping your strength."
- **Defensive Magic**: The players can use defensive spells or abilities to mitigate the cold damage, such as **Protection from Energy (Cold)**. Fire-based spells, like **Fireball**, could also be effective in melting the ice.
    
    - **Narrator**: "You summon a barrier of warmth around yourself, shielding against the worst of the cold. As the [[Icewarden]]'s spear strikes, the heat drives back the freezing chill."
- **Environmental Awareness**: The icy terrain could provide opportunities for creative tactics, such as using the ice to slide out of range or forcing an [[Icewarden]] onto a patch of thin ice.
    
    - **Narrator**: "The ground beneath your feet is slick with ice, making movement difficult. But you see an opportunity—if you push one of the [[Icewardens]] onto the thinner ice, it could fall through and become trapped."

---

### **Outcome**

#### **Success in Diplomacy**:

If the players succeed in their **Persuasion** check, the [[Icewardens]] acknowledge their peaceful intentions and allow them to pass unharmed. They may even offer guidance as the players approach the [[Icewind Dales]].

- **Narrator**: "The [[Icewardens]] pause, their forms shifting slightly as if in silent communication. The lead [[Icewarden]] nods, and the others step aside, clearing a path for your ship. One of them extends a hand, pointing toward a safer route through the ice."

#### **Victory in Combat**:

If the players defeat the [[Icewardens]], they can continue their journey but at a cost. Defeating these ancient guardians may draw the attention of other powerful entities in the region.

- **Narrator**: "The last of the [[Icewardens]] shatters into a thousand shards of glittering ice, its light fading into darkness. The frozen bodies of the guardians lie scattered around you, but you can’t shake the feeling that something—someone—has noticed their fall."

#### **Failure**:

If the players fail to negotiate or are overwhelmed in combat, they may be forced to retreat or find another way around, delaying their journey and exposing them to further dangers.

- **Narrator**: "The cold is too much, and the [[Icewardens]] close in relentlessly. You are forced to give the order to retreat. The ship pulls away from the guardians, but the path to the [[Icewind Dales]] seems even more perilous now."

## Narration

As the party leaves the relative safety of the surface waters, they descend into the eerie twilight of the deep ocean. The world around them changes as sunlight fades and the water grows colder. Strange bioluminescent creatures—some small, others as large as the party’s ship—drift by, casting ghostly blue light.

[[Elder Cetus]] swims ahead, his massive form offering comfort as his telepathic voice provides guidance. Finally, the party sees the mouth of the cave—a vast, lightless chasm at the ocean floor.

> "This is the place," Cetus’s voice echoes in your minds. "Stay close and be mindful of the currents. The path ahead is treacherous."

---

### **Stage 1: The Entrance Cavern**

The first chamber is unexpectedly spacious, a vast cavern lined with twisted coral formations. Luminous algae clings to the rocks, casting a faint green glow. Breathable air pockets shimmer near the ceiling, providing respite from the water.

**Description**:

- The temperature has dropped noticeably, and the pressure is starting to build. The only sounds are the hum of the water and distant echoes.

**Encounters**:

- **Environmental Hazard**: A sudden shift in the currents requires a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13) to avoid being swept into the jagged coral.
    - **Success**: The player steadies themselves.
    - **Failure**: The player takes 1d6 piercing damage and suffers minor disorientation (disadvantage on their next skill check or attack roll).

**Rest Point**:

- [[Elder Cetus]] suggests a brief rest to adjust to the increasing pressure. Players can regain health by spending Hit Dice or using healing potions. [[Elder Cetus]] can also heal for 2d8 + 4 HP and use **Greater Restoration** on any player affected by pressure-related effects.

> "You are doing well," Cetus says softly. "But we have only just begun. Gather your strength for we must continue soon."

### Stage 2 The Narrow Passage


**Stage 2: The Narrow Passage**

**Tags**: #CampaignSession #DeepSeaCave #ElderCetus #PressureHazards #NarrowPassage #EelNest

## Narration

As the party presses further into the cave, the walls close in around them, forcing them to move in single file. The cold intensifies, and the water pressure builds with every step. Darkness becomes nearly absolute, broken only by faint bioluminescent algae clinging to the walls.

[[Elder Cetus]]’s voice resonates in the party's minds:

> "Stay close and keep moving. The path is treacherous, but we must press on. The air grows thin, and the pressure builds. Remain strong, for there is a place to rest just ahead."

---

### **Description**

The passage is long, winding, and lined with jagged barnacle-encrusted rocks. These sharp formations threaten to tear at the party’s gear and skin if they are not careful. The cold and pressure create a stifling atmosphere, making each step feel like a battle against the crushing weight of the ocean above.

Midway through, the party finds a small alcove with an air pocket where they can briefly rest.

---

### **Skill Challenge: Pressure Build-Up**

As the party moves deeper, the water pressure becomes overwhelming.

- **Constitution Saving Throw (DC 14)**:
    - **Success**: The player withstands the pressure, continuing with only slight fatigue.
    - **Failure**: The player gains a level of exhaustion and suffers dizziness, affecting their ability to continue without further rest.

---

### **Rest Point: Breathable Pocket**

At the alcove, the party finds a small air pocket. [[Elder Cetus]] advises them to take a moment to breathe and recover. Cetus can use **Greater Restoration** on up to two players to alleviate the effects of exhaustion or pressure injuries.

- Players can spend Hit Dice to recover health or use healing items as needed.

> "Take a moment to rest," Cetus advises. "The pressure will only increase from here. Allow me to aid you."

---

### **Encounter: Eel Nest**

As the party resumes their journey, they notice a faint pulsing light in the distance. Upon closer inspection, they realize it is a nest of electric eels, agitated by the party’s presence.

> "Be cautious," Cetus warns. "These creatures are highly sensitive to movement and sound. We must not provoke them, or they may attack with deadly force."

---

**Mechanics**:

- **Animal Handling Check (DC 15)**:
    - **Success**: The eels are calmed, allowing the party to pass undisturbed.
    - **Failure**: The eels become more agitated, preparing to attack.
- **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 14)**:
    - **Success**: The player slips past the eels unnoticed.
    - **Failure**: The player disturbs the nest, triggering an electric attack (2d6 lightning damage).

---

## Compressed Connections

1. **[[Pressure Hazards]]**: The increasing deep-sea pressure will be a persistent threat, requiring constant monitoring and skill checks in future exploration.

### Stage 3 The Abyssal Drop


**Stage 3: The Abyssal Drop**

**Tags**: #CampaignSession #DeepSeaCave #AbyssalDrop #PressureHazards #GiantAnglerfish #ElderCetus

## Narration

The narrow tunnel the party has been navigating suddenly opens into a vast abyss. The floor drops away into darkness, with the depths below seemingly endless. The water grows colder and the pressure more intense, making each breath a struggle against the crushing weight of the ocean.

Strange glowing creatures drift far below, their light casting eerie shadows on the cavern walls. [[Elder Cetus]]’s telepathic voice resonates in the party's minds:

> "This is the Abyssal Drop, one of the deepest points in these caves. The way down is treacherous, but we must reach the bottom to continue our journey. Move carefully and stay close."

---

### **Description**

The Abyssal Drop is a massive open cavern, with slick, algae-covered walls dotted by ledges and tunnels. These ledges offer the only safe descent, but they are precarious and narrow. The path is treacherous, and one misstep could send the party plummeting into the abyss below.

The water is dense, frigid, and the pressure is nearly unbearable.

---

### **Skill Challenge: Navigating the Drop**

#### **Option 1: Slow Descent**

The party can carefully navigate the ledges and tunnels to control their descent.

- **Dexterity (Acrobatics) Check (DC 15)**:
    - **Success**: The player safely descends, using the ledges to maintain control.
    - **Failure**: The player slips and falls, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage. A second Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (DC 15) is required to regain control.

Multiple failures result in additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage as the player tumbles further down the abyss.

#### **Option 2: Jumping into the Abyss**

For the more daring, players can choose to leap and descend rapidly.

- **Dexterity (Acrobatics) Check (DC 18)**:
    - **Success**: The player controls their fall, landing on a larger ledge. They take 2d6 bludgeoning damage but reach the bottom quickly.
    - **Failure**: The player plummets uncontrollably, taking 4d6 bludgeoning damage upon landing. A Constitution saving throw (DC 15) is required to avoid falling unconscious.

---

### **Skill Challenge: Pressure Sickness**

As the party descends deeper, the pressure increases dramatically, threatening to overwhelm them.

- **Constitution Saving Throw (DC 15)**:
    - **Success**: The player withstands the pressure but feels strained.
    - **Failure**: The player gains a level of exhaustion and takes 1d8 psychic damage. If already suffering from exhaustion, the player takes an additional level and 2d8 psychic damage.

---

### **Encounter: Giant Anglerfish**

As the party reaches the bottom, a faint eerie light pulses rhythmically in the distance. Suddenly, the light swings toward them, revealing the massive, gaping maw of a **Giant Anglerfish**. Drawn by their descent, the creature charges forward, its powerful tail propelling it through the water.

> [[Elder Cetus]]’s voice booms in the party's minds: "Stay behind me! I will fend off the creature—strike when you see an opening!"

---

**Giant Anglerfish Stats**:

- **Armor Class**: 14
- **Hit Points**: 102 (12d10+36)

- **Luring Light**: Emits a hypnotic light as a bonus action (30 ft. radius). DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed and incapacitated for 1 minute.

---

**Combat Strategy**:

- **Giant Anglerfish Tactics**: The anglerfish will attempt to grapple players with its bite and use its **Luring Light** to charm the party. Its massive size and confined environment make it a formidable opponent.

**[[Elder Cetus]]’s Assistance**:

- **Tail Swipe**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft. Hit: 22 (3d10+6) bludgeoning damage. Distracts the anglerfish, giving the party advantage on attack rolls.
- **Protective Aura**: Grants resistance to piercing and bludgeoning damage for 1 minute (1/day).
- **Greater Restoration**: Removes exhaustion, paralysis, or charm effects if a player is incapacitated.

---

### **After the Battle**

With the anglerfish defeated, silence falls once more. The darkness presses in, but the immediate danger has passed. [[Elder Cetus]] surveys the area and ensures the path is clear before urging the party onward. Though drained from the battle, there is no time to rest—the journey must continue.

---

## Compressed Connections

1. **[[Deep-Sea Monsters]]**: The anglerfish encounter foreshadows greater deep-sea dangers, hinting at the possibility of even more deadly creatures lurking in the abyss.
2. **[[Pressure Hazards]]**: The intense deep-sea pressure and exhaustion mechanics will continue to challenge the party, forcing them to manage their health and resources carefully.

### Stage 4 The Silent Grave


**Stage 4: The Silent Grave**

**Tags**: #CampaignSession #DeepSeaCave #TheSilentGrave #OrcaAmbush #WhaleMessenger #ElderCetus

## Narration

As the party emerges from the abyssal drop, the currents fade, and the water becomes eerily still. Silence fills the space, broken only by the thud of the party’s heartbeat in their ears. The darkness is thick, and the faint glow of bioluminescent algae barely illuminates the surroundings. Ahead lies a small, secluded cave, partially hidden by fallen rocks and coral. The narrow entrance seems like the ocean itself is concealing what lies within.

Inside, the sight is grim—a massive whale’s corpse lies at the center of the chamber, its body covered in deep, ragged scars and wounds. The haunting scene reveals that this was no peaceful death. The clouded eyes of the whale tell a story of pain and desperation. This is the fallen messenger [[Elder Cetus]] spoke of, who fought bravely before finding refuge here in his final moments.

> [[Elder Cetus]]’s voice is filled with sorrow: "This is the one we sought. He fought bravely, but his journey ended here. We must honor his sacrifice and recover what he carried, for it holds the key to understanding the threats that lie ahead."

---

### **Description**

The cave is small and claustrophobic. The only light comes from faint glowing algae and the dim bioluminescence lingering on the whale’s body. The water feels thick and heavy, weighed down by the deep ocean pressure, and the atmosphere is oppressive.

---

### **Skill Challenge: Investigating the Corpse**

Approaching the whale’s body is emotionally difficult, but the party knows that vital answers lie with this fallen messenger.

- **Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Medicine) Check (DC 14)**:
    - **Success**: The party discerns that the whale was attacked by a pod of orcas. The deep, ragged wounds indicate multiple attackers. Among the whale’s remains, the party finds a sealed container clutched tightly in its fins—likely the messages [[Elder Cetus]] mentioned.
    - **Failure**: Though they struggle to determine the exact nature of the attack, the evidence still points to orca aggression. The party finds the sealed messages but takes longer to retrieve them, leaving them vulnerable to an impending threat.

---

### **Encounter: Orca Ambush**

As the party secures the sealed messages, the silence is shattered by the distant, haunting calls of orcas. The sound grows closer, more urgent, as the walls of the cave seem to close in.

> "Prepare yourselves!" [[Elder Cetus]] warns. "The orcas have found us. We must defend ourselves and ensure these messages make it to the surface."

---

**Orca Pod Stats**:

- **Orca Pod**: 3 Orcas
- **Armor Class**: 12
- **Hit Points**: 76 each (8d10+24)
- **Speed**: Swim 60 ft.

**Abilities**:

- **Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8+6) piercing damage. If the bite attack hits, the target is grappled (escape DC 14).
- **Tail Slap**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d6+6) bludgeoning damage. Target must make a Strength saving throw (DC 14) or be knocked prone.
- **Echolocation (Recharge 5-6)**: Emits a burst of sound in a 60-foot cone. Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15), taking 22 (4d10) thunder damage on a failed save. Creatures that fail the save are also deafened for 1 minute.

---

### **Combat Strategy**

- **Orca Tactics**: The orcas will use their speed and strength to flank and isolate weaker party members. They will attempt to grapple with their bite attacks, pulling targets away from the group and disorienting them with their **Echolocation** ability.

**[[Elder Cetus]]’s Assistance**:

- **Tail Swipe**: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10+6) bludgeoning damage. Cetus’s tail can create openings for the party to strike.
- **Protective Aura (1/day)**: Cetus can grant all allies within 30 feet resistance to piercing and bludgeoning damage for 1 minute, mitigating the orcas’ attacks.
- **Greater Restoration**: If a player is incapacitated, Cetus can use **Greater Restoration** to remove exhaustion, paralysis, or charm effects, ensuring the party can continue to fight.

---

### **Narration for Combat**

The orcas attack with terrifying speed and ferocity, their tails creating shockwaves in the water. Their powerful bites threaten to drag party members into the darkness, but [[Elder Cetus]] fights back fiercely, his massive form shielding the party from the worst of the attacks. His tail strikes with the force of a battering ram, creating space for the party to fend off the ambush.

---

### **After the Battle**

With the orcas defeated, the cave falls silent once again. However, the stillness now feels less oppressive. [[Elder Cetus]] surveys the area, his sorrow for the fallen messenger palpable, yet there is a sense of relief. The messages have been recovered, and the knowledge they carry will not be lost.

> "We have what we came for," Cetus intones, his voice calm but tinged with sadness. "Let us return to the surface with all haste. The way ahead is clear, but we must remain vigilant. Together, we will honor the messenger’s sacrifice."

The party begins the ascent, carrying the weight of the fallen messenger and the vital messages that may hold the key to understanding the dangers that lie ahead.

## Compressed Connections

1. **[[Orca Aggression]]**: The ambush reveals an increase in orca hostility, hinting at larger forces at play, potentially tied to the [[Abyssal Cult]].
2. **[[Whale Messenger]]**: The party has recovered key messages from the fallen whale, which may reveal critical information about the threats looming in the depths.

![[dd85f230-3e42-42c2-94b5-8a025c4cf8f1-2.webp]]

**Location:** A sprawling coastal hideout carved into the cliffs, filled with tunnels, chambers, and concealed passages.

**Details:**

- **Entry Point:** The group begins at the edge of the cove after escaping their cell, armed with their gear.
    - The environment is dark and damp, with echoes of footsteps and muted voices from deeper within. The walls are slick with moisture, and the faint smell of salt lingers in the air.
    - **Read-Aloud Description:** "You stand at the edge of a shadowed cavern, its damp stone walls reflecting faint glimmers of torchlight from deeper within. The sound of distant voices and the rhythmic crash of waves echo faintly, blending with the dripping of water. Near the entrance, a crude map scrawled on the wall catches your eye, its charcoal lines depicting what appears to be storage rooms, a meeting chamber, and a small altar. Loose stones crunch softly underfoot, urging caution with every step."
    - **Interactable Element:** A map scrawled on the wall ([[Perception]] DC 12) reveals the layout of the cove, including storage rooms, a meeting chamber, and a small altar.

    - Two [[Stormcaller Operatives]] patrol the area, discussing the recently captured [[Wizards]].
    - **Read-Aloud Description:** "Ahead, two figures move methodically through the cavern, their footsteps deliberate but softened by the damp earth. Snatches of conversation drift your way—something about 'preparations for the shrine' and 'ensuring no interruptions.'"
    - **Interactable Element:** Players can overhear their conversation by remaining hidden ([[Stealth]] DC 12). This provides hints about the [[Tidecaller Shrine]] and a possible ritual in progress.
    - If spotted, the guards attempt to alert others, leading to reinforcements arriving in three rounds.
2. **Hidden Passage:**
    
    - A concealed door in the rock face ([[Investigation]] DC 15) leads to a shortcut that bypasses heavily guarded areas.
    - **Read-Aloud Description:** "Your eyes catch faint scratches near the base of the cavern wall, where a subtle seam runs vertically. The faint smell of oil wafts from a nearly invisible gap, suggesting frequent use and hidden mechanisms."
    - **Interactable Element:** Scratches on the floor near the door hint at frequent use, and the faint smell of oil suggests a lantern or tools stored within.

**Environmental Hazards:**

- **Loose Rocks:** Moving quickly without caution may cause a cascade of stones ([[Dexterity Save]] DC 12) that alerts nearby guards.
- **Dim Lighting:** Shadows flicker unpredictably, providing ample cover for stealth but making [[Perception]] checks (DC +2) slightly harder.

**Loot and Clues:**

- A discarded **[[Stormcaller Journal]]** near a crate provides insight into their revolutionary goals and mentions "blessings from the depths." The handwriting is hurried, with one page referencing the "shrine’s ancient power".
- A small crate contains:
    - 15 GP worth of smuggled goods.
    - A [[Potion of Healing]].
    - A crude sketch of the [[Tidecaller Shrine]] marked with runes. Close examination (Arcana DC 13) reveals the runes are of Abyssal origin, hinting at external influence.

    - **Read-Aloud Description:** "The rowboat creaks against the turbulent waves, the faint light of Waterdeep fading as you’re dragged further into the stormy expanse. Four shadowy figures row methodically, their backs hunched and faces obscured. A captain stands at the helm, his eyes locked on you with grim determination. On the distant dock, a familiar figure—young Timmy—waves frantically, his small voice barely audible over the growing crash of waves."
- **Environment:** The waters are choppy, with storm clouds brewing, adding to the tension.
    - Lightning flashes intermittently, briefly illuminating the grim scene. The air is heavy with the scent of salt and storm.

        - On a **1–9**, he struggles with the boat, drawing attention and needing the wizards to save him.
    - **Read-Aloud Description (15+):** "With surprising determination, Timmy quietly maneuvers the dinghy across the churning waves. His face is etched with focus, and at just the right moment, he tosses a small blade toward you, his whispered encouragement carried away by the storm."
    - **Read-Aloud Description (1–9):** "Timmy rows awkwardly against the storm, his efforts drawing shouts from the guards. 'What’s that kid doing?' one of them growls as they turn their attention toward the struggling boy."

    - **Interactable Element:** The captain’s visible discomfort when pressed about the "blessings from the depths" hints at his deeper fears.
3. **Breaking Free:** Athletics (DC 15) or Dexterity (DC 14) to slip out of their bindings.
    
    - **Interactable Element:** Wet ropes fray slightly when twisted or rubbed against the rough wooden planks.

    - **Interactable Element:** Water sloshing over the sides makes the boat unstable, providing an opportunity for coordinated action.

**Cliffhanger Transition:**

- Just as the wizards begin to turn the tide, the [[Stormcaller Captain]] reveals an amulet marked with [[Abyssal]] symbols, invoking dark powers for a final effort to ensure their deaths.
    - **Read-Aloud Description:** "With a sneer, the captain reaches beneath his cloak and produces a strange amulet, its surface etched with glowing, otherworldly symbols. The air seems to shift as he raises it, the storm intensifying around you. 'You’ll not escape the blessings of the depths,' he growls, his voice carrying an unnatural resonance."

### **[[Scene 1 Rogue and Fighters in Stormbreaker Cove]]**

**Location:** A sprawling coastal hideout carved into the cliffs, filled with tunnels, chambers, and concealed passages.

**Objective:** Navigate the cove, remain undetected, and uncover critical information about the Stormcallers’ operations.

**Details:**

- **Entry Point:** The group begins at the edge of the cove after escaping their cell, armed with their gear.
    - The environment is dark and damp, with echoes of footsteps and muted voices from deeper within.
    - A map scrawled on the wall (Perception DC 12) reveals the layout of the cove, including storage rooms, a meeting chamber, and a small altar.

**Encounters:**

1. **Patrolling Guards:**
    - **Skill Challenge:** Use Stealth (DC 14), Deception (disguise themselves), or creative distractions to avoid detection.
    - **Combat Option:** If engaged, quickly silence the guards before reinforcements arrive (2 rounds before alarm is raised).
2. **Secret Passage:**
    - A hidden door (Investigation DC 15) leads to an unguarded tunnel. The passage is ancient, with faded symbols (Arcana or Religion DC 14 to connect to Abyssal influences).
3. **Storage Room:**
    - Contains crates with smuggled weapons and supplies. Searching reveals:
        - **Stormcaller Manifesto:** Their revolutionary goals against "oppression and tyranny."
        - **Cult Symbols:** A faintly glowing sigil beneath a crate hints at an Abyssal Cult's influence (Religion DC 13 to recognize as unnatural).

**Clues and Revelations:**

- **Documents:** Notes indicate the Stormcallers unknowingly serve a deeper agenda, with references to “ancient allies” and “strength from the depths.”
- **NPC Hints:** Eavesdropping guards discuss mysterious backers providing resources and "blessing" their cause.

**Cliffhanger Transition:** The group hears the faint chanting of a ritual from deeper in the cove, drawing them toward the **Tidecaller Shrine**.

### **[[Scene 2 Wizards in the Harbor]]**

**Location:** A rowboat leaving Waterdeep’s harbor, heading toward open water.

**Objective:** Escape the Stormcallers’ execution attempt and save **Timmy**.

**Details:**

- **Setup:** The wizards are bound and seated in the rowboat, with four Stormcaller enforcers rowing and a Captain overseeing the execution. Timmy is on the dock, waving and yelling, trying to signal them but avoiding direct confrontation.
- **Environment:** The waters are choppy, with storm clouds brewing, adding to the tension.

**Timmy’s Heroic Moment:**

- **Scene:** Timmy spots an unattended dinghy and, after a moment of hesitation, climbs in to follow the rowboat.
    - **Timmy’s Hero Roll:** Have the players roll a d20 for Timmy’s success.
        - On a **15+**, Timmy rows stealthily and gets close enough to provide aid (e.g., throwing a knife to the wizards or distracting the guards).
        - On a **10–14**, he reaches them but creates noise, prompting an additional guard to watch him.
        - On a **1–9**, he struggles with the boat, drawing attention and needing the wizards to save him.

**Wizard Challenges:**

1. **Subtle Spellcasting:** Use spells like **Mage Hand** or **Minor Illusion** to distract or disrupt the guards.
2. **Social Options:** Persuade the Captain to delay the execution with claims of valuable information (Persuasion DC 15) or intimidate them into faltering (Intimidation DC 14).
3. **Breaking Free:** Athletics (DC 15) or Dexterity (DC 14) to slip out of their bindings.
4. **Capsizing the Boat:** Clever use of spells (e.g., Thunderwave) or raw Strength (DC 16) to destabilize the rowboat.

**Cliffhanger Transition:** Just as the wizards begin to turn the tide, the Captain reveals an amulet marked with Abyssal symbols, invoking dark powers for a final effort to ensure their deaths.

---

### **[[Scene 3 Climax and Escape]]**

**Group A: Tidecaller Shrine**

- **Location:** A cavernous chamber deep within the cove, featuring an ancient stone altar covered in glowing Abyssal runes.
- **Challenges:**
    - Avoid detection from guards performing a ritual (Stealth DC 13).
    - **Investigate the Shrine:** Arcana (DC 14) or Religion (DC 12) to decipher the runes, revealing the Stormcallers’ unintentional connection to an Abyssal Cult.
    - **Optional Combat:** Sabotaging the ritual prompts 2 Stormcaller Operatives to attack, buying time for the party to escape.

**Group B: Fight for Survival**

- **Location:** Open water, with the wizards and Timmy in danger.
- **Final Challenge:** The Captain invokes dark powers to summon an aquatic creature (e.g., a giant octopus or spectral shark).
    - **Options:** Overpower the creature and guards through teamwork or creative spell use.
    - **Timmy’s Heroics:** If still active, Timmy distracts the Captain, providing the wizards an opening to end the fight.

---

### **[[Part 4 Resolution]]**

### **Quest Update: The Secrets of the Whalebones**

**Tags:** #IslandChain #TracklessSea #Whalebones #Pirates #SeaMonsters #AncientMystery #LostMemories

---

## **Following the Shamans Up the Boneway**

The **whale-worshipping shamans** move silently up the **Boneway**, the ancient path winding through jagged cliffs and towering **whale rib spires**. As the party follows, the wind howls through the bones, creating an unsettling harmony—a song not meant for mortal ears.

Their **guides wear scraps of ancient sailing uniforms**, now adorned with **woven seaweed and coral beads**. Their bodies are **marked with old sailor tattoos**, some altered into **ritual symbols**, while others remain untouched—fading reminders of the lives they once lived.

The deeper they ascend, the stronger the **humming vibration** in their bones. The memories of the journey itself feel **oddly fragile**, as if the island itself is **eroding thought like the tide wears away stone.**

---

### **1. The Truth of the Shamans**

At a plateau overlooking the island’s heart, the **leader of the shamans**, Isla, Keeper of the Bones, turns to the party and gestures at the valley below.

The view is haunting:

- **Scattered shipwrecks**, some so old they have turned to bone-like husks, dot the cliffs and jungle below.
- A **massive pit, lined with spiraled glyphs**, pulses with an unnatural glow.
- The ruins of an **ancient temple**, long submerged, rise from the mist-covered valley floor.

> **Isla speaks:**  
> _"We were once as you are now—lost, wrecked, searching for escape. But the island took us, and in return, we were given purpose."_

She places a **weathered journal** at the party’s feet. The pages are **blank**—the ink faded as if it had never been written.

> _"We do not remember where we came from. We do not remember the faces of those we once loved. We are all that remains, and we are less than we were."_

---

### **2. The Memory-Eater Beneath the Island**

The shamans **fear what lies in the deep**, but they do not fight it. Instead, they **guard the threshold**, ensuring that what is sealed **remains undisturbed**.

The valley below leads to the **subterranean ruin** where **the Nautilus Shell of the Abyss** hums its siren call. But beyond that—beneath the ruins—lies something older.

A **primordial presence**, bound to the **deepest cavern of the island**, feeds not on flesh, but on **memories themselves**.

- Those who wander too close **lose fragments of their past**—a name, a face, a home long forgotten.
- The **whale bones scattered across the island** are not just remains—they are **anchors for lost memories**, their stories carved into their ivory frames to preserve what the mind can no longer hold.
- The **longest survivors** among the shamans have forgotten nearly everything of their past lives—**only their purpose remains**.

---

### **3. The Descent into the Forgotten Depths**

The only path forward leads to the **sunken temple**, where the Abyssal Cult waits, hoping to claim the **Nautilus Shell of the Abyss**.

But if the party continues **deeper**…

- **Their own memories begin to fade**—subtle at first, then accelerating.
- **Intelligence Checks (DC 15)**: Players must make periodic checks to retain pieces of their personal history.
- **Failure Consequences**:
    - **A missing name**—for an NPC, a location, or even a loved one.
    - **Skills or abilities begin to slip**—a once-trained sailor forgetting how to tie a knot.
    - **A growing sense of unease**—as if something is watching, shifting through their thoughts.

---

### **4. The Thing Beneath the Bones**

At the island’s core lies **a great black abyss**, an open maw beneath the ruin, where no water flows—only **memories drift downward like falling embers.**

> _"Come closer."_  
> _"You have forgotten me before. You will forget me again."_

A presence stirs. Something **formless** and **vast**, older than the bones above, rises in the dark.

**The Memory-Eater.**

**What the party must decide:**

- **Destroy the Nautilus Shell**, sealing the creature forever but angering the **Abyssal Cult**.
- **Use the Shell** to bind it, though it will leave its mark upon them—**a piece of their own past erased forever**.
- **Flee**, though the price may already have been paid—their past unraveling with every step.

---

### **Potential Twists & Consequences**

- **If the Memory-Eater is freed**, the world will slowly begin **forgetting parts of itself**—names disappearing from history, entire civilizations becoming whispers on the tide.
- **If the party lingers too long**, they may **wake up on the beach**, missing the entire journey, only faint echoes remaining.
- The shamans will not stop them, but they will **never remember the party’s faces** should they return.

---

### **Next Steps**

- Should there be **combat with the cult**, or a battle against the **Memory-Eater itself**?
- Would you like **specific mechanical effects** for lost memories?
- Should there be a **way to recover what’s been lost**, or is the price final?


### **Quest Update: The Secrets of the Whalebones**

**Tags:** #IslandChain #TracklessSea #Whalebones #Pirates #SeaMonsters #AncientMystery

#### **Current Situation**

After evading a **water elemental** that attempted to crush their rowboat, the party reaches the beach of **Bone Choir Isle** under a veil of mist. The tide crashes unnaturally against the shore, and **whale bones jut from the sand like twisted spires**. The rhythmic, humming song from deep within the island pulses through the air.

---

### **New Challenges Upon Landing**

#### **1. The Singing Beach**

- The sand **vibrates in sync with the eerie melody**, causing disorientation.
- **Skill Check (CON Save or Insight)**: Players must resist nausea or temporary hallucinations.
- **Failure Effect**: Shadows seem to **move on their own**, and the whispers of unseen voices creep into their minds.

#### **2. First Contact** – **The Bone Watchers**

- As the players advance, **skeletal figures** appear from the fog—**whale-worshipping shamans**, their bodies adorned with **ritualistic tattoos and carved whale ivory**.
- **They are neither hostile nor welcoming** but demand to know why the party has set foot on their sacred land.
- **Parley Options**:
    - **Respect the traditions** (offering tribute, learning the rites) – gain access peacefully.
    - **Use deception or intimidation** – may cause distrust but allow passage.
    - **Forceful entry** – results in a battle, making future interactions with the [[Whale-Worshipping Tribes of the Azure Isles]] more difficult.

---

### **New Locations Discovered**

#### **3. The Boneway** (Island’s Interior)

- A narrow path lined with **upright whale ribs** like a **cathedral of bones**.
- The deeper they travel, the **louder the humming becomes**, now interspersed with **deep, mournful wails** from below the island.
- **Encounter Possibilities**:
    - **Spirit Visions** – Echoes of the past, warning them of something **sealed beneath the island**.
    - **Whale Totem Traps** – If the wrong path is taken, **whale bones animate** to block their way or attack.

#### **4. The Submerged Temple**

- **Carved from a singular massive whale skull**, the entrance has ancient glyphs depicting **whales fighting a titanic serpent**.
- Players must **solve a puzzle** involving the island’s music to proceed.
- **Inside, the relic awaits... but so do the Abyssal Cultists.**

---

### **Abyssal Cult's Arrival**

- The **Abyssal Cult** has trailed the party, their longboat arriving just offshore.
- They do **not attack immediately**—they know the temple’s defenses require outsiders to enter first.
- Their leader, **Soraka the Drowned**, a woman with barnacle-covered skin, watches from the cliffs.
- **Tensions Build** – Will the party rush inside? Try to set a trap? Parley with the cult?

### Session 8.1

## Session Reports

### Session Report 2


They finished the encounter with the silver fins[[Encounter The Dolphin Traders]] they bought some stuff some scrolls maps couple of pearls and a luminescent seashell. 

They encountered [[The Black Scourge]][[Part 2 First Encounters]]they encountered and affiliate ship of the black scourge because otherwise they would have met one of the main villains of the campaign a bit to early.

They impersonated the [[Red Herrings]] a group of pirates that Patricia knew from here background as a (former) pirate. 

that resulted in the pirates dueling them for all their valuables which they won when they killed the other pirate captain.

then they took this loot: 
### **1. Gold and Currency**

- **Treasure Chest of Mixed Coin**: 800 gold pieces, 250 silver pieces, and a small pouch containing 12 platinum pieces. The chest is lined with 5 black pearls that have tracking magic on them as decoration, a grotesque signature of [[The Black Scourge]]
- **Jewelry and Trinkets**:
    - A pearl necklace (worth 200 gp), still faintly smelling of the sea.
    - A pair of gold earrings shaped like fish hooks (worth 50 gp).
    - A tarnished silver ring set with a polished herring scale (worth 75 gp).
    - A small, finely made pocket watch engraved with the name "Captain Finnegan" (worth 150 gp).

### **2. Nautical Equipment**

- **Masterwork Spyglass**: This beautifully crafted spyglass, found in the captain’s quarters, grants +1 to Perception checks when used to spot distant ships or objects (worth 500 gp).
- **Navigational Charts**: A collection of sea charts marked with secret smuggling routes and pirate hideouts, some of which lead to dangerous waters controlled by monstrous creatures. These charts could provide valuable intel or lead to future adventures.
- **The Dead Man’s Compass**: A cursed compass that never points north. Instead, it always points toward the nearest graveyard of ships or a hidden treasure location tied to tragic pirate lore. If used without proper precautions, the compass can lead its user into deadly traps.

They then figured out that the pearls have tracking magic so they bartered with the captain of [[Elowen's Ship The Sea Serpent|The Sea Serpent]] to take them to a fence she knew in [[Gundarlun]] as long as she got 30% of the proceeds which she then did.

they got a good total of 1000 gp for that of which they got to keep 700gp.

then they went on their way again to figure continue the rest of the session.


They also found a first clue to the [[Side Quest Brothers Apart]] he was transported on a trime a sort of gally to the island of [[Ruathym]] as a gladiator.
