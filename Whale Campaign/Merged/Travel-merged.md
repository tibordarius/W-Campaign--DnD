## Ocean Currents Around the Sword Coast


# Ocean Currents Around the Sword Coast

**Tags**: #swordcoast #oceancurrents #geography #navigation #faerun

---

## Introduction
The Sword Coast, located along the western shores of Faerûn, is heavily influenced by its proximity to the Sea of Swords and the Trackless Sea. The oceanic and atmospheric conditions generate a series of currents, influenced by the geography of the Sword Coast, islands, and surrounding underwater topography. Mariners of the Sword Coast are familiar with these currents and use them to navigate trade routes, avoid hazards, and explore the more distant reaches of the Trackless Sea.

---

## Major Ocean Currents

### [[The Western Drift]] (Trackless Sea)
- **Location**: Westernmost portion of the Trackless Sea.
- **Direction**: Moves eastward, driven by prevailing winds from the west.
- **Impact**: Pushes warm waters towards the Moonshae Isles, Mintarn, and Ruathym, aiding eastward travel.
- **Note**: Often used for faster eastward journeys toward the Sword Coast.

---

### [[The Sword Current]]
- **Location**: Off the western shores of Waterdeep and parallel to the Sword Coast.
- **Direction**: Flows southward.
- **Impact**: Aids trade ships from Luskan, Waterdeep, and further north heading towards Baldur’s Gate and Amn.
- **Note**: A vital current for coastal trade, but creates dangerous waves near cliffs.

---

### [[The Luskan Gyre]]
- **Location**: North of Luskan, near the Ice Peak and Ruathym.
- **Direction**: Counter-clockwise gyre caused by the mix of cold waters from the Sea of Moving Ice and warmer waters from the Sword Coast.
- **Impact**: Creates dangerous icy waters, especially in winter.
- **Note**: Mariners must beware of icebergs and rough conditions near the northern Sword Coast.

---

### [[The Chionthar Flow]]
- **Location**: Mouth of the Chionthar River, near Baldur’s Gate.
- **Direction**: Outflow of freshwater from the Chionthar River into the Sea of Swords.
- **Impact**: Eases passage for ships leaving Baldur’s Gate.
- **Note**: The undercurrents at the river’s mouth can be hazardous.

---

### [[The Whalebones Current]]
- **Location**: Surrounding the Whalebones archipelago.
- **Direction**: Flows northwest between the islands.
- **Impact**: Difficult to navigate against, often pulls ships toward the open Trackless Sea.
- **Note**: Pirates often exploit this current for quick escapes.

---

### [[The Calishite Drift]]
- **Location**: Southern Sword Coast, near Amn and the Calim Desert.
- **Direction**: Flows southward along the coast.
- **Impact**: Warm, calm waters favor trade routes, bringing tropical species and aiding fisheries.
- **Note**: Often used for reliable southbound trade.

---

## Dangerous Currents

### [[The Maelstrom of Nelanther]]
- **Location**: Southwest of the Nelanther Isles, near volcanic vents.
- **Direction**: Sporadic whirlpools form near volcanic activity.
- **Impact**: Ships can be trapped by sudden whirlpools. Legends tell of fleets lost to these waters.
- **Note**: Avoided by most mariners, but pirates sometimes use the maelstrom to their advantage.

---

### [[Tethyr Vortex]]
- **Location**: Southwest coast of Tethyr.
- **Direction**: Counter-clockwise swirling caused by underwater geography.
- **Impact**: Hazardous for small ships; often leads to shipwrecks near underwater rocks.
- **Note**: Mariners avoid this vortex, especially during storms.

---

## Conclusion
Understanding the currents of the Sword Coast is essential for successful navigation along these treacherous waters. Many cities along the coast rely on these currents for trade, exploration, and prosperity. While some currents offer safe and efficient passage, others, like the Maelstrom of Nelanther and the Tethyr Vortex, pose significant risks to those unfamiliar with their paths.

## Pointy Hat Traveling Event System


## [[Introduction Frostlight Awakening]]

Welcome to the Traveling Event System! This system aims to create exciting and dramatic travel scenarios while minimizing tedious mechanics like tracking specific distances or food rationing. It focuses on making travel exciting and story-driven rather than realistic.

---

## [[Distance]]

The system measures distance in terms of events rather than miles or kilometers. The further the distance, the more events the party will encounter. Distances are divided into three categories:

- **Close**
- **Far**
- **Very Far**

The Game Master decides the number of events based on the distance. For example:

- Close: 1 event
- Far: 2 events
- Very Far: 3 events

These numbers can be adjusted for storytelling purposes.

---

## [[Events]]

Events are the core of the Traveling Event System and are categorized into three main types:

- **[[Red - Combat Events]]**: Combat scenarios that can be story-relevant, showcasing the flora and fauna or picking up the pace after roleplaying.
- **[[Blue - Roleplay Events]]**: Roleplaying scenarios that introduce new NPCs or negotiations, sometimes reflecting cultural differences and worldbuilding elements.
- **[[Yellow - Exploration Events]]**: Exploration scenarios that highlight the environment and make it a tangible obstacle or discovery for the players to interact with.

Additionally, there are **[[Combo Events]]**, which mix two or more event types.

---

## [[Combat Events]]

Combat events allow the GM to create story-relevant encounters while traveling. These can feature monsters, antagonists, or rivals that challenge the party.

### Examples:

- The antagonist challenges the party to a duel to assess their strength.
- A spy for the main villain must be stopped before they report the party's location.

---

## [[Roleplay Events]]

Roleplay events introduce NPCs, negotiations, or culturally significant moments that test the party’s social or diplomatic skills.

### Examples:

- The party meets a rival group with similar goals, sparking a rivalry.
- They are invited to tea by a powerful noble during a traveling procession.

---

## [[Exploration Events]]

Exploration events highlight the landscape and natural or magical features, providing challenges beyond combat and diplomacy.

### Examples:

- A rickety bridge over a chasm stands in their way.
- An ancient sea parting spell fades, exposing travelers to dangerous waters and monsters.

---

## [[Combo Events]]

Some events can combine multiple aspects, adding complexity to encounters. These include mixtures of combat, roleplay, and exploration.

### Examples:

- **Purple Event (Roleplay and Combat)**: A hag offers the party a deal to avoid a fight, but combat might still occur.
- **Orange Event (Combat and Exploration)**: The party explores a manor while fighting off nefarious spirits tied to cursed objects.

---

## [[Summary]]

The Traveling Event System (TES) is designed to provide exciting, story-driven travel by focusing on key events rather than the minutiae of travel logistics. It allows GMs to craft meaningful encounters and tailor travel experiences to their campaigns.

## Storm Surges


# Storm Surges

**Tags**: #oceancurrents #stormsurges #navigation #swordcoast #weatherhazards

---

## Overview
**Storm Surges** are sudden and dramatic rises in sea level caused by intense storms, usually tropical cyclones, hurricanes, or severe coastal storms. Along the Sword Coast, these surges are feared by sailors, traders, and coastal inhabitants alike, as they can lead to devastating flooding, shipwrecks, and significant disruption of maritime travel. These surges are particularly dangerous when they combine with high tides or occur near coastal cities such as [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Waterdeep]], or [[Luskan]].

---

## Location
- **Region**: Coastal areas of the Sword Coast, particularly near major port cities like Baldur’s Gate, Waterdeep, and Amn.
- **Key Areas**: Coastal regions near river mouths (e.g., the [[Chionthar Flow]]), low-lying areas, and narrow bays that funnel surges inland.
- **Direction**: Storm surges move inland, driven by high winds and low atmospheric pressure associated with storms.

---

## Characteristics
- **Strength**: The strength of a storm surge depends on the severity of the storm and the shape of the coastline. Low-lying coastal areas and bays are particularly vulnerable to higher storm surges.
- **Height**: Surges can range from a few feet to over 20 feet in extreme storms, causing widespread flooding and damage.
- **Timing**: Surges are most dangerous when they coincide with high tides, leading to much higher water levels than normal.
- **Influence**: Along the Sword Coast, storm surges disrupt trade, maritime travel, and fishing, while also posing significant risks to coastal cities and towns.

---

## Impact on Navigation

Storm surges are a major concern for sailors and port authorities along the Sword Coast. Their sudden onset and immense power can easily overwhelm unprepared ships or port defenses.

- **Flooding and Coastal Erosion**: Surges can flood docks, ports, and coastal cities, causing massive structural damage and disrupting trade. Coastal erosion also worsens during surges, wearing away at important infrastructure.
- **Port Closures**: Ports in cities like [[Waterdeep]] and [[Baldur’s Gate]] may be closed in anticipation of surges, leading to delays in trade and travel.
- **Shipwrecks**: Ships caught in the open sea during a storm surge face a high risk of being overwhelmed by the massive waves, leading to wrecks along the coast or out at sea.
- **Impact on River Mouths**: Areas near river mouths, such as the [[Chionthar Flow]] near Baldur's Gate, are particularly vulnerable to storm surges as the surge can push river water back upstream, leading to inland flooding.

---

## Associated Regions

The Luskan Gyre is widely regarded as a dangerous obstacle for sailors and is generally avoided by all but the most experienced navigators. Those who must travel northward towards the Sea of Moving Ice or Ice Peak must be exceptionally cautious.

- **Dangerous Waters**: The gyre’s pull is particularly hazardous for smaller vessels or those already off course due to storms or poor navigation.
- **Icebergs**: In winter, the gyre collects icebergs drifting down from the Sea of Moving Ice, increasing the likelihood of collisions for any ship caught in the current.
- **Cold Waters**: Ships navigating the Luskan Gyre must also contend with freezing temperatures, which can cause rapid damage to a ship’s hull, rigging, and crew.

---

## Associated Regions

### [[Luskan]]
**Luskan** lies to the south of the gyre. While the city thrives on maritime trade, most captains avoid traveling too far north due to the dangers posed by the swirling current and cold waters.

### [[Ice Peak]]
The **Ice Peak** lies close to the northern edge of the gyre. Ships seeking to trade with settlements near the Ice Peak or travel towards the Sea of Moving Ice must be wary of the gyre’s pull, which can lead them off course.

### [[Ruathym]]
Further west lies **Ruathym**, an island whose inhabitants are skilled sailors. However, even they approach the Luskan Gyre with caution, understanding the dangers it presents.

---

## Related Dangers

### [[Sea of Moving Ice]]
The **Sea of Moving Ice** is a constant source of icebergs that feed into the Luskan Gyre. During the colder months, these icebergs become trapped in the swirling waters, making the gyre even more dangerous for ships venturing near.

### [[Icebergs and Floes]]
Icebergs carried by the Sea of Moving Ice can be pulled into the gyre, creating a hazard for any ships caught in the swirling waters. These icebergs are particularly dangerous in winter when the current is at its strongest.

---

## Conclusion
The Luskan Gyre is one of the most feared ocean currents in the northern Sword Coast region. Its cold, swirling waters, along with the danger posed by icebergs, make it a treacherous obstacle for any ships venturing too far north of Luskan. Mariners avoid it when possible, but those seeking to explore the Ice Peak or trade in the northern waters must always be prepared for its dangers.

## The Sword Current


# The Sword Current

**Tags**: #oceancurrents #swordcoast #navigation #trade 

---

## Overview
The **Sword Current** is a strong ocean current running parallel to the Sword Coast, flowing from the northern reaches near [[Luskan]] and [[Waterdeep]] down toward [[Baldur's Gate]] and beyond. It serves as one of the most critical currents for trade and travel along the western coast of Faerûn, helping ships traverse the long coastlines more quickly.

---

## Location
- **Region**: Parallel to the western shores of Faerûn, from the Sea of Swords near Luskan, down along the Sword Coast.
- **Adjacent Areas**: Waterdeep, Baldur’s Gate, Amn.
- **Direction**: Southward, flowing steadily along the Sword Coast.

---

## Characteristics
- **Current Speed**: Moderate to fast, with increased speeds near coastal cliffs and open waters.
- **Temperature**: Mild, influenced by the warm coastal waters.
- **Seasonal Variability**: Generally consistent, though storms, especially near Waterdeep, can increase its speed or shift its course temporarily.
- **Influence**: The Sword Current aids in southbound trade, ensuring faster voyages for ships traveling between cities such as Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate.

---

## Impact on Navigation

The Sword Current is a well-known and widely used current by sailors and merchants along the Sword Coast. It significantly reduces travel time for vessels sailing south from northern cities like Luskan and Waterdeep.

- **Southward Travel**: The southward flow of the Sword Current is a boon for ships headed toward Baldur’s Gate, Amn, and ports even further south. Ships can travel more quickly and expend fewer resources.
- **Challenges**: While the current provides a great advantage, coastal cliffs, particularly near Waterdeep, can cause dangerous waves and rocky conditions for smaller ships.
- **Pirate Activity**: Pirates from the [[Nelanther Isles]] and the [[Whalebones Current]] sometimes use the Sword Current to ambush ships, especially when storms have shifted the current closer to the coast.

---

## Associated Regions

### [[Luskan]]
As the northernmost major city benefiting from the Sword Current, Luskan sends ships southward, with many traveling to Waterdeep, Baldur’s Gate, or further afield. Luskan's sailors are some of the most experienced at using the Sword Current for long-distance voyages.

### [[Waterdeep]]
The Jewel of the North, **Waterdeep**, sees heavy maritime traffic, much of which depends on the Sword Current to reach southern ports. Waterdeep’s trade is vital for the economic flow along the Sword Coast, making the current a crucial part of its success.

### [[Baldur’s Gate]]
Further south, **Baldur’s Gate** is a key recipient of goods shipped via the Sword Current. The city’s economy thrives on the predictable southward flow of ships bringing goods, news, and travelers from the north.

### [[Amn]]
South of Baldur’s Gate, **Amn** relies heavily on the Sword Current for its trade routes, as it allows fast and steady travel between the southern regions and the Sword Coast’s northern powerhouses.

---

## Related Dangers

While the Sword Current is a major boon for trade, it can also present hazards:

### [[The Nelanther Isles]]
- Located west of the Sword Coast, the **Nelanther Isles** are home to notorious pirates who sometimes use the Sword Current to ambush unprepared ships. The swift current makes it easier for them to board or sink vessels quickly.

### [[The Maelstrom of Nelanther]]
- This dangerous whirlpool lies further south and is a constant threat to ships using the Sword Current, particularly during stormy seasons when the current's flow may shift closer to the maelstrom.

---

## Conclusion
The Sword Current is a lifeline for the Sword Coast’s maritime trade, providing a reliable southward flow that allows for faster travel, increased trade, and the success of major cities like Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate. However, its power is a double-edged sword, as pirates and natural hazards also make this a dangerous path for the unwary.

---

## Impact on Navigation
The Western Drift is well-known to sailors who regularly traverse the Trackless Sea. Ships setting out from islands like Mintarn and the Moonshaes frequently use this current to speed their journey towards Faerûn’s western coast.

- **Eastward Travel**: The drift’s reliable direction towards the east makes it a preferred current for those heading to major cities like [[Waterdeep]], [[Baldur’s Gate]], and [[Neverwinter]].
- **Challenges**: Sudden storms on the Trackless Sea can push ships off course, especially when coupled with the strong forces of the Western Drift.
- **Trade Routes**: Merchants use this current to ferry goods from distant islands and the Moonshaes to the Sword Coast, cutting down on travel time and fuel expenditure.

---

## Associated Regions

### [[Moonshae Isles]]
The **Moonshae Isles** are the first major landmass affected by the Western Drift. The Isles’ location makes them a key stopover for ships riding the Drift toward Faerûn.

### [[Mintarn]]
The island of **Mintarn** lies along the route of the Western Drift, and many ships set off from here to take advantage of the current’s eastward pull.

## Related Dangers

While the Western Drift offers reliable and swift travel, it is not without risks:

### [[The Maelstrom of Nelanther]]
- Located to the south, this dangerous maelstrom can trap vessels sailing too far off course when following the Drift. Sailors must stay vigilant to avoid being pulled into its treacherous waters.

### [[The Luskan Gyre]]
- Ships venturing too far north from the Western Drift may be caught in the cold, dangerous whirlpools of the Luskan Gyre. This is particularly hazardous for ships attempting to avoid storms by veering northward.

---

## Conclusion
The Western Drift remains an essential route for those navigating the Trackless Sea, providing a swift eastward current that aids trade, exploration, and maritime travel toward the Sword Coast. However, like any ocean current, it requires knowledge and experience to navigate safely, avoiding the potential hazards that lie along its path.

# The Whalebones Current

**Tags**: #oceancurrents #navigation #swordcoast #whalebones #dangerouswaters

---

## Overview
The **Whalebones Current** is a strong and treacherous ocean current that flows through and around the [[Whalebones Isles]], a remote and rugged archipelago in the [[Trackless Sea]] west of the Sword Coast. Known for its unpredictable strength and direction, this current has both aided and endangered ships for centuries, especially those venturing between the Whalebones and the Sword Coast. While it can provide a swift passage for experienced sailors, it is also notorious for pulling ships off course, toward dangerous reefs or deep into the Trackless Sea.

---

## Location
- **Region**: Surrounding and flowing through the [[Whalebones Isles]] in the Trackless Sea.
- **Adjacent Areas**: Trackless Sea, Moonshae Isles, Nelanther Isles.
- **Direction**: Primarily flows northwest, but the direction can vary depending on season and weather.

---

## Characteristics
- **Current Speed**: Varies from moderate to strong, especially near the narrow passages between the islands.
- **Water Type**: Cold waters from the deeper parts of the Trackless Sea mix with warmer coastal waters, making the current highly unpredictable.
- **Seasonal Variability**: The current strengthens during storms and in the winter months, making the waters around the Whalebones extremely dangerous.
- **Influence**: Ships can be pushed off course toward hidden reefs, rocky shores, or deeper into the uncharted waters of the Trackless Sea. However, experienced captains use the current for fast travel through the region.

---

## Impact on Navigation

The Whalebones Current is both a boon and a bane to mariners in the region. Its fast-moving waters provide rapid travel for those familiar with its shifting flows, but it can easily trap inexperienced sailors or those caught unaware by storms.

- **Rapid Travel**: Ships traveling northwest can make swift progress by riding the current, saving time and resources. However, staying on course requires precise navigation, as the current can shift suddenly.
- **Hazardous Waters**: The reefs and hidden rocks around the Whalebones Isles make the current perilous, especially for ships venturing too close to the isles during rough seas. Ships lost to these waters are often pulled further into the Trackless Sea, where rescue is difficult.
- **Pirate Activity**: Pirates from the nearby [[Nelanther Isles]] and other rogue factions are known to exploit the current for ambushes, using its fast flow to pursue or escape from ships. The islands’ remoteness and the danger of the current make it a prime area for pirate hideouts.

---

## Associated Regions

### [[Moonshae Isles]]
To the northeast, the **Moonshae Isles** lie just beyond the reach of the Whalebones Current. Ships heading to or from the Moonshaes often skirt the edge of the current to avoid the worst of its dangers.

### [[The Nelanther Isles|Nelanther Isles]]
**Pirates from the Nelanther Isles** occasionally use the Whalebones Current to stage attacks on unsuspecting vessels. The current provides them with a quick escape route, making it difficult for law enforcement or merchant ships to pursue them effectively.

---

## Related Dangers

### [[Hidden Reefs]]
The waters around the **Whalebones Isles** are littered with **hidden reefs**, many of which are invisible until a ship is nearly on top of them. Ships caught in the current may be pulled into these reefs, resulting in wrecks.

### [[Storm Surges]]
During storms, the Whalebones Current becomes especially deadly as **storm surges** amplify its power, pushing ships dangerously close to the islands and increasing the likelihood of wrecks along the rocky shores.

---

## Conclusion
The Whalebones Current is a vital yet dangerous waterway for sailors navigating the Trackless Sea. While experienced navigators can use the current to shorten their travel time, its unpredictable nature and the dangers posed by the surrounding reefs and islands make it a perilous route. Those sailing through these waters must be prepared for sudden shifts in the current, especially during storms or when near the Whalebones Isles.

## Underwater Currents


# Underwater Currents

**Tags**: #oceancurrents #underwatercurrents #navigation #swordcoast #dangerouswaters

---

## Overview
**Underwater Currents** are a hidden yet powerful force beneath the surface of the Sword Coast’s waters. These currents, created by the interaction of freshwater rivers, oceanic currents, and underwater geological formations, can pose significant risks to sailors, fishermen, and adventurers alike. While often invisible from the surface, they can drastically affect a ship's course and stability, and in some cases, drag smaller vessels off course or even to their doom.

---

## Location
- **Region**: Throughout the waters of the Sword Coast and particularly prominent near river mouths, coastal cliffs, and areas of significant geological activity.
- **Key Areas**: The mouth of the [[Chionthar River]], the [[Nelanther Isles]], and the waters surrounding the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] are particularly known for dangerous underwater currents.
- **Direction**: Varies depending on the region, often unpredictable due to the mixing of freshwater and saltwater or the presence of submerged structures.

---

## Characteristics
- **Strength**: Underwater currents vary in strength, from mild currents that slowly shift a ship’s course to powerful undertows capable of dragging vessels off balance or even pulling them beneath the waves.
- **Temperature**: Often colder than surface currents, especially in the northern regions near [[Luskan]] and the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].
- **Seasonal Variability**: Underwater currents can become more intense during the winter months, or during periods of heavy rainfall that increase the flow of freshwater into the sea. They are also affected by tidal movements and storm surges.
- **Influence**: These currents are often difficult to detect without magical assistance or specialized equipment, making them a hidden danger for unwary sailors.

---

## Impact on Navigation

Underwater currents can significantly affect the movement of ships, especially those unfamiliar with the waters of the Sword Coast. For experienced sailors, understanding the presence of these currents is key to avoiding accidents and navigating efficiently.

- **Hidden Dangers**: Since underwater currents are often invisible from the surface, they present a significant challenge for even experienced navigators. They can drag ships off course or into dangerous waters, such as rocky shores or whirlpools.
- **Areas of High Risk**: River mouths like the [[Chionthar Flow]] create strong underwater currents where freshwater and saltwater meet. Similarly, areas with steep underwater drop-offs or submerged volcanic activity, such as around the [[Nelanther Isles]], are known for their powerful underwater currents.
- **Mariner’s Tools**: Some experienced mariners use special magical or technological devices to detect these currents before they become a problem, though most smaller vessels rely on local knowledge and good fortune.

---

## Associated Regions

### [[Chionthar Flow]]
The mixing of freshwater from the [[Chionthar River]] and the saltwater of the Sea of Swords creates unpredictable **underwater currents** at the river’s mouth. Ships navigating in and out of [[Baldur’s Gate]] must be cautious of these hidden forces, especially during stormy weather.

### [[Nelanther Isles]]
The waters around the **Nelanther Isles** are infamous for strong underwater currents caused by submerged geological formations and volcanic activity. These currents often trap unwary ships, dragging them towards dangerous maelstroms or rocky reefs.

### [[Sea of Moving Ice]]
In the northern regions, the **Sea of Moving Ice** presents a unique danger, as massive icebergs create powerful underwater currents. As the ice shifts, so too do the currents, creating hazards for ships exploring these frozen waters or venturing towards the [[Luskan Gyre]].

---

## Related Dangers

### [[Whirlpools and Maelstroms]]
In areas like the [[Maelstrom of Nelanther]], underwater currents combine with surface whirlpools, creating deadly traps for ships. These natural phenomena can quickly drag even larger vessels beneath the surface.

### [[Tidal Surges]]
Underwater currents can become particularly dangerous during **tidal surges**, when strong tides intensify the force of underwater movements. These surges can pull ships toward underwater hazards or cause sudden, unexpected shifts in direction.

---

## Conclusion
Underwater currents are an often-overlooked but deadly element of the Sword Coast’s maritime environment. While difficult to detect, their influence on navigation and ship safety is profound, making it essential for sailors to be aware of areas where these hidden forces are strongest. Understanding the nature of underwater currents can mean the difference between a safe journey and disaster on the open sea.
