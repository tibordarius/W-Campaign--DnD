## Choosing the Path

# **Choosing the Path**

## **Introduction**

The treasure hunt is not a straight course across the seas—it is a web of decisions, alliances, and betrayals. The players must decide how they will secure the relics and navigate the treacherous waters of power, diplomacy, and conflict. Each approach they take will shape the relationships they forge and the enemies they make.

---

## **Approaching the Hunt**

### **The Path of Cunning – Stealth & Espionage**

For those who prefer subtlety over brute force, stealth and deception provide an effective means to obtain the relics.

- **Infiltrating the Royal Navy's Archives**: A daring heist to retrieve the relic from the heavily fortified naval base.
- **Sabotaging Pirate Alliances**: Disrupting rival pirate factions to make their relic easier to claim.
- **Forging False Identities**: Posing as scholars, traders, or emissaries to gain access to hidden knowledge.

### **The Path of Words – Negotiation & Diplomacy**

Some factions may be persuaded to willingly part with their relics if the right leverage is applied.

- **Bargaining with the Order of Oceanic Scholars**: Convincing them that the relic must be moved for protection.
- **Striking a Deal with the Pirate Alliance**: Earning the favor of a pirate lord in exchange for their prize.
- **Offering Services to the Whale Society**: Proving one's worth to gain their trust and knowledge.

### **The Path of Might – Combat & Conquest**

For those who prefer direct confrontation, strength of arms may be the quickest solution.

- **Storming the Abyssal Cult’s Hidden Temple**: A full-scale battle against eldritch horrors and devoted zealots.
- **Naval Warfare Against the Royal Navy**: A high-stakes siege on their stronghold to claim the relic by force.
- **Challenging the Pirate Lords**: A duel to the death for leadership over the relic’s fate.

---

## **[[Travel Encounters]]**

As the players sail between key locations, they will encounter dangers and opportunities on the high seas. These encounters will test their skills, provide valuable information, or introduce new factions into their journey.

### **Naval Skirmishes**

- **Ambushed by Cult Raiders**: The Abyssal Cult sends warships to eliminate those meddling in their plans.
- **Pirate Blockades**: Ruthless pirates demand tribute to allow safe passage—or challenge the players to a high-stakes duel.
- **A Ghost Ship Drifts in the Fog**: A seemingly abandoned vessel hides a dangerous secret within its depths.

### **Trade Agreements & Diplomacy**

- **Negotiating with a Merchant Prince**: A powerful trader offers supplies and information—for a price.
- **A Hidden Smuggler’s Cove**: A criminal syndicate offers an illicit shortcut through dangerous waters.
- **The Toll of the Leviathan Cult**: A fanatical sect demands a tribute in blood to appease their deep-sea god.

### **Espionage & Subterfuge**

- **Intercepting a Secret Message**: A cryptic letter between two factions reveals vital intelligence.
- **A Spy in the Crew**: A double agent attempts to sabotage the party’s journey.
- **The Disguised Assassin**: A foreign envoy may not be who they claim to be.

---

## **Conclusion**

Every decision the players make will shape their path and the alliances they form. Whether through subterfuge, diplomacy, or war, the relics will not be easily won. Choosing the right approach for each challenge will determine whether they rise as legends of the sea—or are swallowed by its depths.

## The Call to Adventure


# **The Call to Adventure**

## **Introduction to the Treasure Map Relics**

The seas whisper of a treasure lost to time, its location split among four ancient relics. Each artifact is a key, its inscription revealing a portion of the map to the legendary hoard. But these relics are not forgotten trinkets—they are held by powerful factions who guard them zealously, each with their own reasons for keeping them hidden.

To claim the treasure, the party must navigate the shifting tides of power, deception, and adventure. They may find themselves forging uneasy alliances with treacherous pirate captains, infiltrating guarded strongholds under false pretenses, or unraveling a web of lies spun by those who seek the relics for their own hidden agendas. Only those bold enough to challenge the dangers of the high seas and the treachery of factions vying for dominance will uncover the truth behind the treasure’s final resting place.

## **Who Holds the Relics?**

The relics are spread across the world, safeguarded by organizations that wield significant influence over the seas. Each faction has its own motivations, and the party must decide whether to negotiate, steal, or battle their way to victory.

### **[[The Abyssal Cult]]**

A shadowy cabal devoted to awakening an ancient oceanic horror. The cult believes the treasure holds the final key to breaking the chains of their slumbering god. They will stop at nothing to secure all four relics and bring forth the abyssal apocalypse.

#### **Encounter: Ritual of the Deep**

- **Location:** A hidden underwater temple, deep within a volcanic trench.
- **Objective:** Interrupt a dark summoning ritual before the cult completes it.
- **Challenges:** Powerful cultists, abyssal creatures, and the risk of collapsing tunnels.
- **Possible Rewards:** Clues to the location of the relic and an ancient tome of forbidden oceanic magic.

### **[[The Pirate Alliance]]**

A council of freebooters, privateers, and cutthroats who have hidden one relic deep within their dominion. They see it as a bargaining chip, a weapon to control the seas and cement their rule over the lawless waters. Their willingness to part with it depends on whether the party proves themselves valuable allies—or threats.

#### **Location: The Floating City of Blackwake**

- A vast, lawless flotilla of repurposed warships and pirate strongholds.
- Governed by the unpredictable Pirate Lords, each with their own ambitions.
- The relic is hidden in the personal vault of Captain Veyna "Bloodtide" Dorne.

### **[[The Royal Navy]]**

Guardians of the law, order, and trade routes, the Royal Navy has sealed one relic within the fortified walls of their grand citadel. They consider it a national treasure, an artifact too important to fall into the hands of pirates, thieves, or scholars who would meddle with forces beyond their understanding.

#### **Encounter: The Naval Siege**

- **Location:** The heavily fortified naval bastion of Fort Stormguard.
- **Objective:** Infiltrate the citadel to recover the relic.
- **Challenges:** Elite royal guards, magical defenses, and high-ranking officers with their own motives.
- **Possible Rewards:** Naval intelligence, secret escape routes, and access to restricted maritime archives.

### **[[The Order of Oceanic Scholars (OOS)]]**

The OOS believes knowledge must be preserved, but some knowledge must never be unleashed. Their relic lies buried in an archive that only the most trusted scholars can access, protected by ancient arcane seals, shifting labyrinthine corridors, and automated guardians crafted from enchanted coral and deep-sea metals. Their reasoning is simple: some secrets are too dangerous for the world, and this relic is one of them.

#### **Location: The Grand Archives of Mysthaven**

- A sprawling labyrinth of submerged vaults, arcane seals, and automated defenses.
- The OOS hides the relic in the deepest chambers, accessible only through intricate puzzles and trials.
- The scholars will not yield the relic without irrefutable proof that it is needed for the greater good.

### **[[The Whale Society]]**

A society of sages, navigators, and historians dedicated to preserving the oldest secrets of the sea. The Whale Society safeguards the final relic, believing it holds the last tether to an ancient catastrophe. They will not part with it unless convinced that those who seek it can prevent history from repeating itself.

#### **Encounter: The Sunken Library**

- **Location:** A lost city submerged beneath the Iceflow Abyss.
- **Objective:** Earn the Whale Society’s trust by retrieving ancient records before they are lost forever.
- **Challenges:** Hostile deep-sea predators, abyssal currents, and rival scholars racing to claim the same knowledge.
- **Possible Rewards:** Access to secret historical texts and clues to unlocking the relic’s true power.

## **The Beginning of the Hunt**

The journey begins when the party stumbles upon the first clue—perhaps an aged map fragment, the dying words of a sailor, or an intercepted letter detailing the relics’ existence. From there, they must decide where to begin their hunt, charting a course that will lead them into the heart of factional conflicts, dangerous seas, and long-forgotten ruins.

The path to the treasure is fraught with peril. The Abyssal Cult watches from the shadows, pirates test their mettle, and the forces of law and scholarship guard their secrets well. Only by outmaneuvering their rivals and forging (or breaking) alliances will the party piece together the map and claim their prize.

Let the Great Treasure Hunt begin!

## The Great Treasure Hunt Campaign


# The Great Treasure Hunt Campaign

## Introduction

In a world of endless seas, untamed islands, and warring factions, a legendary treasure lies hidden, waiting to be claimed. To find it, one must decipher the secrets of four ancient relics, each containing a piece of the map leading to the final destination. But the relics are not just objects to be discovered—they are held by powerful rulers, guarded in dangerous dungeons, or lost to the depths of the sea.

The treasure hunt will take players across the oceans, forcing them to navigate treacherous waters, outwit cunning enemies, and forge fragile alliances, all while piecing together the puzzle that will lead them to untold riches.

---

## **I. The Call to Adventure**

### **How the Players First Learn of the Hunt**

The players’ journey begins in an unassuming port town, where they overhear fragmented rumors about a hidden treasure of unfathomable value. Old sailors whisper of lost maps, ancient keys, and a secret war being fought beneath the waves. As they explore further, they notice a pattern—mentions of an enigmatic group known as **The Abyssal Cult**, though few dare to speak of it openly.

Their first concrete clue comes in the form of a desperate scholar, **Marcellus Vaine**, a rogue member of the **[[Whale Society]]** who has been exiled for uncovering forbidden knowledge. He carries with him a tattered, sea-stained journal detailing his research into the **four relics**, revealing that the Whale Society has hidden one away in their archives, fearing it may be too dangerous to be wielded.

**[[Encounter: The Shadows at the Dock]]**

As Marcellus attempts to explain, he is suddenly set upon by cloaked figures moving with eerie precision. Shadows stretch unnaturally around them as they glide through the docks, their whispers carried on the salty wind like an ominous chant. The scholar stumbles forward, desperation in his eyes, as he hurls his journal toward the players.

### **Combat Encounter: Cultist Pursuit**

**Enemies:** 3-5 Abyssal Cult Acolytes (CR 1/2) and 1 Abyssal Cult Shadowblade (CR 2)

- **Opening Phase:** As soon as Marcellus throws the journal, the cultists shift their focus to the players. The Shadowblade snarls, "They have the writings! Do not let them escape!"
- **Tactics:** The cultists attempt to corner the party, using shadow magic and terrain to block escape routes.
- **Complications:** A heavy storm is brewing, causing slippery terrain and poor visibility. The docks are lined with crates, ropes, and moored ships that can be used creatively for cover or escape.
- **Victory Conditions:** If the players defeat or evade the cultists, Marcellus—wounded but alive—urges them to flee with the journal. If he is captured, his final cry echoes through the night, forcing the players to track him down before he is sacrificed.

### **Alternate Solutions:**

- **Stealth Option:** If the players choose to hide instead of fight, they can roll group Stealth (DC 14) to slip into the shadows as the cultists chase a decoy.
- **Social Option:** A successful Persuasion (DC 16) check might cause a hesitant cultist to falter, revealing crucial hints about their mission before the Shadowblade silences them.

This encounter serves as the players' first direct conflict with the Abyssal Cult and establishes them as a target in the greater conspiracy.

As the players investigate, they begin to notice deeper signs of **Abyssal Cult infiltration**. Merchant ships have vanished under mysterious circumstances, coastal villages have begun to worship unknown sea deities, and certain pirate crews whisper of unnatural storms that always seem to work in the cult's favor. Slowly, the reality dawns on them—the cult is not just seeking the relics, they are manipulating the very balance of the ocean to weaken the barriers keeping something monstrous sealed away.

This subtle introduction places the players at the heart of a growing mystery—one that hints at the **Abyssal Cult’s** hidden influence and the Whale Society’s desperate attempts to keep their relic safe.

## The Specialized Ship Heist


# **The Specialized Ship Heist**

## **Introduction**

The treasure map’s final location is beyond normal reach, hidden in a region of the sea where conventional ships cannot venture. Legends tell of a lost civilization that once guarded the site, its ruins now scattered across the ocean floor, protected by powerful magical wards and sea-born monstrosities. Unnatural storms, treacherous reefs, and mysterious magical disturbances guard the path, rendering most vessels useless. To reach this legendary destination, the players must secure a specialized ship—one capable of withstanding these extreme conditions and navigating the uncharted waters beyond the known world.

This heist is no simple task. The ship they seek is a prize that many factions desire, and obtaining it will require cunning, alliances, and perhaps a bit of treachery. The players must navigate a world of intrigue, where every faction has a vested interest in who ultimately wields this mighty vessel. Will they steal it from under the nose of a powerful navy, win it through a high-stakes challenge, or barter with influential figures to secure it?

## **Types of Specialized Ships**

### **[[The Leviathan’s Wake]] (Submarine)**

- A deep-diving vessel constructed by dwarven engineers and enchanted by sea elf sorcerers.
- Hidden in the depths of a **Sunken Vault**, guarded by ancient water elementals and lost technologies of an underwater empire.
- Ideal for navigating trenches, avoiding surface patrols, and uncovering deep-sea mysteries. It may also have secrets of its own, whispering echoes of its creators’ past.

### **[[The Skyfury]] (Airship)**

- A flying galleon built with a fusion of arcane propulsion and elemental air magic, originally crafted by the high arcanists of Halruaa and later seized by the Royal Navy for its strategic value.
- Currently docked in **Neverwinter**, held in a Royal Navy facility under the command of a ruthless admiral who suspects treachery at every turn.
- Perfect for bypassing naval blockades and reaching floating islands or skybound fortresses, though its stolen nature may make it a constant target.

### **[[The Starborn Voyager]] (Spelljammer)**

- An astral ship capable of navigating between dimensions and bypassing even the most arcane defenses.
- Hidden in an abandoned **Astral Shipyard**, accessible only through a forgotten planar rift guarded by sentient starbeasts and rogue navigators.
- Grants unparalleled maneuverability and the ability to evade even the most persistent pursuers, but requires a captain attuned to the cosmos to pilot it effectively.

## **Approaches to Securing the Ship**

### **1. The Grand Theft Heist**

- The players infiltrate the ship’s guarded location, disable its defenses, and steal it outright.
- Requires careful planning, stealth, and possibly a diversion to escape unnoticed.
- Potential encounters include:
    - Breaking into the Royal Navy’s secure shipyard and impersonating officials.
    - Disabling arcane locks or mechanical traps securing the vessel, some of which may be sentient and resistant to tampering.
    - A high-speed escape under enemy fire, leading to an exhilarating chase sequence.

### **2. The High-Stakes Gamble**

- A powerful faction (pirates, nobles, or an arcane syndicate) owns the ship and offers it as a reward in a high-stakes challenge.
- The players must win a daring contest, such as—though failure may result in alternative opportunities to obtain the ship, or force the players to resort to theft or diplomacy instead:
    - A legendary card game in the floating casinos of **Calimport**, where the stakes are rigged and the dealers may not be human.
    - A high-speed sea race through treacherous waters, where sabotage is not just allowed but expected.
    - A dueling tournament where the winner claims the vessel, but each challenger must bring something of equal worth as an ante.

### **3. The Diplomatic Acquisition**

- Some factions may be willing to trade or loan the ship in exchange for a significant favor. However, failure to negotiate successfully may lead to drastic consequences—an insulted Pirate Lord could declare a vendetta, the Royal Navy might blacklist the players from key ports, or the Order of Oceanic Scholars could place a bounty on them for attempting to steal their secrets.
- Requires negotiation, completing faction-based quests, and possibly betraying an ally.
- Potential deals include:
    - Convincing the **Order of Oceanic Scholars** to part with their experimental vessel by retrieving forbidden knowledge lost to time.
    - Trading valuable relics with an influential **Pirate Lord**, who may demand future services in return.
    - Serving the **Whale Society** in a dangerous mission in exchange for their ship’s location, ensuring their trust isn’t misplaced.

- Will stop at nothing to secure it first, sending spies and saboteurs to disrupt other factions’ attempts.

### **The Royal Navy**

- Believes the ship is too dangerous to be controlled by private hands and must remain under their command.
- Will hunt the players down if they attempt to steal or misuse it, deploying their finest captains to reclaim it.

### **The Pirate Alliance**

- Desires the ship as the ultimate weapon to dominate the seas.
- May ally with or betray the players depending on their approach, particularly if they already hold power in pirate society.

### **The Order of Oceanic Scholars**

- Built one of the specialized ships as part of an experiment.
- Will trade access in return for knowledge or artifacts related to the treasure’s final location, but may demand proof of the players' intent.

## **Side Quests & Additional Challenges**

- **Recovering a Missing Engineer:** The key to operating the vessel is a missing engineer who vanished under mysterious circumstances, possibly abducted by rival factions.
- **Securing the Fuel Source:** Whether elemental crystals, eldritch essence, or a long-lost magical artifact, the ship needs a rare power source, requiring dangerous retrieval missions.
- **Sabotaging a Rival’s Attempt:** Another group is attempting to take control of the ship—players must disrupt their plans first or face them as future adversaries.
- **Ancient Guardian’s Challenge:** Some ships require an ancient trial to prove one’s worth, demanding both wit and strength to claim them as their own.

## **Conclusion**

Securing the specialized ship is a major milestone in the treasure hunt. How the players go about it will influence their standing with various factions and shape the challenges they face in their journey ahead. Will they take it by force, win it through cunning, or forge an uneasy alliance? Each decision will have lasting consequences, shaping future interactions with the factions involved—turning potential allies into foes or securing powerful supporters for the challenges ahead. The choice is theirs, and the fate of the hunt depends on it.

Whether facing storms, rival factions, or the unknown, each encounter presents a chance for adventure and discovery.

## **Types of Travel Encounters**

### **Naval Skirmishes**

- **Abyssal Cult Raiders**: The cult has dispatched warships to intercept those meddling with their plans. Their vessels are reinforced with dark magic, and their crews are zealots willing to sacrifice everything.

### **Natural Hazards and Mystical Phenomena**

The sea is an unpredictable and dangerous place, filled with supernatural forces.

- **The Leviathan’s Maw**: A monstrous whirlpool threatens to pull the ship into the depths. A rumored path exists through it, but only if the party can interpret the clues left by old sailors.
- **The Everstorm**: A perpetual storm rages in an area marked on their charts. Is it a natural phenomenon, or is something fueling it?

The ocean holds ancient secrets, some best left undisturbed.

- **The Singing Depths**: A haunting melody resonates from beneath the waves. Following it could lead to an ancient ruin—or a trap set by deep-sea sirens.
- **A Drifting Beacon**: A floating lantern, eerily untouched by the wind and waves, marks something important. Its presence invites investigation but also draws unwanted attention.
- **The Spirits of the Deep**: The players witness a ghostly reenactment of an ancient naval battle. Intervening or deciphering the scene could reveal hidden knowledge.

### **Espionage and Intrigue at Sea**

Not all threats come from outside the ship—some lurk within.

- **A Stowaway on Board**: A mysterious passenger is discovered in the ship’s hold. Are they an escaped prisoner, a desperate refugee, or a saboteur?
- **A Spy Among the Crew**: One of the crew members is relaying information to an enemy faction. Players must uncover their identity before they strike.
- **A Coded Message**: A floating bottle carries a letter with cryptic warnings or an urgent plea for aid. Deciphering it may set the party on a dangerous but rewarding path.
