The players notice that the crew is excited about something. As they look over the side of the ship, they see a pod of dolphins swimming gracefully alongside the vessel. But these aren't just any dolphins; they have small bags and pouches strapped to their sleek bodies, and their eyes seem to gleam with intelligence.

---

## The Encounter

**Narrator**: 
"To your surprise, the dolphins begin to surface near the ship, one by one, each carrying a small pouch or container in its mouth. The crew begins to lower baskets and ropes over the side, laughing and chatting as they prepare to exchange goods with their aquatic visitors."

**Interaction**: 
The players can observe or join in the trading process, which is treated as a routine occurrence by the crew. The dolphins offer a variety of exotic items and curiosities from the depths of the ocean, in exchange for simple goods such as fruits, shiny objects, or even just a friendly pat on the head.

**Items Available for Trade**:
- **Coral Trinkets**: Beautifully carved pieces of coral, shaped into jewelry or small statues. These are common among the dolphin traders.

- **Luminescent Shells**: Glowing shells that can be used as natural lanterns or in magical rituals.
- **Deep-Sea Fish**: Unusual fish with vibrant colors and bioluminescent patterns, which could be sold in a market or used in alchemical concoctions.

**Skill Checks**:
- **Animal Handling (DC 10)**: Players can attempt to communicate with the dolphins, understanding their needs and desires better. Success results in better trade deals, while failure might cause the dolphins to become wary.
- **Insight (DC 12)**: Players can determine if the dolphins have any hidden intentions or if they are being influenced by an unseen force.
- **Arcana (DC 14)**: A successful check allows a player to recognize any magical properties in the items the dolphins offer, identifying any curses or enchantments.

**Crew Involvement**: 
The crew is fully engaged in the trading, treating the dolphins like old friends. They explain to the players that this pod of dolphins, known as the Silverfin Traders, has been conducting trades with ships in the region for generations. The dolphins are known for their fairness and the occasional ability to bring back goods that no human could ever reach.

**Optional Roleplay**:
- **Crew Member 1**: "Ah, it's good to see the Silverfins again. They always bring the best pearls."
- **Crew Member 2**: "Remember last time when they brought that enchanted conch shell? Still can't believe we got that for just a few apples and a mirror!"

---

## Outcomes

- **Successful Trade**: If the players participate in the trade, they might acquire valuable items or useful curiosities. The dolphins leave with their traded goods, whistling happily as they swim away.
- **Unusual Request**: One of the dolphins, larger and with a scar across its snout, makes a special request by presenting a piece of driftwood with strange carvings on it. If the players accept, they gain a side quest to investigate the origin of the carvings, which could lead to an underwater adventure or a hidden treasure.
- **Mysterious Event**: If the players try to use magic or attempt to deceive the dolphins, they might trigger an unusual event where the dolphins suddenly vanish, leaving behind only the smallest of their offerings—a clue to a deeper mystery beneath the waves.

## Conclusion

## **Introduction**

**Leviathan Lore**, often simply referred to as "Lore," is one of the most ancient and powerful creatures in the world's oceans. Revered by some, feared by others, and sought after by many, **Lore** is not merely a gargantuan whale but a living embodiment of the ocean's mysteries.

## Overview

The **Orca Society** is structured around powerful warlords who lead different clans, each with its own culture, territories, and goals. There is a key distinction between **Territorial Orcas**, who defend their realms with an iron fist, and **Intercontinental Orcas**, expansionist warlords with ambitions of conquest over the seas and beyond. These factions often come into conflict, and their differing philosophies shape the politics, warfare, and alliances of the undersea world.

- **Territorial Orcas**: These orcas defend fixed territories like strongholds or regions, ruling their domains with unwavering authority. Their focus is on control, defense, and maintaining order within their borders. They often have fortified strongholds and established power structures, akin to feudal lords or regional warlords.
    - **Example**: The **Ironjaw Clan** controls underwater trenches rich in resources, raiding nearby coastal settlements and merchant ships to maintain their dominance.
- **Intercontinental Orcas**: These orcas are driven by expansion and conquest, much like Genghis Khan. Their territories are fluid, as they prioritize expanding their influence, waging war on rival clans, and seizing resources. They often move from place to place, launching massive campaigns to conquer both land and sea.
    - **Example**: **Vrath Darkfin** of the **Darkfin Clan** is known for launching stealth attacks and subduing rival orca clans, as well as expanding his power over important shipping lanes.

---

## Society Structure

Orca society is highly stratified, with each clan led by a **warlord** who commands the loyalty of their warriors, priests, and shamans. These warlords, whether **territorial** or **intercontinental**, wield immense power and are often regarded as the ultimate authority within their domains.

---

### Territorial Orca Warlords

- **Title**: Lord of the Southern Seas
- **Territory**: Southern orca territories, including underwater trenches and coastal areas rich in resources.
- **Description**:  
    A traditional **territorial warlord**, [[Throk Ironjaw]] rules over his domain with brute strength. The [[Ironjaw Clan]] specializes in defending its strongholds and maintaining control over valuable underwater resources. Throk’s forces are unparalleled in direct combat, defending their lands from both rivals and human invaders alike. His clan is feared for its brutal raids on coastal towns and merchant vessels, and his leadership ensures that no rival clan dares challenge his grip on the southern seas.

- **Title**: Tyrant of the Western Oceans

- **Territory**: Nomadic, with influence in the northern seas and key underwater trade routes.
- **Description**:  
    Unlike territorial orca warlords, [[Vrath Darkfin]] operates as an **intercontinental conqueror**, expanding his influence through stealth and subterfuge. The **Darkfin Clan** is a nomadic force, rarely staying in one place for long as they seek to dominate the northern depths and crucial trade routes. Vrath’s spies and assassins strike from the shadows, often weakening his enemies before launching decisive invasions. His ultimate goal is the complete domination of all northern seas.

#### 2. **[[Zarek Tidecaller]]** – Warlord of the [[Tidecaller Clan]]

- **Title**: High Shaman of the Eastern Waters
- **Territory**: Fluid, with control over key elemental sites and spiritual strongholds.

The **Tidecaller Clan** moves from place to place, conquering and absorbing the magical sites they come across, always looking to expand their influence over the seas’ elemental forces.

---

### Hybrid Warlords (Territorial and Expansionist)

Some orca warlords embody traits of both **territorial** and **intercontinental** power. They have established realms, but also seek expansion through conquest. These hybrid leaders often strike a balance between defense and offense, building powerful fortresses while launching raids on rivals.

#### 1. **[[Frostmaw]]** – Warlord of the [[Icefang Clan]]

- **Title**: Chieftain of the Frozen Waters
- **Territory**: Northern arctic seas, with expansion into southern regions.
- **Description**:  
    [[Frostmaw]] is a hybrid leader, ruling over the frozen northern seas with an iron fist but also seeking to expand his territory into warmer southern waters. His warriors are highly skilled in surviving and waging guerrilla warfare in the harshest of conditions. The **Icefang Clan** controls their frozen strongholds but often sends raiding parties further south to conquer and claim new resources.

---

## Orca Traditions and Culture

Orca society is steeped in ancient traditions, with each clan following unique customs that define their way of life. The following practices are common across both **territorial** and **intercontinental** clans, though they may vary slightly depending on the clan’s specific beliefs.

### 1. The Orca Bloodfeast

After a successful raid or battle, orca clans gather to feast on their spoils. These **Bloodfeasts** serve as both celebrations and religious rituals, often involving symbolic displays of dominance such as consuming the flesh of their enemies or performing rituals to honor their ancestors.

- **Territorial Orcas**: These clans often hold feasts within their fortified strongholds, reinforcing their control over their territories.
- **Intercontinental Orcas**: These orcas celebrate in temporary camps or while on the move, focusing more on the spoils of conquest and preparing for their next target.

### 2. Trials of Strength and Endurance

In orca society, strength and resilience are highly valued. Young orcas must undergo grueling **Trials of Strength** to prove their worth to their clan. These trials often involve feats of endurance, combat, or the use of magic, depending on the clan.

- **Ironjaw Clan**: Initiates must bite through metal-reinforced objects to prove their strength.
- **Tidecaller Clan**: Young orcas must survive a **maelstrom** created by their shamans, proving their resilience and mastery over elemental magic.

### 3. Spirit Communion and Elemental Worship

Shamanistic traditions play a critical role in orca society, particularly for the **Tidecaller Clan** and other spiritually inclined orcas. These clans often commune with sea spirits and elemental forces, seeking guidance for warfare, territorial expansion, and political decisions.

- **Zarek Tidecaller** frequently performs rituals to summon **elemental spirits**, using them to bolster his clan’s military and magical capabilities.
- **Spirit Walkers** in the **Icefang Clan** commune with ancient ice spirits to maintain control over the frozen seas and secure alliances with frost giants.

---

## Conflicts and Alliances

Despite the shared traditions and cultural practices, the **Orca Clans** are often in conflict with one another. **Territorial Warlords** defend their domains from ambitious rivals, while **Intercontinental Warlords** seek to conquer new lands. Occasionally, the clans form **alliances** when faced with external threats, such as **krakens** or human naval forces, but these alliances are often tenuous and fraught with internal strife.

- **Territorial Orcas** tend to view expansionist orcas with suspicion, often perceiving them as reckless and destabilizing forces.
- **Intercontinental Orcas**, in turn, see territorial warlords as stagnant and overly conservative, believing that their reluctance to expand weakens orca society as a whole.
