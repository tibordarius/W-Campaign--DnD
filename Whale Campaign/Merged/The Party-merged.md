### Charter of the Esteemed Fellowship of Adventurous Enterprises

  

In the Name of Honor, Reason, and Boundless Adventure, This Day of Freeman’s Reckoning:

  

Let it be known to all who read these words: We, the undersigned, namely Algernon, Elrick, Golgomov, Ruselia, and Tessa, of unimpeachable name (though occasionally dubious conduct), do hereby declare the formation of a fellowship for the joint ownership and operation of a ship, named "Song of the Abyss", and the pursuit of fortune, glory, and all manner of associated ventures.

#### Article I: Purposes of the Fellowship

1. The Fellowship, hereafter referred to as "The Company", is established for the undertaking of maritime adventures, the retrieval of treasures, the vanquishing of foes (be they man, beast, or other), and the equitable sharing of spoils.
    
2. Matters of a personal nature (such as vendettas, romantic entanglements, or the collection of peculiar trinkets) are excluded from The Company’s business unless agreed upon by all.
    

#### Article II: Membership and Shareholding

1. The five founders are equal partners, each entitled to one-fifth of the profits, after the deduction of shared expenses.
    
2. No member of The Company may transfer their share to a third party without the written consent of the others, ideally accompanied by strong drink and a sea shanty.
    
3. Each member shall contribute according to their ability, whether it be financial, physical, magical, or through some other skill that benefits The Company.
    

#### Article III: Governance and Decision-Making

1. Decisions shall be made by majority vote, except:
    

1. In matters concerning the sale of "Song of the Abyss";
    
2. Should a member cry out "This is madness!", in which case the decision must be revisited after a night of deliberation.
    

3. Golgomov shall serve as Captain and first among equals, unless he be drunk, captured, or aboard another vessel. In such cases, leadership shall temporarily fall to the member with the most fingers remaining.
    

#### Article IV: Finances and Treasure Chest

1. The shared profits shall be stored in the treasure chest of The Company, hereafter referred to as "Our Glorious Booty", which must remain aboard the ship at all times, unless the ship is sunk, in which case "Our Glorious Booty" shall take precedence over all passengers, save the owner of the chest.
    
2. Expenses for repairs, provisions, and other necessities shall first be paid from "Our Glorious Booty".
    
3. Personal loans from "Our Glorious Booty" are permitted, provided they are repaid within a reasonable time—ideally before the lender meets their untimely demise.
    

#### Article V: Liability and Conduct

1. Each member is responsible for their own actions, unless such actions are so absurd that the remaining members declare them "part of the adventure."
    
2. Brawls among members are permissible, provided they are accompanied by drinks and followed by apologies.
    

#### Article VI: Dissolution of the Fellowship

1. The Company shall be dissolved upon:
    

1. The death of four out of five members;
    
2. The intentional sinking of "Song of the Abyss" in honour of a mighty sea spirit;
    
3. A unanimous decision that "enough is enough."
    

3. Upon dissolution, the assets of The Company shall be fairly divided, unless "Our Glorious Booty" is lost, in which case the fate of the assets shall be left to chance and intrigue.
    

#### Article VII: Zany Hijinks and Unforeseen Circumstances

1. Should a member encounter an improbable stroke of luck (such as discovering a magical conch or striking a deal with a sea deity), they are required to report it at the following meeting.
    
2. Should a dispute arise that is not covered by these articles, it shall be resolved by either a duel, a game of dice, or a game of imbibement.
    

  

Signatures

On this day, at the first light of dawn, we, the Esteemed Five, have affixed our names to this charter. May our friendship, profits, and liquor stores never run dry.

  

Algernon
