## Overview

This document outlines advanced options for shipbuilding and customization, allowing players to create personalized vessels that reflect their playstyle, mission goals, and status. These customizations can range from functional enhancements to aesthetic modifications and are designed to give the players an edge in naval combat, exploration, and trade. The materials used in these ship designs can have unique properties that affect the ship's performance and capabilities.

### **Key Concepts in Advanced Ship Customization**

1. **Hull Materials**
    - Different hull materials offer varying benefits in durability, speed, and resistance to environmental conditions. These materials can be acquired through quests, trade, or found in rare locations.
        
    - **Ironwood**:
        
        - **Properties**: Strong, durable wood harvested from the enchanted forests. Ironwood provides additional protection against fire damage and grants a +2 to the ship’s Armor Class (AC).
        - **Cost**: Expensive, requiring rare resources and specialized shipwrights.
    - **Blackstone**:
        
        - **Properties**: A dark, magically-infused stone used for reinforcement. Ships with Blackstone hulls are highly resistant to magical attacks and have a +3 bonus to saves against magical effects.
        - **Cost**: Blackstone is rare and requires high-level arcane knowledge to integrate.
    - **Living Coral**:
        
        - **Properties**: A unique, regenerative material that heals minor damage over time. The ship restores 10 HP at the start of each turn during combat.
        - **Cost**: Found in the [[Coral Reef of Aldora]], Living Coral ships require an ongoing relationship with sea druids to maintain the coral’s vitality.

2. **Sails and Rigging**
    - Customizing the sails and rigging of a ship can greatly affect its speed and maneuverability. Special materials or designs can improve performance in specific weather conditions or during combat.
        
    - **Silk Sails**:
        
        - **Properties**: Lightweight and incredibly strong, these sails grant the ship increased speed (+10 to the ship’s base speed) and maneuverability, especially in light wind conditions.
    - **Void-Woven Sails**:
        
        - **Properties**: These sails are made from material infused with planar magic, allowing the ship to navigate through dimensional rifts or the [[Astral Sea]].
        - **Cost**: Requires an arcane crafter and rare planar materials found in the [[Astral Plane]].

3. **Weaponry Customization**
    - Ships can be outfitted with a variety of weapons, ranging from traditional cannons to magical artillery. Advanced weapon systems can offer unique tactical advantages in naval combat.
        
    - **Arcane Ballista**:
        
        - **Description**: A ballista infused with magical energy, capable of firing projectiles that deal additional force damage. It can be charged with different elemental energies (fire, ice, lightning).
        - **Damage**: 6d6 force damage + 1d6 elemental damage (determined by the type of energy used).
    - **Harpoon Launchers**:
        
        - **Description**: Designed to immobilize enemy ships or large sea creatures, harpoon launchers fire heavy projectiles attached to chains.
        - **Special Ability**: When a harpoon hits a target, it reduces the ship's movement speed by half until the harpoon is removed.
    - **Lightning Cannons**:
        
        - **Description**: High-tech cannons that fire concentrated lightning bolts. These cannons are effective against ships and sea monsters alike, dealing massive damage with each hit.
        - **Damage**: 4d10 lightning damage per hit, with a chance to disable enemy ship systems temporarily.

### **Ship Modifications**

1. **Reinforced Bulkheads**
    
    - **Properties**: Reinforces the ship’s interior structure to withstand greater damage. Adds 50 HP to the ship's total and increases resistance to crushing damage (such as from giant sea creatures or shipwrecks).
2. **Elemental Shielding**
    
    - **Description**: Protective magic is woven into the ship's hull, granting resistance to a specific elemental type (fire, cold, lightning, etc.). This upgrade is ideal for ships traveling through dangerous elemental regions such as volcanic islands or stormy seas.
    - **Cost**: Requires the services of a skilled mage and materials related to the chosen element.
3. **Submersible Capability**
    
    - **Description**: This upgrade allows the ship to function underwater for a limited time, ideal for exploration missions or evading enemies.
    - **Duration**: The ship can remain submerged for up to 2 hours before needing to resurface.
    - **Cost**: Requires a highly specialized shipwright and materials from the [[Abyssal Trench]].

### **Ship Aesthetics and Status Symbols**

1. **Figurehead Customization**
    
    - **Description**: Players can customize the figurehead of their ship, which not only serves as a symbol of prestige but can also grant magical bonuses.
        - **Dragon Figurehead**: Grants the ship advantage on intimidation checks against other vessels.
        - **Serpent Figurehead**: Provides a minor resistance to poison and the ability to sense nearby creatures in the water.
2. **Luxury Cabins**
    
    - **Description**: Upgrading the ship’s interior with luxury cabins adds comfort for the crew and visiting dignitaries, increasing the crew’s morale and improving the chances of successful diplomacy when hosting important figures.
    - **Bonus**: +2 on persuasion checks when negotiating with merchants or allies aboard the ship.

### **Shipwrights and Unique Locations**

1. **Master Shipwright Vanir Windrider**
    
    - **Location**: Found in the [[Freeport of Lysara]], Vanir is known for building fast and sleek vessels, favored by privateers and smugglers alike.
    - **Specialty**: Windrider specializes in speed-enhancing customizations and integrating rare materials like [[Living Coral]].
2. **The Forge of Rookstone**
    
    - **Location**: A legendary shipyard located within a volcano, known for crafting ships with [[Blackstone]] reinforcements.
    - **Specialty**: Ships built here are prized for their durability and resistance to magical attacks, and only a handful of Blackstone ships exist.

It corresponds to the first “civilizations” defined as such, and (in broad lines) especially those settling in West Asia, especially in the vast fertile plain between the Tigris and the Euphrates, Sumerians, Mesopotamians, and on the Nile, Egypt, or the first Yu Chinese empire early junks.

Further east, Indus civilization, represented by seven flourishing and modern cities-states on a river now disappeared (Mohendjo-Daro, Harappa). The Phoenicians of course, the first Mediterranean commercial empire from Tyr, first to ciscumnavigate Africa (Hanno) and travel beyond “Hercules columns”. The Carthaginians (Punic) who founded Carthage (now Tunis) settled permanently in the Western Mediterranean and consolidated their own empire, in rivalty with the Greeks (Macedonians, Thracians and Illyrians included), who imposed their domination against the Persians, and eventually the Romans who made them “Mare Nostrum”, and passed their traditions and strenght to the Byzantines, well into the end of the medieval era.

_200 BC, 127 years after Alexander the great passed out._

The Romans also struggled against the last empires of the Diadochi (descendants of the generals of Alexander the Great), the Empire of the Ptolemies in Egypt, the Antigonids of Macedonia and Attalides of Pergamos, Rhodians, Seleucids… The battle of Actium (31 BC) which will mark the end of the Ptolemaic naval power will also illustrate the end of the pre-eminence of the heavy units and the triumph of the pragmatic Roman naval approach to naval warfare.

The fleet of Rome then having no enemy to fight, it was partially disarmed and Rome had to endure for centuries the constant threat of piracy in the Mediterranean. After the fall of Rome with the great invasions (400 BC), Constantinople took over by founding a navy capable of maintaining the naval superiority of the Byzantine empire, recovering and improving the Roman organization. But this story belongs to the Middle Ages…

Papyrus Rafts are the indirect witnesses (they were still manufactured fifty years ago) of the first vessels of the Nile, back in Neolithic times. They indeed existed in forms still advanced in 3000 BC. The Papyrus was, of course, the most common herbaceous found on the delta wetlands: It was available in large quantities, possessed a moderate buoyancy, good flexibility, and could give come in many braided forms. The typical raft had a raised bunch, held at both ends by a rope, The same one found on the first soft wooden boats.

The **Cibora** – the Papyrus boat – gradually passed in the shape of a basket or a basket, perhaps in 6000-7000 BC (Nile Neolithic peoples), to that, lying in a “shell”. The latter was full, in fact, and came with some accessories to be properly seaworthy, like a maneuver bench, a portico for a paddle used as a drift, and a bipod mast on which was mounted a lattice sail (4000-3500 BC, before the founding of the two Kingdoms).

**Thor Eyerdhal** experimented with the Ra-I in the 1960s but proved that it was absolutely essential to raise the stern as much as possible to prevent water from impregnating papyrus too much. It is only on this condition that a large ship (made of boots thicker than in the center, constituting the shell) could sail in the Mediterranean, on the great rivers, even in the Indian Ocean, which Ra II inspired Aztec ships demonstrated superbly, as did the Tigris (Mesopotamia). Despite their qualities, Papyrus boats had reduced buoyancy for a certain size, and a length limited to 10 meters at most. It was therefore logical that they should give way at some point to wooden vessels.

### EGYPTIAN ANCIENT EMPIRE: The Kheops Ship

![Kheops funerary boat](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kheops.jpg)  
A veritable archeological time capsule, this large vessel has been preserved for more than 4500 years (…), thanks to the dryness of the desert and rarefied oxygen in this fully hermetic chamber hold by massive stone slabs, perfectly adjusted. In other words, the container is as fascinating as the content. Until now, the only evidence of these funerary ships, among the best known of the ancient Egyptian ships (pre-Ptolemaic), were finely carved and decorated sculptures found in the Royal tombs.

The **Kheops funeral boat** was a very light ship, built as expected in planks of fine wood (cedar of Lebanon and not Acacia or Sycamore, too light for her size) linked by planks. The **Khufu Funeral Bark** is also remarkable for its state of conservation. The funeral bark of Cheops was part of a complex of five boats at the foot of the Pyramid, three stone on the surface east of the pyramid and two genuine, enclosed in sealed basins. Only the boat described was exhumed, discovered in 1954n raised up and recomposed (1224 or 1244 pieces). She measures 43 meters long by 6 wide, and weighs about 45 tons.

Her hull has a covered bridge, and measured up to 1.75 meters. She is on display, in a dedicated room, with a rigorously controlled hygrometry, while wooden had been treated. She is brown, without colors, but she was very probably painted. The dyes, however, too fragile, have not been found and count not be rendered again.

The funeral boat is the solar boat, a very important myth in Egypt of the ancient dynasties because they are linked to the course of the boat of Osiris in the sky (The race of the Sun). It also symbolizes the passage of the deceased into the world beyond, the boat being reserved only to Pharaoh, the equal of the Gods…

On the technical side again, this boat has nautical qualities surprising enough for a boat intended for the Nile. Obviously, she had highly studied shapes and a more solid construction than usual (like the characteristic master-rope joining the bow and the stern and rigidifying the entire hull – some describes it as an “aerial keel” since her duty was similar).

This Demonstrate to the envy that the Egyptians were also Great navigators, although testimonies left us to suppose the contrary. It seems that the builders of this boat have benefited from enlightened advice from seafaring peoples or in contact with maritime civilizations. In this case, there arises the problem of functionality, for the funeral boat was not destined to leave the Nile.

What is certain is that the embalmed body of Cheops was on board when the bark ended its crossing in front of the immense ramp on which the procession would advance, facing the impressive white pyramid. A display Worthy of the Gods …

Other boats of very high quality, still older (5000 years) were found, like the **Abydos boats** (Upper Egypt). These 14 ships discovered in 1999-2000 were lined up in the desert. According to preliminary studies, these were 20-by-3 meters cedar boats, manned by 30 rowers. Their construction also seemed very solid and suitable for offshore navigation.

#### ANCIENT EMPIRE COMMERCE BOATS

![egyptian ancient empire merchant boat](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nav_com_anc_egypt.gif)  
This type of Egyptian merchant ship is one of the oldest known (2500 to 3000 BC). It is recognizable on numerous bas-reliefs, with very specific characteristics, such as its foldable twin-boom mast, its sail made of linen or papyrus, its shell stitched in cedar of Lebanon, or else in local Sycamore or Acacia which Did not allow planks more than two meters long. These ships also had a quarter-deck with six “rudders”, in fact differently handled paddles, the ancestor of the ancient oars, which predominated until the middle of the Middle Ages with the arrival of the Chinese axial rudder.

#### KEFTION

![Ancient egyptian boat Keftion](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/keftion_hatchepsout.gif)  
The Keftion and Képen were two types of Egyptian military boats of the new empire. They retained the characteristics of other typical Egyptian ships, such as the hulled-lined hull made of cedar leaf tied and waterproofed, making it a so-called “soft” keelless ship, held by a solid rope stretched between the stern And the bow. The sail was made of braided papyrus. This vessel had a relatively low length/width ratio of 6 or 7 to one, and had two fellows for the archers. With the advent of Tuthmosis III, these ships saw their construction reinforced by transverse bars, but still no couples. In 1480 BC, J.C., Queen Hatshepsut sent five Keftions loaded with goods on the Somali coast (the country of Punt at the time), crossing the canal linking the Nile to the Red Sea, built almost 2000 years BC. J.C.

#### KEPEN

![ancient egyptian Kepen](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kepen.gif)

As much as the Keftion was a rather commercial vessel, the Képen was the archetype of the pre-Hellenistic Egyptian warship. Built more for speed and lacking carrying capacity, it was nevertheless constructed in the same way as trade ships, with cedar wood or other related species, a stitched hull with transverse reinforcement beams, and rope running from the prow to the stern for extra rigidity. There was indeed no keel to speak of, invented later by the Phoenicians. The Képen specifics also were bulwarks protecting rowers and soldiers, a long footbridge and a mast top for a watchman/archer. The spur was a weapon of the Kepen, although boarding the enemy ship after watering its bridge with arrows of arrows was the common tactic.

The length of a Kepen could hardly exceed 30 meters. They are known to us by an inscription leaving no doubt and describing well the “Képen” like a warship, a bas-relief found at Medinet Abou describing the conquests of Ramses III in 1170 BC. As early as 1300 BC, indeed, piracy developed at the same time as the flourishing trade relations that Egypt maintained with the Mycenaean and Cretans, Egypt being the interface between India (from 1800 BC thanks to a connecting canal between the Nile and the Red Sea) and the Mediterranean. The Egyptians fought naval battles against famous seafarers, Philistines, Danaens and Achaeans, including the most infamous “Sea Peoples” that brings a new dark age to the area, wiping out several brilliant civilizations.

### PHOENICIAN GAULOS

![Phoenician gaulos](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gaulos.gif)  
The Phoenician freighter _par excellence_, the Gaoul (or Gaulos) was the perfect compromise between the Greek and Egyptian influences.

The emblematic Phoenician ship was symmetrical with clean and well-defined characteristics. When the Phoenicians founded Tyre, (Biblos, much earlier, dated back to 7000 BC), they soon had contact with Crete and the brilliant Minoan civilization that resided there. The latter built ships without holding ropes between the prow and the stern, but a keel instead, denoting a much more rigid construction than the standard vessels of the time, those of the Egyptians.

The latter flexible ships, were dependent on small timber and planks sewn. The Minoans seem to be the first to have replaced the string reinforcements with a rigid structure by itself, with a wooden keel on which intermediate pieces (cribs) were laid and on which large arched planks were attached. This shipbuilding revolution, the Phoenicians welcomed it with eagerness, being for a long time under control of the Egyptians.

The Gaoul, in some respects, still had an Egyptian appearance, with a round hull, raised stern and bow, woven sail held between two masts. But it had holding rope, and for good reason: Planking and structure were made of Syria Cedar, the most massive and rigid wood in the area, which had no equivalent in the Levant.

When the Phoenicians emerged from the Egyptian orbit, during the Middle Bronze Age and its contacts with the city-state of Ugarit, it allowed it to gain a technology that boosted commercial extension, from current Lebanon to the columns of Hercules and beyond (trade with the Celts of south-east England, Cornwall), perhaps even a trading post in the Azores and on the American coast.

Innumerable counters were only intended to allow any vessel coasting the day along the coasts to find a haven for the night. Only one true colony was founded, Carthage, which established a new milestone between the Asiatic part and the western part of the Mediterranean, in a crossroads of sea lanes making it impossible to circumvent.

Around 1100 BC, the relative freedom enjoyed by the Phoenicians was due to the decline of the great antagonistic empires of the region, Hittites and Egyptians. The Assyrians did not threaten them, and in general the Phoenicians formed a sphere of co-prosperity with the “peoples of the sea”. The Gaulos played a prominent role in this exchange:

It was sized enough to carry a large load of amphorae (including its deck in galleries to store amphoras vertically, covered by a canvas tent), And at the same time with a modest draft and a relatively flat bottom in the manner of the Egyptian ships allowing it to anchor almost everywhere and even to ascend the rivers. Finally, the Gaulos was characterized by a figure of prow often in the form of head of horse, and a figure of stern in fish tail.

The very name “Phoenician” was a Greek invention to designate peoples of similar culture; in reality they themselves were defined as Sidonites, Byblonians (Giblites), or Tyrians. It drew its origin from the phoenix, a divine bird of the Levant symbolizing the sun rising to the east. But about 800 BC. JC., An early decline began with the gradual seizure of the Assyrians over Tire and Sidon.

The Phoenicians being a peaceful people, they subdued and gradually lost their freedom of commercial action. The Persians in 540 BC. JC. Were therefore seen as liberators. The latter, faithful to their confederal policy, left much greater autonomy to the three great cities, but gradually, Carthage began to gain importance and to detach itself from its Phoenician origin to become fully independent.

Around the Gaulos: Arwad (Syria), Tarsus (Asia Minor), Kition, Paphos (Cyprus), Knossos (Crete), Malta, Hadrumet (South Coast of Carthage, Numidia), Cirta (Inland Numidia), Rachgoun (Current Morocco), Lixus (Atlantic Coast, Morocco), Mogador (Mauritania), Cádiz Seeing Marseilles, it is a colony of Asia Minor …), Tharros and Nora in Sardinia, Motye in Sicily (near Mytilene).

### ASSYRIAN BIREME

![assyrian bireme](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bireme_phenicienne.gif)  
The Phoenician war galleys left no wreck, for just as the immense majority of the ancient galleys their coefficient of buoyancy remained positive. On the other hand, bas-reliefs inform us to a certain extent, since the engravers were not sailors, and these lithographic testimonies must be taken with a certain distance, and a naval carpenter’s eye, leaving a part Reinterpretation. A model of terracotta is preserved in the museum of Haifa and shows one of these galleys, having a square sail, and quite narrow. A conformation adapted to the speed to the detriment of the place on board for the fighters, was solved by the innovation, taken again by the Greeks, of the gallery over the bridge.

The palace of Nineveh recounting the battle that took place beforehand (700 BC) confronting the forces of Sennacherib, the Son of the great King of Babylon Sargon II, and his biremes used as transports of armed troops on the Nâr Marratoum separating The Tigris and the Euphrates.  
It was a “pentecontore” in the sense that it had 26 oars per side, more than 50 rowers. From the top of their gallery, the Assyrian archers, protected by their shields hanging from the bulwarks, had a good shooting platform. These ships were unusual for Assyrians, users of river boats. The Phoenicians used them since 1500 BC. J.C. They are the inventors, but seem to have been inspired by the Cretans for the spur.

### MONERE: ARGO

![moneris argo](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/argo.gif)  
_Emblematic type of the monument of the ancient ages of the Mediterranean basin (from the fourteenth century, 10th century before our era), The Argo of the legend of Jason and the Golden Fleece. This representation of a largely ficticious vessel was made, perhaps for the need of a movie, but without historical accuracy in mind._

_[![Argo](http://www.greekexperience.gr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/argo-ship-copy-volos-greek-experience.jpg)  
This is the more accurate “Argo” reconstructed as a Pentekonter and is now displayed in the port of Volos.](http://www.greekexperience.gr/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/argo-ship-copy-volos-greek-experience.jpg) [Src](http://www.argonautes2008.gr/en/argo-ship/new-argo-ship.html) and also [official website](http://www.greekexperience.gr/portfolio-item/the-argo-ship/)._

The first galleys with a level of oars (monoreme for the Romans), the oldest, were generally undecked boats but with a small foredeck and aft, possibly a small hold. It was built “first hull”, a technique more elaborate than that of the first ships Egyptian and appeared around the thirteenth century BCE. It consisted of placing on a basic structure with keel and pairs, a plating made of wooden plates (the vats), assembled and held in place by mortises sunk into vertical notches and secured by tenons driven into the mallet.

To waterproof the whole, caulking was used, consisting of applying on the hull of fine linen cloth, coated with heated pitch, then bitumen. Later, towards the tenth century BC. J.C., small copper plates will be used to complete this waterproofing, in particular, due to the relatively rapid decomposition of the bitumen in the sea water.

The Argo of the legend was probably, according to the descriptions given by Ovide, a monoreme of 18 rowers: 9 rowers per side, with a helmsman, and an “officer.” The rowers participated in all the maneuvers of the board, including the brewing of the sail. The oars rest on tops (wooden rings fixed in the flanks of the bulwarks).

It also appears that this ship possessed a small spur, more a traditional feature than a weapon of war. The rosters used in an offensive role only took shape with more massive ships, Dières, Trières and Pentecontores. The reconstructed Argo is an example of what a “warship” could be, with a length of 15 meters, a width of 3.20, which gave it a ratio of 1/5, and made it a relatively Wide and versatile, halfway between a freighter and a real military unit.

The monitors derived from it, the Cisocontore, had hardly more than two rowers per side (20 in all), the Triconteros 30. the latter were clearly longer and had a ratio of 1/6, more favorable to the speed. These apparently appeared during the thirteenth century BCE.

### TRICONTER

![Spartan Trikonteros](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tricontere_grecque.gif)

A Greek triconter at the time of the Trojan War (1450 BC). This one has 32 rowers, two better than the standard ones. Some late twenties had twenty rowers per side, or 40 in all: The pentaconter was only a logical evolution.

Dikonteros, Cisokonteros, Trikonteros. These terms are known from later writings, from the 5th to the 6th centuries before our era for the most part. They apply to galleys of moner type (a single row of oars, a rowing oar), specific to the Greek navy but not only: Assyrians and Phoenicians also used such types of units, and before them Mycenaean and Minoan.

Although belonging to the majority of the warships of the time, the Phoenicians preferred the Dières, faster. These light galleys date back to the very beginning of the hard construction, with keels and pairs in oak, lined with pine assembled with clinkers (the juxtaposition of planks held by tenons and mortises).

However, these small units formed most of the fleets in the VIIIth century before our era, before precisely the appearance of the Pentacontères and especially the Greek Dières. They never disappeared but were gradually assigned to second-rate roles, due to their agility.

One might even say that they were “second class” units, assigned to liaison and training tasks, or for the transport of rapid troops. But their military value in combat, and this as early as Salamis in 491 BC. J.C., was more reduced in front of heavy units capable of using more effectively their rostrum in effect of mass or of embarking more men of troop.

The fleet which landed on the beach of Troy included both standard cargo vessels, Pentaconteros, cisoconteros (20 rowers), and tricontères (30), intermediates falling between two types with the name of the base class: Avant Pentecontère, the most efficient line ship was to be the 40-oared tricontère, twenty per side. It could have been called tettacontère, but this term was rarely seen in the writings of the chronicles of the time.

A Diconteros or Cisoconteros, systematically employed ten rowers per side. A Triconteros, fifteen. It was their employment that later justified the appearance of the Dieres, consisting in doubling the number of rowers by two rows of oars on the same side, increasing power and speed without excess weight, and the Pentacontère, ultimate attempt To combine the classical scheme of the monoreme with an increase in the number of rowers. The latter proved to be finer and therefore faster theoretically, but being as long and heavy as the Dier, it lacked power.

In any case, the dikonteros generally measured 20 to 23 meters, the tricontères 23 to 26. They had a width of 3.20 to 4.20 meters, and weighed between 15 and 35 tons. They could have a small hold, often lodged under the forecastle, used as a platform for combat by the hoplites.

Their veil being very simple to handle, it is quite possible that there were only two sailors loaded with it, unless it was the rowers themselves. As a result, the complete crew, including soldiers, of a dicontère had to be 28 men, and 40 for the Triconter. It is probable that the first diconter were even more modest and light, for they were stranded on the sand, taking advantage of the tides, before the hard-packed holds appeared.

### PENTAKONTER

![Athenian pentakonteros](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pentecontore_gr.gif)  
_A Pentaconter of Sparta, Peloponnesian War (5th century BC)._

The Pentecontore, or Pentacontère, must not be confused with the “pentere”, not a usual contraction, but the Greek designation of the Roman quinqueremes. This galley was a logical evolution of the Triacontores (30 rowers) and the Cisocontores (20 rowers) of the family of monorems (one rower per bench and rowing).

The Pentekontoros is larger and therefore more conducive to the embarkation of troops (archers, hoplites), faster and stable because it is as wide but better equipped as human power, more massive and therefore more efficient at ramming. Became the standard military ship of the Athenian fleet at war with Rhodes, Macedonia, pirates, and especially the hereditary enemy, the Persian Empire.

Before the Dies emerged, these penteconteros formed the majority of the units of the ancient fleets from the 4th century BC The Persians made extensive use of these ships at Salamis, as these were their only main units, and were beaten By the Greeks who put Dières et Trières in line. The Pentecontents formed the bulk of the light units of the Macedonian, Carthaginian, Roman, and Ptolemaic fleets, disappearing in 200 AD, replaced by the Liburnes and their two or three oarsmen rowing, called “scaloccio swimming.”

Length of 27 to 30 meters on average, ranging from 3.50 to 3.80 meters, moving about 40 or 50 tons, the Pentecontore had a flared section hull. She had a crew reduced to an officer, a helmsman, a “quartermaster” (giving the rhythm of swimming, the Greek rowers being volunteers paying a “right of Passage “and not slaves, some of which could participate in the fighting in case of collision.), Ten hoplites, able to move on a thin central platform, the” gateway “faithful to the original semantics, Shapes to the foredeck and back. In case of ramming, the tripoint bronze rostrum benefited from the mass effect of the galley launched at 5-6 knots (10 Km/h).

### DIERE

![Corinthian Dieris](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/diere_grecque.gif)  
_A Dier from the 6th century BC. J.C. Note the “dolphin” serving as a rostrum, of doubtful effectiveness, the skins stretched to protect the forecastle from the front projectiles, and the ladder placed at the rear._

The Dier was a revolution in the naval domain. Though originally introduced by the Phoenicians and Assyrians in the eighth century BC, which were undeniably paternal, the galleys of war were systematically moners (or monoremes – a single row of oars). The fleets counted on cisocontères and tricontères, two centuries before the invention of the Pentecontère.

Overall, the Greek Dier appeared only a century later. It was probably introduced by a Corinthian shipbuilder, hired by Ameinocles, who observed the effectiveness of the Phoenician models. It is based on two rows of 12 rowers per side, representing a total of 48 rowers, a little less than a penteconteros.

The Dieris also had a meager crew composed of the Dierarch (captain), four deck officers, a helmsman, a “drummer” to keep the swim rate, and four sailors maneuvering, among other things, the Sails. In addition, there were four or six hoplites and two archers, depending on tactical choices. The effectiveness of the Dier to the ramming was already more convincing than for the Assyrian and Phoenician models smaller and light.

The Greek Dier indeed is relatively massive, deep and wide. With a generous hold (probably largely filled with salted meat amphorae and stretched skin bags filled with fresh water), an average length of 31 meters, a width of 4.20 meters, a draft at full load Of a meter ten, and a displacement of 75 tons, the Diere was of comparable weight, and slightly superior to the pentakonteros.

However, the advantage of a staged swimming allowed, unlike the great moners like the pentakonteres, to gain space. The length of the first Dies being thus slightly less, their maneuverability was reinforced accordingly. Thereafter, their tonnage and dimensions increased with the increased number of rowers.

It is also often forgotten to say the fundamental difference between the Greek Dier and the Roman biremes developed later: Their rowers were free men, citizens paying a right of passage or not, and also, as many potential fighters in case of confrontation.

Being rowing on an Athenian galley could also be a very respectable military post, these rowers being specifically trained for combat, within case of collision the physical limit of exhaustive exhaustion following swift maneuvers in combat. The reconstructions of Dières were rare, one can quote recently that carried out by the Ukrainians with their Ivlia.

In Combat: The Dieres engaged at Salamis (480 BC) possessing possibly formidable weapons such as the dolphin, widely used by the Romans thereafter, a collision weapon, held by a yard itself secured to the mast, And dropped on the deck of the opposing ship. It was a weight (lead) that had been given the shape of a large point, in order to easily cross the two to three levels of wood (the bridge, the bridge and the hold in the case of the Dieries).

The aim was to provoke an important waterway, the galley of this period being, practically, unsinkable. Also, fire could also be a weapon of choice. At the side of the Hoplites, elite fighters well armed with handguns and throwers, there were sometimes “light” fighters, the epibatai, who could shortly before the collision, launch on the opponent, in addition Lances, “pots”, small round amphorae filled with pitch, and inflamed with a tissue, an ancestor of the incendiary bombs of which they protected themselves by bulwarks stretched of skin and soaked with oil.

The ballista and catapults entered shortly afterwards, enabling the distance of the combat to be increased to a hundred meters.  
Let us recall, finally, that the rowers of these galleys were volunteers who paid their way by rowing, or were enrolled, and touching the pay. They had a cushion coated with grease, which allowed them to slide on their smooth benches, their feet well wedged in the previous bench, flexing their legs.

This technique allowed them to provide the minimum effort for the best efficiency. In addition, the rowers owned their cushion and paddle and were able to embark in any galley. When the Spartans attacked the Athenians in 476 BC, They crossed a tongue of land on foot, carrying their oars and cushions. The complex swimming technique required a training of 8 months per year for a full-time rower…

### ATHENIAN TRIERE

![Athenian Trieris](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/triere_athenienne.gif)  
  
The Triere is the most famous and celebrated classical “heavy” unit of the Antique fleets. Greek Invention, taking advantage of by Admiral Themistocles at the battle of Salamis, where he defeated the Persian fleet of Xerxes in 480 BC. J., the triere was obtained by adding a rower and a bench to the Dieris, to reach 170 rowers.

Scarcely larger and longer than the Diere, but a little heavier (about 80 to 85 tons), the Trieris was considerably faster and devastating than dieris and older Pentekonters. The trieris was famous also by the enigma to the historians who wondered how to manage the swimming with such a disposition of the rowers.

Napoleon III reconstructed and tested one on the seine, which only reinforced the mystery, while through more recent reconstructions, modern archeology gives its answer, supported by frescoes, paintings, mosaics, bas-reliefs, sculptures as iconographic evidence and texts.

The triere demonstrated that it was quite manageable by playing along the length of the oars and physical condition of the rowers, and relatively effective for the time. Replenishments: Napoleon III was passionate like most of his contemporaries (Romantic period, mid-XIXth Century) by ancient civilizations. He helped to clarify the trieris mystery on his personal funds.

His disappointing essays only deepened the enigma. John Morrison and John Coates, in 1988 reconstituted the “Olympias”, a Greek trireme of 500 BC, and solved the problem. The lessons learned from this empirical experience with Thor Eyerdhal deserve a complete dossier. Here is the unpublished report of this experiment signed John Morrison and published in issue 183 (June 1993) of the files of the archeology:

“At an international conference deliberately called” Advisory discussion “held in April 1983 at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, Dr. Coates and I proposed the proposed reconstruction of a triple Athenian V And the sixth century BC Following this conference, the “Trireme Trust” was created in Britain, which was later invited by the Hellenic navy to collaborate with it in order to construct a trireme grandeur nature according to the concepts we Developed.

This ship, launched in June 1987 in Piraeus and named “Olympias”, was put into service after the technical tests to which it was submitted in August of the same year by the Navy and the trust acting in concert. Trials followed in 1988, 1990 and 1992. 1993 marks the tenth anniversary of the start of the project.

It is planned to sail the Olympias in June on the Thames to participate in the Anglo-Greek celebration of the 2500th anniversary of the birth of democracy in Athens. The ship will draw the attention of scholars and the public of Western Europe. It is, therefore, appropriate to review the aims of its construction, to examine what it has accomplished, to evaluate what it represents today and to draw lessons from the teaching it has given us (More to follow).

### RECONSTRUCTION: THE OLYMPIAS

[![Olympias](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/olympias_gd.gif)](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/olympias_gd.gif)

#### What is Olympias:

The trireme trust was founded to promote the construction of an Athenian triere copy. The Greek Trust and the Greek Navy can today congratulate themselves on achieving their goal by achieving Olympias. Their success is however disputed by some who point out that this ship is not rebuilt according to real vestiges of antique triere found to be discovered on seabed.

The objection is less admissible than it appears at first sight. First of all the Trières did not flow: When a waterway was declared there, they floated filled with water, and being unable to sail, they were towed. Even drowned, they had, like Olympias, a positive buoyancy coefficient. Constructed of wood, with only a small proportion of materials heavier than water, the average density of the building and its contents was, therefore, lower than that of water.

In the hypothesis that a trire was able, despite everything, to flow, how could an archaeologist identify it on the substance? Only the lower elements of the hull could have survived. But even in the presence of numerous vestiges, the archaeologist can not decide whether they are those of a trireme, but from what he knows of descriptions made in literature and inscriptions; The latter are the only means of identifying a vessel that appears on ancient representations.

There is only one exception to this: the grafitto of Alba Fucens on which one reads navis tetreri longa (quadrirème or “4”). The wrecks obviously do not have “etiquette”; Therefore the definite identification of a triere is impossible. In case one of them has sunk, the archaeologist will identify it only if he knows beforehand what he is looking for. Therefore, in the absence of a properly identified triere, Dr. Coates and I thought it would be reasonable to proceed as follows:

Gather all the trier data that we could find in the language, literature and inscriptions Various; Use these data to carry out probable identifications of triere representations; Introduce the imperatives of geometry and physics to draw a vessel that incorporates the data of the first and second points; And, as far as possible, construct a vessel according to this drawing, check its characteristics and performances, and compare them with the writings of ancient authors. This method would allow at least to recognize a trireme or its representation newly discovered but not accompanied by an inscription.

Legitimacy of reconstruction: Archaeologists have asked themselves whether experimental archeology, that is to say the reconstruction of objects which can only be a copy of their ancient model, was really or not of archeology in the “Strict acceptance of the term”.

The questioning of the merits of the construction and nature of the Olympias gives us the opportunity to present here the main arguments in its favor. Evidence, or evidence, of the reality of an ancient artefact can be direct and/or indirect.

## Revolutions in sciences and naval architecture

This period is often regarded as an era of perfecting ships of the line, making frigates and corvette a more substantial part of the fleets, and of pre-eminence and rivalry of the great European military and commercial empires, on the world’s stage.

Civilian ships are still generally of modest size, following coastal routes (apart the Indiamans) but with an exceptional diversification of forms resulting from the know-how of this seafaring people that are the Dutch. All these merchant ships have artillery on board. Some were in effect hybride warships, like the Dutch, English and French Indiamans, war and trade vessels or updated version of the Galleons. Global Empires went with considerable fleets and private companies became vital component of this strategy.

The era of great explorations was not over either, **La Pérouse** and **Cook** will push further back the boundaries of maps, still quite incomplete on the South Pacific. British-Dutch, then British and Dutch against the French marked the end of the eighteenth-century tall ships, derived from the galleons of the previous two centuries. Shipbuilding treaties tended to standardize more than ever shipbuilding, marking the transition between empiric traditions and baroque ornaments and cold mathematics concepts. A new, scientific approach to shipbuilding which was directly a result of the enlightenment. Faith in science, not in god or divine inspiration.

Brilliant engineers like **Frederik af Chapman** are cold typologists, who succeed to the old-time brilliance of the sculptors of the previous century. The ship of the line is rationalized, approaching pure functionality, an evolution which slowed down until 1850.

One can say that in the matter, these last great classical sailship battles would take place after the French revolution, in 1805 to Aboukir and Trafalgar, and by extension, at Navarin in 1827. But for the world’s culture, 1805 Trafalgar and Aboukir are the last major naval battles of the line fought by the greatest fleets of their time. The British, winning the seven-years war (some says the first true world war), and later the perile of Revolutionary France and Napoleon, securing a “pax Britannica” which endured until the end of the XIX the century, and the French and Spanish fleets, on the decline while the Dutch were just a souvenir.

## Northern Europe Merchant Ships

### Chat (Kat)

![Dutch Kat](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/lumempire/chat.gif)  
_The Dutch “Kat” is one of the most famous cargo ship of that enlightenment era, practising deep sea shipping as cabotage in northern Europe._

If in the seventeenth century Holland fought incessant wars against Great Britain, the low countries gradually lost its supremacy over world maritime trade in the next. However the creative genius of its engineers and craftsmen still made the reputation of its building sites. Originally the creators of a large number of European cargo ships, the Dutch invented the “Cat”, “Kat” originally. This term appeared in the Middle Ages to designate an intermediary between the nave and the galley, often a mixed ship of more than 200 rowers per board.

However this name was also applied to a totally different ship built by the Dutch to find a good compromise between the Flute and the Boyer. Rigged with two masts, she is a modest ship, devoted to the transport of coal or wood. However she evolved in the eighteenth century in a three-masted form. Her rounded transom, barge-like, and shallow draught gave way to a straight deck, and the Cat could be confused with other cargo ships including the Indiaman, but was strongly differentiated by its riverine capabilities and characteristics as well as low artillery embarked.

![3-mast Barque cargo](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/lumempire/3matsbarquehavrais.gif)  
_3-masted cargo barque_  
In the eighteenth century other merchant marines than the Dutch did not demerit. French and Great Britain merchant fleet recovered a bit of the market once held by the Dutch. This ship, shown here from 1750-70, is rigged in three-mast, even though many of the merchant ships of the time were satisfied with a Brick rig. Her crew was imposing. Pure cargo ship, her hull was particularly roomy, wide at the bow, the hull generally affecting almost a barge-like shape. Space had been made by removing artillery to further optimize the load, which indicated that the ship was limited to busy seaways in Europe, and probably had to be escorted. Very spartan aesthetically, her only concession to ornamentation lied in her transom.

## Enlightment Era Warships

![HMS Rose 1757](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/lumempire/hmsrose.gif)  
_A reconstruction of English frigate._  
The frigate HMS Rose was built in Hull in 1757. She was a “sixth rank” ship, barely superior to the corvettes of the same time. After a long service in the Channel and in the Caribbean, she was sent to the American thirteen Colonies in 1768. In 1774, under the command of James Wallace, she was sent to Rhode Island, in the Bay of Narragansett to put a stop to merchant traffic off Newport. As no American ship was at her level, she played her dissuasive role painstakingly.

From then on, Newport merchants petitioned their colonial legislature for a flotilla capable of attacking the British frigate. Financing the transformation of a merchant ship, they had a fast trading schooner chartered under the orders of John Paul Jones.

The latter became the very first ship of the future US Navy. Later, in May 1776, the colony of Rhode Island was shattered, followed two months later by the other colonies. During the war of independence that followed, the HMS Rose frigate participated in the New York landings, carrying out many raids and incursions far ahead of the Hudson. Wallace was made Chevalier by the crown. He pushed his action along the coast, recruiting civilian sailors for incorporation, capturing merchant ships, supplying garrisons, including Boston.

When the war reached a new level with the help of the French, turning in favor of the insurgents, the town of Savannah where the British frigate was anchored, was the object of a siege. The French fleet had planned a landing to take the city by sea, but the British had the frigate scuttled in the passage leading to the bay. As a result, the city supported the siege until the end of hostilities.

The Frigate was rebuilt in 1970 in Lunenberg, Nova Scotia under the direction of architect Phil Bolger, and has since been in constant representation. She made appearances in many films, sometimes repainted. For example, it was used for a full-size replica to be double the Surprise (Master and Commander).

![Hemmemaa](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/lumempire/hemmemaa.GIF)  
_Hemmemaa with latin rig (1781)_

Hemmemaa was the first and most famous of the “frigates of the archipelago” with the Turumaa. Designed by famous naval architect Frederick af Chapman to replace classic sailing frigates, too massive with a draft too strong for the Baltic shoals, the type was the spearhead of the Swedish fleet during the Second Northern war. Baltic against Catherine of Russia. The latter, as in the past and its model Pierre de Grand, uses Latin architects and builds ships directly from the Mediterranean basin, which are well adapted to the conditions of the Baltic (see “Russians Galleys”).

**Swedish ships** were even more original. In order to reap the benefits of the galley that inflicted defeats on them during the first Baltic War, Chapman conceived a modernized and more rational version of the old Galeasses, the very one who had defeated the Turks in Lepanto 1571.

But the **Galeass** have powerful artillery but in return, a strong draft. Chapman wanted to create lighter ships. His solution was to design ships with a central battery, the rest of the bridge being occupied by banks of rowers. These frigates of the archipelago, however, have three men per bench offset, and 24 to 22 guns per side, for 40 or 38 oars. The second figures are given for the smaller **Turumaa**. The other main difference between these two types of ships is that the Turumaa was usually only square rigged, while the **Hemmemaa** was most often Latin rigged. Both had 3 masts, four counting the bowsprit.

These ships replaced traditional sailing frigates used by the Swedes so far. They were in operation in the heart of summer, with melting ice. Several battles marked the use of these ships during the Second Baltic War: In 1788, the **Battle of Hoglund** was an indecisive encounter. The Swedes were however forced to stop their offensive. In 1789, the same scenario was repeated, and the Swedes took refuge in their Karlskrona base. The Russians started a blockade. In August 1789, the **first battle of Svenska Sund** started, when a Swedish convoy stood in defense against a Russian attack and were sunk.

About thirty ships carrying troops were destroyed or captured, as well as eight ships. In June 1790, the Swedes tried to prevent the junction of the Kronstadt and reval fleets. They did not succeed, and the offensive turned to rout. Their ships took refuge in Vybord, where the Russians in numbers blocked them there.

A month later, the Swedish squadron will succeed in forcing the blockade, but at the cost of high losses: 7 ships and more than 20 small transports, the Russians on their side did loose 11 ships. The Swedes were in defensive position in front of Svenska Sund in July 1790. The Russian attack failed in front of the strength of the fortifications and turned into rout. The Swedes chased the fugitives and still managed to destroy many more ships. In total, this Russian defeat would cost 64 ships of all tonnages on the 140 total of the Russian fleet. Empress Catherine was obliged to sign peace…

![Russian Lead Galley](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/lumempire/gdegalererusse.GIF)  
_Capped Lead Galley (1715)_

During the first Baltic War, Peter the Great, founder of St. Petersburg, called on Italian engineers and architects to define his galleys, the ship most suited to the shoals of the Baltic which was to be the node of his clashes with Sweden. Three types of galleys were defined to constitute the Russian fleet: “standard” galleys, about 40 meters, directly inspired by the Genoese and Venetian models, also built in the Black Sea, with a swim of 27 oars per side and four men each, “a scaloccio”, which represented a total number of 216 men, three artillery pieces in chase, sometimes two in stern, and a company of marine riflemen. The largest galleys, as in the Mediterranean fleets, were divided between “patrons” and “admirals”. Thes were to command a detachment of galleys and were a little larger (46 to 50 meters, 30 to 36 oars as the illustration above), and five men per bench, as well as reinforced artillery.

The total width was around 9 meters. The above illustration shows five artillery pieces, four 4-pounders and a 24-pounder, as well as six side pieces in the quarterdeck and two 18-pounder at the sterns, as well as 14 culverins. The smaller 3-pounders on mobile mounts were located on the side rails. These galleys-admirals were supreme command units to lead a squadron, likely to bear the Tsar’s mark in person. They were 50 meters long and over, with a crew of 380 rowers distributed by five out of the 38 oars per side, and using a mixture of bombards and 24, 18 and 12 pounders.

This same type of galley was still in use during the Second Baltic War led by Sweden’s King Gustav III against Catherine of Russia. Rarely armed in comparison to their size, the great Russian galleys could not seriously worry the Swedish ships except for ramming, thanks to a speed of 7 knots, quite formidable in calm weather. These are the “half galleys”, xebecs and half-xebecs, and the famous **Skampayevas** who were the most effective.

![Bomb Galiot](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/lumempire/galioteabombes.gif)  
_French Bomb Galiot like the Salamandre (1715)_

A French galiot, one of those which entered the composition of the fleet.  
This type of very specific and specialized siege shipe is born from the punctual need to have a heavy artillery capable of overcoming terrestrial objectives, including coastal fortifications and Vauban-style citadels. Their curved mortars placed in a central housing of the deck could if necessary also serve in battle, firing heavy incendiary bombs.

The name “galiot” is derived from flat-bottomed vessels used by the Dutch. The rig also was specific with a large mast very far back to clear the range of the mortar. Their artillery was completed by small side guns.

![Flambart](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/lumempire/flambart.GIF)  
_Normandy Flambart of the XVIII-XIXe cent._  
With her pansy air and auric rig, the Flambart has something of a “fishing coaster”. It was a Norman traditional ship, which is derived from the French term “flamber” in reference to the will-o’-the-wisps which sometimes clung during storms to the apple of the mast, also called St. Anselm fires, and which frightened superstitious sailors, as warning signs of disaster. This was a fast vessel for paddling (line or trawl) characterized by two masts, with the foresail leaning forward and the main mast rearward, very close.

They carried a horn sail and a foresail to the third, and a jib on the bowsprit. Saffron was small in size, so the maneuver was most often done in sailing. They fished by trawl and line, and occasionally by cabotage, since the eighteenth century. The Seine Bay shoals were also called flambarts in the same way. Flambart is also known as the Sailing Boat of the Bretons (from Britanny), carrying a large boom: The Dagou Jaguen is a small one.

![Russian Half Galley](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/lumempire/demigalererusse.GIF)  
_Russian Half Galley during the battle of the Gulf of Bothnia in 1714._  
If the great galleys inspired by the Genoese and Venetian models had some success, the models of galleys by far the most widespread in the Russian navy were the “half galleys”. Inspired by Mediterranean galiots and half-galleys, the latter simply presented themselves as shortened galleys, with fewer rowers (on average three men per bench, and from 18 to 25 oars per board, or a maximum of 150 rowers).

They had only two masts and large lateen sails. Their fellows seemed more important in proportion, and these ships had a modest artillery, limited to three pieces in chase, 6 and 18 pounders. But what seemed to be a weakness was counterbalanced by great manoeuvrability, which was lacking in larger models. With a maximum of 30 meters long by 5 wide, these half-galleys sneaked more easily and could interfere with the manoeuvrers of the opponent. They inspired a model of galley proper to Russia, even more modest, the famous **Skampaveyas**. The latter won many battles against the Swedes during the first Baltic War. The half galleys were still considered the spearhead of the navy of Catherine II of Russia in 1780.

![Russian Xebec](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/lumempire/chebec_russe.GIF)  
_Russian Xebec in 1789_

![Half-Xebec](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/lumempire/demi_chebec_russe.GIF)  
_Russian Half Xebec_

It is unusual to see the racy silhouette of these typically Mediterranean hybrid ships, symbols so feared by the Westerners as immediately associated with barbary pirates who raided the southern coast of Europe and merchant ships at the beginning of the Renaissance. True thoroughbred, the elegant xebec was a derivative of the galley, with the difference that the oars had been removed in favor of a very consistent sail, Latin, then by evolution, mixed, entirely square alternately to a Latin sail.

Related to the Polacca, which is a modern evolution, but also to the smaller Tartanes, the Spanish Felucca, the Mistic and the Warbler, the Pinque, the Xebec (Sciabecco in Italian) remains one of the symbols of the Mediterranean. Continuing to draw on this heritage in order to try to adapt it to the Baltic Sea, closed sea a priori suitable for this kind of ships, Catherine of Russia, inspired by Peter the Great, called on Spanish builders to build a few dozen of these boats and half-xebecs to oppose the heavy Swedish ships during the second Baltic war in 1788-90.

The Russians were thus barely modified copies of these ships which were also built and used in the French navy. Their draft was weak, their hulls narrow but without making them an unstable ship, their masts short, not composed or “to pible” and light carrying large Latin sails on antennas completed by jibs on the “bowsprit”, or a partially square sail, with a Latin veil at the front, a light square in the middle and a brigantine aft.

The demi-xebec was a shortened version, with two masts instead of three, wearing a Latin sail at the front, a brigantine aft surmounted by a square topsail. All were also maneuvering to rowing in case of flat calm, very practical to move in the sandy shallows of the islands of the Gulf of Bothnia. The crew of these ranged from 200 to 240 men, the half-xebecs with less than 150 men on board. The latter, more agile, carried an artillery reduced to 8 pieces of iron or advantage, while the xebecs aligned as standard 24 guns. They had the advantage of more artillery than the galleys.

### HMS Prince (1670)

![HMS Prince](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hmsprince.gif)

This 1670 first-class ship of the line became the flagship of the Royal Navy fleet after the disappearance of the **HMS Sovereign of the Seas**. She carried about 96 guns (nominally 100) and was classified as a three-decker (3 complete artillery decks, one more open half deck). Black was at the time the most used color as the official livery of Royal Navy ships. The decoration however more sober than that of contemporary French ships of Louis XIV.  
The HMS Prince was built by Phineas Pett the Younger, at Deptford Dockyard, and launched in 1670. During the Third Anglo-Dutch War she acted as a flagship for Lord Duke of York (later James II). She was found again in action during the Battle of Solebay (1672), right in the centre of the English center, attacked by the Dutch core led by Admiral **Michiel de Ruyter**. HMS Prince was heavily damaged by the **De Zeven Provinciën** in a two hours epic duel. Captain Sir John Cox was killed on board (head of the fleet as well). The Duke of York was forced to leave the board and raise his flag to HMS St Michael, under captain John Narborough.

HMS Prince was repaired and eventually completely rebuilt by Robert Lee at Chatham Dockyard in 1692, renamed **HMS Royal William**. During the **War of the Grand Alliance** she also fought at the **Battle of Barfleur** of 19 May 1692 against the French. HMS Prince was part of red squadron, flagship of Rear Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell, and first ship to break the French line.

She was rebuilt a second time by John Naish, Portsmouth in 1714, launched again on 3 September 1719 and renamed Royal Williams. However she saw no service and eventually was reduced to a 84-gun Second rate ship in 1756 (it is not precised if this was as a Razee). In 1757, she was part in an ill-fated expedition against Rochefort under admiral Sir Edward Hawke. But she forced Île-d’Aix’s garrison to surrender. The next year under Boscawen and Wolfe she attacked the French Fortress of Louisbourg in Nova Scotia, duelling with a French squadron. In 1758, she returned to Canada under Captain Hugh Pigot to for the campaign against Quebec. After the **Battle of the Plains of Abraham** and fall of the French capital of Nouvelle France, she was back to England with the body of General Wolfe. In 1760, **HMS Royal William** she became Admiral Boscawen’s flagship, heading the fleet in Quiberon Bay but was damaged after a severe gale, forced to return. But she was part later in the expedition against Belle Île in 1761, and patrolling the coast of Britanny. She fought also during the Seven Years’ War but was broken up in 1813. By that time she was 143 years old ! …

## Mediterranean Ships

### Sakouleiva

![](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/lumempire/sacoleve.GIF)  
_Reconstitution of a Greek Sakouleiva_

Known originally as the Saccoleva in Italian and Sacolève in French, but derived from _Sakouleiva_ in its original Greek, she was a low tonnage decked vessel, a wide coaster (15 meters by 5 for the largest) with a curved bow, narrow saffron rudder, while the deck and the freeboard are so low and smoothed that it is necessary to raise a pavise to prevent the sea from invading the deck and hold. The Sakouleiva is a fast and large-capacity merchant ship for its size, widely used from the beginning of the 17th century, resulting from the synthesis of different types of Western and Arabic types, with quite unique features, such as the leaning front mast, jibs on a bowsprit, the combination of Latin and square sails, as well as a livarde (as the illustration above).

The serration patterns of the bow and stern are also recurrent features. During the eighteenth century, this type of ship became widespread with combinations of rigs from Bricks, schooners, and are sometimes called Kalandiccios or barges. The first Sakouleivas were small and fatty (8 meters by 3), and equipped with a single sail on livarde and a jib rigged on an outer spar, with one or two masts, the one of the back bearing a Latin sail. Other more important Sakouleivas, ranging from 10 to 12 meters to 4 ratio, wore two lug sails and were often called runners (“trikandiris”).

### Late Galleys:

![La Liberte](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/la_liberte.jpg)  
_La Liberté, (‘Freedom’), reconstitution of a galley of Lake Geneva in the seventeenth century. Realized through a job reintegration project by jobseekers, the project, designed by Jean Pierre Hirt, was self-financed by the tourist receipts generated on the site and by the canton. It is currently a cruise ship equipped for navigations of several days and the only replica of a galley of this time and this size._

The post-renaissance galley, from the 17th to the end of the 18th century, has finally evolved little if not generated sailing and successful derivatives like the Xebecs, Polacres, Tartanes … The galère tardive from the beginning of the seventeenth century reached its characteristics and definitive forms, resulting from hundreds of years of empiricism for a typological genus dating back to the Bronze Age… The current galley was necessarily propelled by a single row of oars Manned by several men, generally 3 or 4, 5 to 7 for the largest, swimming called “a scaloccio”.

The Venetians were indeed the builders of reference galley in the Mediterranean, competing with the Genoese. Since the Crusades they dominated the maritime trade with the Orient. The commercial and military galleys had many points in common. Specific military variants were derived from the Byzantine Dromons, themselves from Liburnae of the Roman Empire. The Venetians created a type of galley derived heavy galley, Galeasses, which proved its effectiveness to Lepanto and drifted in Galion, itself ancestor of the ships of the XVII-XVIII centuries. That is to say, the galley has had a major impact on Western maritime history.

The great nations of that time, which had a façade in the Mediterranean, but also, and more surprisingly for the general public, in the Baltic and on Lake Geneva, all had galleys in the eighteenth century. We can mention Spain, Italy (the city-states and the Italian Kingdom), France, the Ottoman Empire, the Moorish and “Barbary” the Russians (in the Black Sea as in the Baltic), the Swedes, the Cantons Swiss…

The galley and even its derivative apparently more “marine” Galeazza of the great Armada were not suitable for navigation in the Atlantic and in the sleeve as evidenced by the defeat of the invincible Armada (more due to navigation on return only to the battle itself). In the Mediterranean they had reached by the end of the seventeenth century a kind of unsurpassable perfection in terms of shell shapes, fully drawn, dictated, by the empiricism of speed, and widely copied, as its organization of swimming, the wing, large and simple to brew, only its armament and equipment, excellent tactical compromise.

Unlike galeasses and derivatives, galleys could appear as under armed. But it was not so. In fact they could not align a large flank edge, but only hunting and possibly retreat. This artillery was therefore 3 to 7 heavy pieces, often of decreasing size, and scythes and other hand-held guns mounted on freeboard bases, especially at the level of the rear and front galleries, sketches of fellows serving as platforms.

The Venetian galley, the model copied later, is typical: It is low, its hull is narrow and finely drawn, it is very wide at the level of the talar (the double), a little like the modern aircraft carriers, with a wide central footbridge, which allows, like the ancient galleys Athenian, mass on the bridge many fighters, arquebusiers in the majority, which compensates for their relative lack of firepower. The chiourme is in the open air. We do not care much about its comfort in some marines, as in France where it is about convicts.

The spur has lost its traditional use and is now an ornament that also has a protective function of the bow, and a support and extension of the pointed bow, intangible characteristic. The hull at the front therefore has entries much finer than galleons and vessels, which explains its success. A sail alone, it is indeed in high winds more efficient and faster than a three-masted fully rigged as the Caraque or the Nave. Its classic Latin rig, which takes the crosswind, is also easier to rig despite its size, more versatile and efficient in all weathers. For heavy ships, the galleys serve as greyhounds of the seas. But the number of rowers required is a hindrance to their exploitation, hence the derivatives such as chébec and polacre.

Their typology was established between Galères usual (50 meters (47 hull alone), 255 rowers on 51 benches (one less on the port side to build the fougon, the kitchen on board), Patronnes (one rower more, or 5 or even 6, see the Dauphine), and La Réale, a giant galley of prestige, like the famous reed of Louis XIV, the latter with 7 oarsmen by rowing, 16 meters long and nearly 500 men on board was described as “extraordinary “Like the bosses, these giant galleys of nearly 70 meters had a symbolic and honorific value more than military.

But this perfection should not hide the fact that the galley had entered into a slow decadence at the beginning of the 17th century … Indeed, the galleon became a serious competitor. Almost as fast (at least for the first, from the galeas but much more veiled), they had a far superior firepower, a carriage and a versatility beyond measure, especially because of their ocean capabilities. However the galley retained its main advantage, that of passing the uncertain wind in closed seas like the Mediterranean.

The last actions of the galleys were the work of the Russians against the Ottomans in Chesma in 1770, the Russo-Swedish war of 1790 in the Baltic Sea where the famous “frigates of the archipelago” of Chapman, the seat of the Valetta by Napoleon and the defense of the Knights of Malta in 1798. They then became more prestigious and ceremonial ships, like the Venetian Bucintoro, losing all military value in the West. It is noted, however, that the Turkish fleet still had a dozen anchored in Istanbul in 1927

### Réale de France

**Louis XIV admiral galley of the French Mediterranean Fleet**  
![Reale de France](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/renaissance/lareale.gif)

The fleet of French galleys from the Louis XIV era reached its apogee with this ship. Formerly as important as the Venetian and Genoese fleets, the French Mediterranean galley force consisted of about a hundred ships, floating prisons, with a warlike role, gradually blunted since the appearance of the galleon.

Louis XIV was to be present on all fronts, as the larger, most populated, richest of the great powers of the time, it relied on Colbert’s ships for its Atlantic facade. The Soleil Royal, her admiral ship, was one of the most illustrious representatives, but in the Mediterranean the Reale of France was its equivalent.

The “Sun King” wanted his “mare nostrum”. To do this, a type of galley of high rank was created, the “Reale”, which remains one of the most sumptuous floating objects. With 33 and 34 oars on respective sides, for 6 or 7 rowers each, it had on board a total of about 600 rowers, including those kept “in reserve” in the lower deck.

There was in addition a musketeer guard of 100 men, about twenty gunners, fifty sailors, not counting officers and lackeys. Altogether, nearly 800 men found a place on this monster, more than 65 meters long by 12 meters wide (without rows). The reale carried six cannon stacked at the front, and two in its stern. It was rather a parade ship than a warship, lacking agility at sea.

### Bucintoro

![Bucintoro](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/renaissance/bucintoro50.gif)

### Boom

### Felouque

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/felouque.gif)  
Felucca of Provence fishing, in the eighteenth century.

Called modern French felucca (formerly falque), but known first under its name Arab fâluka, it is also known as Feluca, Falua, and Faluca respectively in Italy, Portugal and Spain who used it. The original ship, the felucca of the nile, is a derivative of the ancient Egyptian barges, especially those that carried the blocks of stone of the great monuments. It is therefore an offspring of a very old ship whose fundamentals have hardly changed, except that the offshore felucca has a much thinner and narrower hull, a sail and a saffron less imposing, but it remains in principle unbridged (if not in front). It is a very simple transport ship, rigged Latin (triangular) for the non-Arab versions and seti (quadrangular) for the others. The Faluka of the Nile is very different, it is related to the Gayassa, treated here. It will be the subject of an article in the middle-age section.

The “Western” Felucca are from coastal Arab feluccas, especially those used by Barbary pirates. It is as fast indeed as the chebec, more manageable, and also rowing. It can be hoisted to the ground easily because of its reduced size. A Provencal felucca (illustration) for example, hardly exceeds 7 meters. It is a large boat in the form of galleys, common to the oaks, tartans, polacres, and naturally the galleys. Its very rudimentary rig is easy to maneuver and the crew can be reduced to two men, see one for the one-part version, the most common among the Provencal feluccas.

The latter, however, rig a jib on the bowsprit. Although capable of facing the open sea, these boats were used for coastal transport, liaison, unloading and fishing. The trap fishery was its most famous use. She left memories (she began to slowly disappear in the early 20th century), and a local name in the var. The traps were more generally “fishing farms” granted by the King to a local lord, privileges and taxes in return for the treasure attached to it. Compelling for sailors, it was banned in 1851 but three remained in 1894.

The trap was also the fixed net (anchored to the bottom) used for this fishing, usually several were stretched between the boats that tightened the vise until catching the bluefin tuna hook in the few square meters of the “death chamber” “(matanza in Italian). This type of fishing was practiced already in the time of the Phoenicians, then the Greeks, and by extension the Greek colonists Phocaea (Marseille).

The Provencal term Madrago is of the same root as the terms matador, Baton and Matamore. Felucca was used to transport the nets, and eventually tuna on their return. The Corsican Felucca was quite close to the Provençal, except that the bow was higher than the stern and it has no guiber. The Sicilian Faluca is quite close to Corsica. Tunisians also practice this fishery, inherited from the Carthaginians during the summer migrations.

### Baghla

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/baghala2.gif)

Also called Baghla, or written Baggalah, this type of very classic Boutre was among the greatest. With two masts with a large airfoil, they were mainly heavy cargo ships (250-500 tons), with a western-style stern-sized quarter-deck, but some were used by Barbary pirates in the 18th century. Finer line, thanks to their large sails, they were quick. The one in the illustration below is an eighteenth-century pirate ship armed with 12 guns.

### Mediterranean Allege (XVIIe-XIXe Cent.)

![Allege Latine](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/allege_mediterraneene.gif)

The Allege “lighter” but we say today “feeder” was generally a small cargo ship destined to partly unload large merchant ships anchored and ferry them to river towns. They have the role of current “feeders”, mini-container carriers whose utility was to transfer loads of large container ships, which draft was incompatible with the harbor shallows.

The model seen above is from Arles, detached in Toulon. It was specific to this city, with a hull derived from the **Tartane**, a single mast, 15 m long by 5 wide (ratio of 3/1, typical of cargo ships), the Allege had a shallow draft and a flat bottom, because it was intended to go up the Rhone. The sheer was rather pronounced, as well as the high “guibre” for the docking of a bowsprit which was a polacca, precursor sail to the foresail. The largest Latin lighters had a small square topsail above their mainmast.

The bowsprit was transformed in the 19th century into a “boute-hors” (simple spar sail) and the polacca was transformed into a kind of great Genoese. The strong wing was a speed insurance in the relatively open conditions of the interior. Arles stones and timber were two of the most common loads of these ships.

### Dinghy

![Dinghy](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/images/divers/orientaux/dinghy.gif)

The Dinghy, before becoming the generic name of a small boat on board modern ships (akin to “youyou”), was one of the most widespread of the large Indian cargo ships. Also called Dhingi or Dingey, from “dingî” in Hindustani, it is a ship to bring Thoni closer, but the hull is smaller and lighter (no internal reinforcements), and decked but without forecastle.

Its rigging was complicated, mixing main and secondary masts, starboard bowsprit and removable port-side “tapecul”, foresail, livard sails, latine-setie and even marconi sails. The Dinghys originally sailed between Cuddalore and Bombay. Their shallow draft was offset by a large width, allowing them to anchor near beaches. They were fast, though with almost straight bow. Their average dimensions were 20 meters for 5.20 with 90 tons of payload. They were rather sober in decoration and bore only a small round figure at the head of the bow.

### Introduction

**Related Documents:** [[Expanded-Sailing-Ship-Types]], [[Expanded-Sailing-Combat]], [[Expanded-Sailing-Upgrades]]

A captain bellows orders to his crew as they struggle to control the sails against storm winds. A brig draws fascinated stares from children as it tacks through a harbor. A third-rate fully rigged ship fires its second broadside, and its crew cheers as the enemy ship begins to take on water.

Ships play a vital role in many worlds, enabling trade, exploration, and warfare. Adventurers often begin by bartering for passage aboard merchant vessels, but they may eventually wish to own a ship, using it as a mobile base for their exploits. Much like a castle or fiefdom, a ship provides opportunities for roleplay, development, and quests centered around protecting or expanding the ship's capabilities.

Owning a ship allows players to:

- Expand their focus to distant quests.
- Transform from local adventurers to national heroes.

### Procuring a Ship

**Tags:** #ship-acquisition #ship-costs #crew #cargo

**Related Documents:** [[Expanded-Sailing-Ship-Types]]

Per page 119 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_, adventurers may gain a ship during their campaign. Below are additional details about acquiring ships, costs, and considerations.

#### Purchasing Costs:

- **New Ships:** Costs include materials and labor, varying by location.
- **Second-Hand Ships:** Generally cheaper but may have drawbacks.
- **Player Participation:** Costs decrease based on the player's proficiency in relevant skills, at the DM’s discretion.

#### Crew:

The table under [[Expanded-Sailing-Ship-Types]] includes combat-ready crew numbers for each ship. Smaller crews can operate ships, but this limits combat efficiency.

#### Passengers & Cargo:

- Each ship's passenger capacity assumes a full crew; fewer crew allow for more passengers.
- Cargo capacity varies by ship type, detailed in the ship types table.

#### Damage Threshold:

Ships only take damage when it equals or exceeds their threshold. Damage below this value is ignored.

#### Ram Damage:

Ships deal and take specific damage when ramming. This varies by ship type.

### Ship Maneuvers and Player Actions

**Tags:** #ship-maneuvers #player-actions #ship-combat

**Related Documents:** [[Expanded-Sailing-Ship-Combat]], [[Expanded-Sailing-Player-Actions]]

This section expands on maneuvers that involve crew coordination and specific player actions during naval engagements.

#### Ship Maneuvers

1. **Fire Broadside:**
    
    - Ships fire their cannons in unison. The DM determines hits based on ship size. Damage is calculated per cannon multiplied by the number of hits.
    - Masts and rigging can be targeted, crippling the ship if damage equals 1/4 of its HP.
2. **Drop Anchor:**
    
    - This maneuver allows sharp turns at the cost of speed and potential damage to the ship.
    - Mechanics: Pilot rolls DC 14 Intelligence, and crew rolls DC 14 Strength. Success allows a sharp turn with reduced penalties.
3. **Ram Attack:**
    
    - A ship must spend an entire round moving directly at another to attempt ramming.
    - Mechanics: Opposed Dexterity rolls by pilots. The winner determines the ramming ship’s success and resulting damage.
4. **Furl/Unfurl Sails:**
    
    - Adjusting sails changes speed and maneuverability, requiring a DC 14 Dexterity roll by the crew. Failure delays effects.

#### Player Actions in Naval Combat

Players may perform individual actions, working independently of the ship’s maneuvers. Examples include:

1. **Attack:**
    
    - Players can attack enemy crew using ranged weapons or spells. Ordinary crew are treated as bandits; specific NPCs use stat blocks as assigned by the DM.
2. **Command Crew:**
    
    - The captain or other leaders issue commands to grant bonuses to crew rolls. The bonus equals the character’s Charisma modifier.
3. **Fire Cannons:**
    
    - Players may take control of specific cannons, rolling for damage on successful hits. Swivel guns and chasers can also be manned by players.
4. **Repel Boarders:**
    
    - Players can focus on removing enemy grapples or directly attacking boarding parties.

# [Medieval Ships](https://naval-encyclopedia.com/medieval-ships.php)

## Medieval ships: Transition and influences

The medieval era devoted to the maritime scene the emergence of new techniques of construction and navigation, mainly from the North, with imports from the east (Arabs, and indirectly Chinese). This will result in a dialogue of several centuries between the Mediterranean and these various influences. On the one hand, there is the technical excellence of the Scandinavians, who will bring to the design of the ships a real empirical talent for hydrodynamics and construction with clinker, more solid.

On the other hand, in the Mediterranean, the work of the **Byzantines**, which took over the great fleets of galleys and took them to the Renaissance. Genoese and Venetians will become specialists, employing them for unexpected roles such as trade, siege or transport of troops. When the Arabs, who were “fallers” of the Byzantines later, they went to import the Chinese inventions (Compass, gunpowder, axial rudder…) and revolutionized European navigation in their turn.

Galleys then began a slow decline, which ended in the eighteenth century. Curiously the last galleys battle will not take place in the Mediterranean, but in the Baltic Sea, between the Swedes and Russians. The galleys had meaning only in enclosed seas. When oceanic navigation reached the ultimate degree of perfection, galleys definitely disappeared, their advantages no longer compensating for their heavy inconveniences. They found however an inheritance in many sail-only vessels (like the Xebec, Polacca…), which thrived until the late XIXth Century.

![Knorr](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Modell_Knorr.jpg)

The Middle Age also sees the heavy Corbitas, Roman era cargo ships, having a sort of offspring in the form of a marriage between this type of ship with heavy load and the excellent marine qualities of the Drakkars, which will give the Cog and the Nava, Then the Hulk, a massively reinforced nava, ancestor of the carrack. The Ships, like those depicted on innumerable coins or as a symbol, were undoubtedly the emblematic ships of Europeans of that period.

Navas, Cogs and Hulks will dominate the “Mar Antiqua” and spread throughout Europe from the year 800, taking us until the fifteenth century with the reign of the Carracks and Carwels of the great European explorers.

## British Roundship

![Round Ship Matthew](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/matthew.gif)  
This Northern Caravel was a type of evolved British Round Ship, 3/1 wide (three widths for a length). It had to be around 35 meters for 12 meters wide at the waterline, with 3 decks, and of clinker construction (overlapping riveted planks), all in oak. Its rigging integrated a main sail, upper sail, bowsprit with civadier typical of late medieval Cogs and latin sail on its rear mast. Recent reconstruction of a discovery ship in Bristol sailed by John Cabot in 1497 from Bristol to North America.

## Clinker

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/clinquart.jpg)  
The Clinker was another name for the Cog (In French and English), Kogghe (in Batavian), Koggen (in German) or “Coque”, from the Spanish Coca or Cocha, or Concha in Latin, Coccha in Venetian. This was typical of the versatile cargo ships of northern Europe between the early Middle Ages and the era of great discoveries, although this type later coincided with the nava, more typical of the Lateen-rigged cargo ships. The clinker kogge was the first and most emblematic of these northern ships.

It was not created as an imitation of the nava but rather a derivative of the Scandinavian cargo ships, lined with clinkers, while in the Mediterranean freeboard construction, as in the past, Predominated. The Kogge was above all a functional, very large and belly-ish cargo ship: 3 to 1 ratio, rarely more than 30 meters long and 150 tons. She possessed only one mast, but in the fifteenth century two or three, before turning into a carrack.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Pintle_and_gudgeon_rudder_system_scheme.svg/751px-Pintle_and_gudgeon_rudder_system_scheme.svg.png)  
Classical kogges primarily used primarily in the Baltic by the rich merchant cities of the Hanseatic League united in 1241, were built in oak with ash couples, and with a deck clearing a large hold. Their slowness was to be Compensated by better management of the hold, well-closed bilge panels to avoid flooding, and a single sail. The small bow mast, served only to to suspend a small square sail for harbour duties. The hull was often reinforced by transverse beams, like those showed here.

Quickly adopted by the British who also produced a local version of the nava, the Roundhip Cog had a raised platform for archers and a small front forehead almost always rectangular. The stern post was almost straight, supporting a large rudder with straight bar, the transverse lever system only appearing much later. The hull was quickly adopted in the Mediterranean, with local constructions, such as the freeboard, and a rounded bow instead of right. In fact they were almost identical to the naves. This ship dominated trade waterways for three centuries as an all-purpose do-it-all ship, evolving by first adopting a mizzen carrying a Lateen sail on the quarter-deck and then a short bowsprit carrying a small square sail. From the Clinker derives the Hulk, and then the carrack, the classical XV-XVIth Cent. large northern ship.

## Trade Nava

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nef_marchande.gif)  
The Trade Nava was well used in the medieval period, in the Mediterranean, strongly influenced by the Byzantine cargo ships, from which she shared many characteristics, including the galley-type rear, tilted front mast and Lateen sails. The Franks made great use of it in the Mediterranean, also marrying square sails to this rigging. It was called “Nef Marchande”

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/snekkar.gif)  
Although less prestigious than the Dreki (from which derives “Drakkar”), Snekkars formed the bulk of the Scandinavian “Langskips”. The Snekkar (“Snake Ship”) is a very ancient Scandinavian term for distinguishing certain warships among Langskips. The name “snake” which by analogy to the Drakkar of the Western archaeologists will give the famous “Snekkar”, was a reference not peculiar to the figurehead but to the length of the ship or rather to its length/width ratio of 7/1 which Is the lowest of all Scandinavian vessels. Some wrecks discovered had an inferior ratio of 11/1. Such a ship was unstable and designed for pure speed. Therefore Snekkars were very fast warships. Their sails were much less developed than other Langskips as they had to be able to pull down the masts quickly, and propulsion by oar was practically default. Smaller ones (like this illustration above) were not decked and the frames rested on the keel rather than being embedded. Perfectly symmetrical, they were designed so that the helmsman could move his rowing from the rear to the front and the mast was in the center to balance the masses.

Snekkars were clinker-built (overlapped planks like on a roof), scandinavian-specific, but often from green pine, which gave them their great flexibility, or Oak (Like the Oseberg ships). Curved parts came from trees or branches in the desired shapes. Snekkars, known sagas, were probably the main ships of the Vikings from the ninth to the twelfth centuries. These are the ships of great invasions and raids, not the so-called “drakkars” which are mostly a posterior Western invention (although the term existed). Thanks to their large, tightened form, and almost flat bottom they could go virtually unimpeded on all rivers in Europe. On the other hand, they are not strong enough to face the high seas serenely in heavy weather, except the Langskips of the largest dimensions.

The Snekkars are divided into subclasses relating to their rowing numbers: The Tólfoeringr had 12 benches (24 oars), the Fimtánsessa 15 and the Tvitogsessa 20. The latter formed the majority of the Snekkars. The Snekkars were known and used by the Normans under the Latinized name of Esnèque or Seneca. The name was derived from Snekkja, which was borrowed from Snekjur. It was always Herkskips, “warships”. The shields rested on the Skjaldrim, a loose trim that increased buoyancy and protected spray while covering the oars and providing a tie to the shields. The latter could be placed simply consecutively or overlap to form the “shield wall” also used by the Vikings ashore.

## Dromon

![Dromon](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dromongd.gif)  
_Archetype of the Byzantine war ship, the Dromon ruled over the eastern Mediterranean until the fall of Constantinople._

The Dromon is the most famous Byzantine ship. This fast galley was indeed the standard of the fleet of the Eastern Roman Empire from 800 to 1300 AD. The name evoked speed, but the Dromon was also a general type, including other units. The one that remained under this name was large enough to be much sharper than the heavy Roman quinqueremes, and much faster thanks to the systematic adoption of multiple rowing lines (from 2 to 3 rowers by oar). In general, the Dromon, a bireme, was propelled by 80 oars (for the biggest ones like the one represented above, of 50 by 7 meters), and could total 240 rowers, not counting the 80 soldiers, archers, officers, and crew for ballistae and catapults.

The weapon of choice, which preserved the spur, was of course the Siphon, an archaic flame-thrower, composed of a tube thrusting the bronze lion’s mouth, projecting at large distances the famous Greek fire, a mixture of Tar, saltpetre, sulphur and crude oil that burned particularly well in contact with any surface, including water. Catapults launched incendiary “bombs”, “fire pots”, terracotta bottles filled with the same liquid, that can rain down a thousand meters around the ship. Sand and skins coated with vinegar were the only protections against these weapons. Moreover, the hull of the Dromons was often doubled in copper, in order to avoid the consequences of ramming, so these were also early ironclads. The Byzantine naval domination was also largely due to these ships, much improved over the centuries and soon at the origin of the whole range of specialized vessels, large and small.

## Portuguese Carrack: The Nao

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Nao-web.jpg)  
The Nao (lat. Nava) was the generic Portuguese name given to carracks, which were widely used alongside caravels to build the first colonial empire in 1415, extending from Africa to Asia. One of the most well known Nao was the Flor de la Mar (1501 or 1502) recorded in the “Roteiro de Malacca” register. Another famous Nao was the Sao Gabriel, Vasco de Gama’s flagship and the Victoria, Magellan’s ship. These solid ships married Latin and Nordic influences and were well suited to the Atlantic and long travels. Their construction required clinker assembly and reinforcing beams. They had large holds to store food, water, live animals, an iron worker, a millstone, glassware for barter with indigenous, but also weapons and gunpowder to show strength. Artillery however was overall modest (gun port had just been invented) consisting in a few heavy pieces and a large majority of smaller calibre breech-loading swivel guns and swivel-fixed arquebus in the castles. The idea was more to frighten and impress the locals than to fight against possible encounters at these latitudes.

## Dreki (Drakkar)

![Dreki](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/drakkaroseberg.gif)  
_Oseberg’s ship was very well preserved and is a masterpiece of shipbuilding, now an icon of Scandinavia._

The famous Dreki or “Dragon-ship”, is a romantic invention of nineteenth-century archaeologists probably inspired by the real “Snekkar” with a snake-shaped figurehead. In fact it’s a type of Langskip (“long ship”, the true raid type Viking ship) which appeared in the 8th century AD. Its ancestor, the Byrding, was assimilated to a boat without sails, which nevertheless possessed many of the langskip peculiarities. However, there was a common ancestor which was close to it, dating back to the 3rd century BC. Possibly the first clinker-built boat, with overlapping planking such as the tiles of a roof. This technique allowed a better strength in heavy seas and storms, frequent in these northern latitudes, but also ensured a greater impermeability. They had a lacing of couples in roots of spruce, giving them great flexibility. In this they inherited Neolithic skin boat.

Drakkars are basically large symmetrical boats, able to reverse quickly if needed, with low draft and flat bottom, but also often without decks. The mast, short and always single, was placed in the center of the ship, stuck in a bulge of the master-couple planted on the keel.

This mast could be dismantled for manoeuvrers, but at sea it was almost always sufficient for the propulsion as there was no shortage of wind. But this is especially the finesse of the ship’s lines that made her legendary: Bow and the stern are high and very narrow, even though the center of the ship is wide and with a low rounded section and flat bottom, giving this ship excellent stability but also excellent penetration and low drag.

The oars were manned by a single man in general, used mainly for river, bays and cabotage, where the shallow draft allowed them to go everywhere. It is often forgotten that these ships also traded a lot, therefore river cities (which abunded throughout Europe and Russia) were always capable to reach almost every of them, how deep inland they were, like Kiev (now in Ukraine).

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Vikingshipkils.jpg/385px-Vikingshipkils.jpg)  
_The strikingly handsome lines of the Oseberg ship are worthy of an art museum_

Contrary to a widespread idea, Drakkars did not systematically showed a Dragon head at their prow and/or stern, but more often a spiral, sacred symbol widely used graphically by Celtic and Scandinavian peoples. Their hulls were also often ornamented with patterns of the same order proper to the Drekis, the type of Langskips related to the Snekkar but generally much more decorated. The Oseberg boat was discovered in 1904 by a farmer from Oseberg, in the Vestfjold region.

The latter had in his field a tumulus containing a vessel well buried, probably belonging to Queen Åsa and her maidservant. She was exhumed and preserved byarchaeologists Gustavson and Shetelig. This was not the first exhumation of a medieval scandinavian ship, because others had been cleared as early as the seventeenth century. But the gorgeous ornamentation and perfect state of conservation were a first. So the Oseberg is technically a “Dreki” not a Drakkar/Drekkar. By the way, “Viking” is not a people but the adjective “raider” or “Vikingr”.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Osebergskipet-Detail.jpg/576px-Osebergskipet-Detail.jpg)  
_Details of the decoration_

As a Langskip, the Oseberg was rather short and wide (22 meters by 5) but was particularly unusual form was emblematic of the Dreki and Snekkars in general. Dated from 820 AD. JC. she was built of oak, with fifteen benches, probably for 30 rowers, which was not large. The mast was about 9 meters high and the sail was about 90 m2. She had to be able to sail at 10 knots just by wind power. The well-worked decorations of the stem piece (perhaps because the owner was a woman?) became classic examples of Norwegian pagan art. In truth, the Oseberg’s ship was so small she could also have been classed as a Karfi, a short variant of the classical Langskips like the Snekkars.

## Langskip Sud

![Sud](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/langskipgd.jpg)  
_The Sud was the summum of the largest Langskips, a late type for worlwide expeditions._

Langskips (restrospective translation of Latin “navis longa” meaning “long ship”) were elongated, fast and narrow war ships used by the Scandinavian peoples from the very beginning of antiquity (Hjortspring boat (400-300 BC)). The larger ones were classified as Snekkars, of which the Skeid and Busse (Bússa) were well-known types. Among the most famous of the ancient texts, the Ormen lange (long serpent), Busse of Olaf Tryggvason (King of Norway in 995-1000) was renowned with its 45 meters length and 68 rowers divided into two series of 34 row banks.

She was also known as high as a Knarr, characteristic of heay duty Busses. There was no doubt that these large fully decked ships had enough space for horses in their cavernous holds and large space for workshops, forges and all what necessary for long expeditions.

The illustration vessel, a large Sud, is an example of the largest Langskips ever built. Built in old Oak, with a crew of more than 170 men (including 154 rowers, mostly divided into double rows on a double set of 20 alternate oars), was equipped with grappling hooks and four anchors. The oars were so heavy that they were manoeuvred by two men each. This ship was about 50 meters long by 10 meters wide, which was still possible with the building techniques of the time used for Knarrs.

The **Gokstad** and **Skuldelev ships**, stronger than the Oseberg, were reconstructions of these great Langskips, the 24-meter-long Gaia and above all the Skuldelev 2, over 30 meters long as described by the Sagas, and restored by the Roskilde Museum team. The Sud was even more impressive.

But the Busse had between 40 and 70 rowers and a much lower freeboard but the Sud (Súð) described by Sagas had about 300 men on board. Such a figure indicates that they had to have about 70 oars with swim, which gives in analogy of 80 meters, which seems incompatible with techniques of construction of the time… We know however that at least two ships corresponded to this late typology well after Viking invasions era, in the thirteenth century, such a the Mariasuden and the Kristsuden (1262).

The latter, built by King Haakon Hakonsson, had 37 oars on each side, 74 in all, probably 148 rowers. The double, or even triple (220 rowers) double swim was induced by the length of the oars. Reported to the rest of the manoeuver crew and to any additional embarked warriors, these Langskips could actually approach the 300 men.

In any case, the largest Sud Kristsuden was described as having 37 sections, ca 52m according to the old measurement systems: Keel and lots were 74 so about 40.7m, but with the addition of the Stem, stern, bulkhead and decorative elements; ca 11.3 m more. The ships with 40 sections were 57m long.

## Byrding

![Byrding](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/byrding.jpg)  
Like most Viking boats tied in sagas, the Byrding is quite old difficult to date until a wreck is found. The Byrding was a smaller version of the Knarr, smaller even than the Karv, a merchant coastal vessel. It was narrower than the latter, and also shorter (an indication of size is given through record of it having between “10 and 15 rows” – spaces between the benches). Probably, its size should have been around 12-17 meters.

It was midway between the Karv, half-civilian half-military design, and the Knorr, a pure cargo boat. With large sails, these were thus considered very good walkers, fast, with straight bow and stern cutters.

This boat was also capable of deep-sea navigation over respectable distances, such as between Iceland and Norway. During the great military expeditions, they were probably used to carry everything that the great langskips could not carry like food and water. With Christianization and adoption of southern roundships, the Byrding began to disappear.

## Knärr

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/knarr.jpg)  
_The Knärr was essentially a small Scandinavian boat with most characteristic of standard Viking boats._

The Knärr or Knorr is the best known and most widespread of the Norwegian cargo ships (“Kaupskip”). It was characterized by dimensions rather short in length compared to Langskips but the ratio length/width was much higher (1/4 or even 1/3). Draft was also higher, and most of these were decked. The Knärr was devoted to carry various trading goods like walrus ivory, wool, furs and pelts, armour, and weapons or even slaves but also honey, timber or wheat.

The sail was therefore important for propulsion in comparison to rowing, mostly limited to manoeuvrers, and the rowing ports were often relegated to the rear and front, clearing the central part, where the load was placed on the the highest, longest Knorrs. The largest (about 20-30 meters long) fully decked received forecastles on both ends so that the passenger sheltering from the heavy weather do not share the middle deck with animals. A wreck of a Knarr known as “skuldelev” was found in the port of Roskilde, site of the famous museum, measuring 16,50 meters by 4,6. Its chords were much closer (80 cm for the Gokstad langskip and 74 cm for the Skuldelev Knarr).

Construction remained close to Langskips, but much stronger. Often Knarrs had a straight stem and stern, and a lower sailboard nailed rather than knotted. Framing was also thicker. Knarrs were reputed to be good long range seafaring ships, able to follow trade routes from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean since descriptions of these ships are reported by Arab merchants.

This type of ship was essential to the great Viking explorations, allowing colonies to be founded in Ireland, England (York), Russia (Novgorod), Iceland, and at the time of Erik the Red, south-eastern Grönland. His son Leiv Eriksson, had a fleet of these ships that landed in Canada (founding a small colony of Helluland, Baffin Island, Marksland on the Labrador Coast, and Vinland in Newfoundland) when accidentally attempting to reach Greenland nearly 500 years before Columbus. Knarrs used for these expeditions as described by sagas were tall, with up to 35 rower, sub-types known as the Grønlandsknarr and Vinlandsknarr.

## Moras

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mora.gif)  
_Very colorful, the Moras were related to the Scandinavian Langskips._

The “Mora” is the name given to the name and place of the place of conversion and acceptance of the sovereignty of the King of France by Rollon, Viking. With him, and his successors, Scandinavian shipbuilding was married with Frankish techniques. Thus, the Norman boats were characterized by certain similarities to the Scandinavian Langskips, including the Lion or Dragon head, the folding central mast, the fixed steering rudders, but also a specific construction profile, taller, wider and stronger to carry cavalry.

They were judged to be more stable but slower. They were also perfect for carrying a cavalry,the strong point of the Norman army. Their average size ranged between 12 and 24 meters and they could carry 20 to 30 rowers, who were also warriors. In 1066, **William the Conqueror** built several hundred of these ships (nearly 900) to disembark his 15,000 warriors on the coasts of Great Britain. This episode and the ships he built are very well known to us through the very long tapestry of Bayeux, which shows of the very colorful Langskips.

## The Byzantine Navy

![Saracen ships against Crete](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Saracen_fleet_against_Crete.jpg)  
Byzantine manuscript of the eleventh century describing the invasion of Crete by the Saracens in 820

**HISTORY of the Byzantine fleet (324-1453):**  
The Byzantine Navy was born with the schism between the Roman Empire of the East and the West. At that date it was composed of the local Roman fleet in charge of the eastern Mediterranean, which had evolved since the decisive battle of Actium in 31 BC; giving the Roman Empire its full control of the “Roman lake”. The Roman fleet in 300 AD was a relatively light force destined for escort and piracy missions.

The bulk of his forces consisted of Liburnae, a fast and modest tonnage ship, whose specificity was to have double swims, like Illyrian pirate ships of the same name. They had evolved, moving to two rows of superimposed swimming, and had grown elongated and weighted significantly, while remaining very fast. Until the adoption of the redoubtable Greek fire, ballistae formed the bulk of embarked armament.

Having an open bridge, these galleys had only reduced troops. It was, in a sense, a return to the frail triremes whose speed and capacity of ramming supplemented the lack of combatants on board. These fleets were nevertheless under the direction of great admiral vessels, heirs of the fifth.

The only confrontation to which these fleets took part was the battle of the Hellespont in 324 AD between Constantine the Great and Licinius, won by the first in spite of lower forces, but better manoeuvred in the narrow defile of the Dardanelles, and allowing him to land his troops in Asia Minor in order to lead the final battle of Chrysopolis and become emperor undisputed.

As a result, the Byzantine fleet stationed at Mysene became the most powerful in the Mediterranean. The Roman empire of the West saw its naval forces quickly weakened by the indirect effects of the barbarian invasions (notably the lack of manpower and funds to maintain it, reserved for land-based clashes). A threat came from 420, that of Genseric, the Vandal king of Carthage, whose naval forces dominated the western Mediterranean.

A large expedition of more than 1100 ships and 100,000 men under Basiliscus failed sharply, putting the empire almost bankrupt, forcing it to a humiliating and very costly peace. The situation improved after the death of Genseric in 477.

The first uses of naval incendiary throwers dated from the confrontation between Admiral Marinus for the fleet of Emperor Anastasius I and his rebellious Magister Militum, Vitalian, which brought together a fleet of 200 ships in 513. It was not not in all likelihood of the siphons with Greek fire, but of another system precursor. It should be noted that the pots (amphorae filled with bitumen or inflamed pitch) were used from the Hellenistic period.

20 years later, Belisarius was sailing in North Africa with the head of 15 000 men transported by 500 **Ousiakos** with the support and the escort of 92 **Dromons**. The latter had become the spearhead of the Byzantine navy, which became the most powerful in the Mediterranean.

In 550 under Justinian, it crushed the Goths who had mastery over the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian Sea, and in 626 intercepted and destroyed the invading Avar fleet, which was preparing to cross the Bosphorus to lend a helping hand to the Goths. What followed was the siege of Constantinople, and the passage of the Sassanid Persian armies.

From 640 however, a new threat came with the advent of Arab Muslims in Syria and Egypt. The Arabs had access to the ports, ships and manuals of the local Byzantine fleets and copied their organization on the latter.

This threat resulted in a crushing defeat of the Byzantines at the battle of the masts in 655, which followed the capture of Cyprus. Byzantium lost most of its fleet, 500 ships. The years that followed were crucial for the survival of the empire. The Constantinople seat of 674 was raised by the use of a handful of buildings equipped with flame-throwing siphons, projecting the famous “Greek fire” or “Greek fire” whose nature remained a mystery for a long time.

![Greek Fire](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Greekfire-madridskylitzes1.jpg/640px-Greekfire-madridskylitzes1.jpg)  
_The “Greek fire” in action. It was undoubtedly the most amazing weapon of the Middle Ages_

This famous Greek fire was a highly flammable substance contained in a kind of large metallic “syringe” actuated by a Syphonarios. The latter, fighting on land, had their “portable” armament, a reduced version, but capable of projecting flames at more than ten meters. The naval version was much heavier and vast so as to have reserve, and a very long tube. The dromons that were equipped with it were called “Siphonophoros Dromon”; the tube passed through a dragon or lion’s mouth.

The Greek fire was able not only to fire the enemy ship, but also the water around it. Attempting to extinguish it with more water only exacerbated the fire. It was the best kept secret of the empire. Grenades filled with sharp points and this liquid were also projected by catapults, like incendiary bombs.  
These weapons and general quality but also the perfect organization of the navy, especially reorganized under Justinian II, allowed the Byzantine empire to survive the Muslim maelstrom.

![Byzantine spec ops - swimmers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Byzantinischer_Kampfschwimmer.jpg/640px-Byzantinischer_Kampfschwimmer.jpg)  
_Byzantine spec ops: Attack swimmers. Oppians Cynegetica: “Naumachia”_

In 718, a second siege of Constantinople failed, once again thanks to the Greek fire. A last great confrontation opposed in 747 the Byzantine fleet, though inferior in number, to the combined fleets of Syria and Alexandria of the Umayyad Caliphate. The victory ensued the naval mastery of the Eastern Mediterranean and was accompanied by very severe restrictions on Arab maritime trade.

Beginning in the 820s, the Byzantine navy slowly eroded. After 859, after a series of defeats, the Byzantines and Christians were on the defensive, and the Arabs had control of the sea. The Byzantine revival was to take place during the reign of Macedonian emperors, from 867 to 1056. Despite the loss of several thematic fleets in the Mediterranean, the Byzantine navy was going to try and partially succeed in the reconquest of the Mediterranean.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Galley.jpg)  
_Galley bearing the body of Saint John Chrysostomos to Constantinople._

One of the most famous episodes occurred when attempts were made to retake Crete, the advanced base of Muslim pirates in the Aegean Sea. No fewer than 20 Dromons escorting 64 Khelandions and 10 galleys were sailing towards the island in 949 with 4,000 men on board but failed, countered by the army of the Emirate of Crete. In 960, a new expedition led by **Nicephoros Phocas**, taking 100 Dromons, 200 Khelandions and 300 transports (Ousiakos, Hippagogue with 77,000 men, succeeded this time to disembark and crush the Muslim forces, and marked a decisive turning point.  
Thanks to this advanced base, the Byzantines succeeded in subjugating Cilicia, resuming Cyprus, and settling in the north of Syria on a solid line of defense, averting the Muslim peril in the eastern Mediterranean.

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dromon-10Cent-Tactica-Leo-VI-the-wise.jpg)  
_A Dromon of the tenth century, according to the manual Tactica of Leo VI the wise. The very fine spur of the front is nothing more than an ornament, the Latin sail and the orientation of the yards, the size and position of the masts would become a standard, the position of the “castles” before and on the flanks, intended to receive the siphon (at the front) of the smaller siphons on the flanks or of the light jet weapons._

The gallery at the back and the plating ending in two volutes to the antique is characteristic. The width is large, a central bridge is relatively spacious for the fighters, the rowers were a level below. the hull is not a large pontoon almost parallelepipedic like the old heavy antique galleys, but affects a marine and tapered form, inheritance of the pirates ships with a reduced draft.

This ship was the battle-horse of the Byzantines, and was copied as much by the Arabs as by the nascent Italian cities-Genoa and Venice, which improved them. They introduced the triple Scaloccio swim, and cannons into the forecastle. There is no evidence that the Byzantines belatedly adopted cannons on their galleys…

![Siege of Constantinople](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/PriseDeConstantinople1204PalmaLeJeune.JPG/707px-PriseDeConstantinople1204PalmaLeJeune.JPG)

It was undoubtedly the last glorious ages of the navy. Under the Comnenes, in the eleventh century, lack of consideration, funds, competent officers, corruption and negligence, she was no more than the shadow of herself. It was deplorable that it was limited to the transport of goods, avoiding fighting if possible.

If the Arab threat had passed, a new power in the west threatened the Byzantine naval dominance in the Mediterranean, that of the Nromands installed in Sicily. The latter attempted to invade Greece but were held at bay by the Venetian fleet then in full swing, generously funded by a Byzantine empire on the brink of ruin. The exclusive commercial agreements between the Serenissima and Constantinople were the starting point of the Venetian naval dominance, a veritable thalassocracy.

**Alexis Comnene**, however, attempted to trace a modest fleet that was plainly effective, which he bequeathed to John II, who took care of it without strengthening it. the land army had priority, as in the rest of imperial history. Manuel I was more ambitious and succeeded in rebuilding a powerful fleet.

With this instrument of naval projection in the modern sense of the word, he built a real amphibious fleet which in his time was the admiration of William of Tire. Several operations were launched. Corfu and several Ionian islands in the hands of the Normans were taken over by a fleet of 500 galleys and 1000 transports in 1148. In 1155 another expedition allowed the Byzantines to regain their footing in southern Italy.

In 1169 another expedition was launched by Andronicus Kontostephanos in coordination with the King of Jerusalem, mobilizing 20 large Chelles carrying siege weapons to resume footing in Egypt, 60 chellers transporting horses and 150 Dromones. Despite the impressive device, the invasion failed and a large part of the fleet was annihilated in the heavy weather on the way back. The last expeditions in 1171 against the Venetian fleet of chios, and against Egypt in 1177, failed, and again the Byzantine navy was in decline, bound up with the rise of piracy.

Siege of Chandrax by Nicephoros Phocas

Under the dynasty of the Angeloi, the fleet struggled to reunite a hundred galleys to launch various operations of reconquest. From 1185 to 1196, all these operations were rarely crowned with success. The finances were such that in 1196, only about thirty galleys were able to survive. In fact, the Venetians had mastery over the sea.

Venetian and Genoese galleys were also rented at the price of new commercial exclusives. Under the Palaeologists, efforts were again concentrated on the navy, which never reached the previous level. The only recorded success was the reconquest of a few islands from the Aegean sea to the Latin. The bulk of the fleet, which reached nearly 80 ships in its paroxysm, consisted of private galleys operating under the Byzantine colors. A “naval mercenary” often of Genoese origin, the traditional enemies of the Venetians.

From Byronikos II Paeologus, in 1282, the Byzantine fleet was considered expensive and was dissolved in favor of the punctual rental of Genoese galleys. But it was insufficient in the face of the growing power of the Turks.

![Sack of Thessalonika](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Sack_of_Thessalonica_by_Arabs%2C_904.png/640px-Sack_of_Thessalonica_by_Arabs%2C_904.png)

Sack of Thessalonika by the Arabs

His little son Andronikos III attempted to rebuild the fleet in 1330, but it did not exceed 200 buildings, mostly mixed (merchants). During the civil war of 1341-47 the fleet took an important part of the operations, and John VI Kantakouzenos was not more fortunate to reconstitute a fleet, built elsewhere in Venice.

A naval battle combined with the Venetians against Genoa was another sharp failure. From then on, the Byzantine “fleet” comprised only a handful of galleys. It was of no help during the Turkish siege of Constantinople in 1453…

#### Ships Organisation

The sometimes dubious and divergent sources on the Byzantine navy do not allow a clear and reliable description of the Byzantine fleet. It is towards 911 that it is best described. It is at this time that it is experiencing its strongest growth, with nearly 34200 rowers for about 4000 “marines”.

![Saracen fleet against Crete](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Saracen_fleet_against_Crete.jpg/640px-Saracen_fleet_against_Crete.jpg)

Saracen fleet against Crete

The latter are troops embarked by trade, “Tagmata” very trained and efficient. In the ancient tradition, rowers were not slaves, but free men of low social status, spared, trained, and touching the pay. For the Crest expedition, the fleet consisted of nearly 300 ships. But the composition of these fleets was varied, and some of these ships, more fit for transport than for war.

The local fleets were organized in Themes, like the army, and were subordinate to them. They were commanded by a Drungarios, assisted by two imperial officials, in charge of the Thematic administration. The protomandator was the commander-in-chief, right arm and military career, assisting the Droungarios, often appointed by the emperor. This Protomandator directed the Kometes or “Counts”, the subdivisions of the Theme or squadrons commanded by Tourmarches, and the squadrons by drungariokomes.

Each ship was commanded by a kentarchos (“centurion”). The crew itself was dissected according to the size of the vessels in units of about 110 men, the Ousiai. The rowers of the upper row were also equipped for combat and had to leave their oars in the event of a collision. The officers were Bandophoros or second, assisted by two protokaraboi, more or less equivalent to quarters-masters. The chief officer was the Proreus. There were also spacialists like the Siphonatores in charge of the flamethrowers.

Byzantine-Arab naval struggle

This organization ended with the reforms of Alexis Komnene, which dissolved the themes and unified the fleet. The hierarchy only included the Megas Doux, assisted by the Megas drungarios of the fleet, and later of Amiralios for the squadrons. Under Michel VIII Paleologue, a new reform was based on Greece itself, to equip a local fleet which was not of foreign composition (Geno-Venetian).

The “Marines” were a separate unit, composed of “Tzakones”, “Lakones”, and “Gasmouloi”. The rowers were also grouped into “proselontes” units, all of them small landowners granted by the empire in exchange for their service, and stationed in Byzantine settlements.

The warships of the Byzantine navy were originally derived from the frail Roman Liburnes, “monoremes” having two rowers per side. The first Byzantine liburns were merely enlarged derivatives, but always with two rowers per bank. By shifting the benches and adding a third rower, these vessels evolved into galleys with two rows of oars, the famous “Dromons”, which spearheaded the Byzantine navy.

They were described as heavier and bigger than the liburnes, and much faster and more agile than the old quinqueremis. They formed the basis of the future Italian and Arab galleys in the Mediterranean. The Dromons remained open-bridge ships, and consequently their troops were limited. On the other hand, the upper rowers were equipped to take part in the collision fighting.

Liburnai and Dromoni formed the bulk of the fleet, the troops embarked by merchant ships requisitioned. The latter were small cargo ships sailing alone, and therefore tributary to the winds unlike the large military galleys. Being no more a sea people than the Romans, the Byzantines had moreover to face maritime losses as great by sea fortunes as in combat.

By 920-960 the Byzantine fleet reached its golden age, and the maximum of its development. In addition to the dromons, two other smaller galleys were set up to replace the Liburnoi, the Ousiakos, manned by 108 men, a “ousia”, hence their name, and the Pamphile, having 120-150 men on board. A derivative later made its appearance, the “Khelandion-Pamhpylos”, or Chelande-pamphyle of 200-250 men.

A new type of large warship had indeed appeared, the Chechen or Khelandion, much more armed than the Dromon, and having more than 300 men on board. These large galleys were also used for the transport of powerful jet weapons, and were used for sieges. Very modern “amphibious” derivatives appeared, like the “Thyreokhelandion” or khelandion with doors, true LST before the letter, since in their flanks they transported between rows of rowers, troops, equipment and horses for a campaign.

The galley ran aground on the sand from the front, and two flaps were simply opened at the prow. Lateral footbridges had also been developed for the Dromons, which also served as troop transports. The Ousiakos, literally “servants”, were small utilitarian galleys carrying all the supplies and were included in the convoy, arriving last when the area was taken and secured. Another type of amphibious ship which was developed, was known as “hippagoga”. The concept was soon adopted by the Crusaders.

the dromons were fully decked, with a Xylokastron or forecastle (lit. “wooden tower”), the top in which the siphon was mounted, and two lateral docks on which were added additional light siphons. This fellow was later kept on the galleys of the Middle Ages. The word “galley” was derived from the small “galea”, a _monoreme_ with only one rower per bench, used as a scout, liaison ship and despatcher.

These vessels were initially propelled by square sails, but gradually the Levantine sail appeared and supplanted it, giving the Latin sail, with mixed rigging that survived until the 19th century on derivatives of galleys like the polacre. Codes of tactics and manuals were long used as rferences, and were studied and translated by the Arabs. The use of flags and lanterns in order to pass orders was prescribed, a usage which persisted throughout the history of the sailing-ship.

Various tactics were established, but since the spur was no longer a weapon, but present as an ornament and protective element of the prow, naval battles were carried out in attempts to break the enemy line, with maneuvers, followed by shots, katapeltes firepots, and finally boarding. Although “Greek fire” is a scary weapon, it was not the decisive weapon expected: The siphons did not equip all ships and were only effective in calm weather and very short distances. More “classical” projectiles launched from mangonels (catapults) and Toxoballistrai (ballista), arrows, stones, lead blocks, tripoints (triboloi) were used more readily, according to some authors, snakes and scorpions in pots of terracotta…

The Byzantine Marines were experienced fighters, heavily equipped with lamellar cuirasses and armed with short pikes, sword, and javelins. It was a melee combat infantry, assisted by lightly armed rowers of the first rank and wearing cuirasses and leather caps, while sailors posted in the masts threw javelins, stones, and arrows. From these fights depended on the outcome of the battle…

#### So to simplify the nomenclature in the 10th century:

**Three main classes of bireme:** -The Dromon (crewed by two Ousias)  
In _De Ceremoniis_ mentions are made of the heavy dromōn carrying 230 rowers and 70 marines. Either supernumerary crews or for the second rower on each of the upper-bank oars.  
-The [chelandion] ousiakon ([χελάνδιον] οὑσιακόν) (as detailed in the inventories for the Cretan expeditions of 911 and 949) manned by an ousia of 108;  
-The [chelandion] pamphylon ([χελάνδιον] πάμφυλον) (120–160 men) possibly from Pamphylia or with “picked crews”

**Light ships**  
-The monērēs (μονήρης, “single-banked”) or galea (γαλέα, from which the term “galley” derives)  
60 men crew, inherited the antiquity small vessels, used for scouting missions and in the wings of the battle line.  
The galea was strongly associated with the Mardaites (Christos Makrypoulias)

**Super-Dromons:**  
Three-banked (“trireme”) dromons were rare. But they are described in a 9th-century work (parakoimōmenos Basil Lekapenos). The treatise draws heavily upon references on the Classical trireme however and must be taken with a pincer of salt. Their very existence is attested in the Fatimid navy in the 11th and 12th centuries, confirmed by Leo VI’s chronics about large Arab ships in the 10th century.

**Byzantine Cargos:**  
Transport ships (phortēgoi) were pressed into the fleet depending on the mission, as well as supply ships (skeuophora). These were sailing vessels related to the ancient Roman Corbita and Oneraria. Byzantines and Arab fleet also trusted tailor-made horse-transports called **hippagōga**, either sailing ships or galleys.

The **chelandia** appeared originally as oared horse-transports. So the hippagōga were seemingly between the chelandion and the dromōn. When the dromōn became a pure a war galley, the chelandion had a special compartment amidships to accommodate a row of horses. Itwas made therefore beamer and deeper.  
The **sandalos** or sandalion (σάνδαλος, σανδάλιον), was a boat carried along by the larger ships, towed at sea. In _De Ceremoniis_ it was described as having a single mast, four oars and a rudder.

# Pirate Sloop "Stormcrow"

The **Stormcrow** is a heavily modified **Bermuda sloop**, perfect for swift maneuvers, surprise attacks, and extended roving. This design takes advantage of historical modifications made by pirates to merchant sloops, transforming the ship into a formidable pirate vessel.

---



## **Overview**

|**Ship Type**|Modified Bermuda Sloop|
|---|---|
|**Length**|~50 ft|
|**Crew**|15–20 pirates|
|**Passenger Capacity**|5 additional passengers|
|**Cargo Capacity**|~40 tons|
|**Armament**|8 cannons (4 per side), 2 swivel guns at the bow|
|**Speed**|~16 mph under full sail|

The Stormcrow’s alterations allow it to outpace most naval vessels of similar size, with a balance of firepower, maneuverability, and resilience.

---

## **Modifications and Features**

### **Deck Adjustments**

- **Removed Aft Deck:**
    
    - The poop deck was removed, lowering the ship’s center of gravity.
    - A larger mainsail and extended boom increase speed and maneuverability.
    - The cleared aft allows for two additional stern-facing swivel guns to be installed, ideal for retreating engagements.
- **Reinforced Hull:**
    
    - Extra beams were added to critical weak points, particularly near the waterline and the bow, where ramming damage is likely to be taken.
    - The modifications ensure the sloop maintains seaworthiness during prolonged skirmishes.
- **Cleared Top Deck:**
    
    - All unnecessary walls and compartments below deck were removed, allowing pirates to move freely from bow to stern during engagements.
    - This increased mobility ensures a faster response during boarding actions or repelling attackers.

### **Rigging and Sails**

- **Shortened Mast:**
    
    - The mainmast was shortened slightly, improving stability in rough waters.
- **Extended Yard Arms:**
    
    - Yard arms were lengthened by two feet, allowing the sloop to carry larger sails without compromising balance.
- **Added Flying Jib:**
    
    - A flying jib was installed at the bow, further enhancing speed and allowing for tighter turns when tacking against the wind.

### **Armament Upgrades**

- **Gun Deck:**
    
    - The Stormcrow carries 8 medium cannons mounted on the main deck (4 on each side).
- **Swivel Guns:**
    
    - Two swivel guns at the bow are used for close-quarters engagements or targeting specific points of an enemy ship.
- **Hidden Compartments for Ammo:**
    
    - Below deck, hidden compartments store ammunition and powder, ensuring it remains dry and out of sight during inspections or surprise encounters.

### **Aesthetics**

- **Dark Hull with Storm Motif:**
    - The Stormcrow is painted a deep charcoal gray with streaks of lightning motifs along the sides, striking fear into those who see it on the horizon.
- **Jolly Roger Variant:**
    - The crew’s black flag depicts a crow perched on a skeletal hand, clutching a lightning bolt in its beak.

---

## **Advantages**

1. **Speed and Maneuverability:**
    
    - The lowered center of gravity and extended sail rigging make the Stormcrow faster than most ships of similar size, ideal for ambushes and retreats.
2. **Free Movement:**
    
    - The cleared decks allow the crew to move and respond quickly during combat or emergencies.
3. **Firepower:**
    
    - With broadside cannons and stern-mounted swivel guns, the sloop can engage from multiple angles.
4. **Intimidation Factor:**
    
    - Its dark design and fearsome flag often cause merchant crews to surrender without a fight.

---

## **Disadvantages**

1. **Limited Observation:**
    
    - The removal of the aft deck eliminates the high perch for observing distant ships.
    - Reliance on crew in the rigging for scouting adds potential risk.
2. **Weaker Structural Integrity:**
    
    - While reinforced, the modifications make the Stormcrow more susceptible to splintering in prolonged cannon exchanges.
3. **Smaller Cargo Capacity:**
    
    - Reduced from 50 tons to 40 tons to make room for additional weaponry and reinforcements.

---

## **Adventure Hooks**

1. **The Merchant’s Pursuit:**
    
    - A wealthy merchant’s daughter offers 5,000 gp for the capture of the Stormcrow and its captain, who seized her father’s prized shipment of magical goods.
2. **A Hidden Cargo:**
    
    - The Stormcrow’s hidden compartments contain a long-lost artifact. The adventurers must convince the pirate crew to let them search or risk combat.
3. **Rogue’s Mutiny:**
    
    - The crew mutinies against the captain, stranding them on a remote island. The adventurers encounter the divided pirates and must decide whom to aid.
4. **Careening and Repair:**
    
    - The Stormcrow is beached for hull cleaning. While careened, the crew is ambushed by a rival pirate gang, and the adventurers are caught in the crossfire.

## **Stat Block**

|**Feature**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|**AC**|16|
|**HP**|240|
|**Speed**|16 mph (under full sail)|
|**Damage Threshold**|10|
|**Ramming Damage**|4d8|
|**Crew Requirement**|15|
|**Upgrade Points**|2|

Lost in the mists of antiquity, what can we tell of the relations of man with water at the end of the Neolithic? One will probably never know how this story began. Although there are rare traces that date well before 10 000 years of men using canoes, mostly peoples of Central Asia and the Sahara, with a very different climate during the ice age.  
The caves of Tibesti contain scenes of hunting and fishing dating back to that time. Canoes were also found in the mud at random from excavations, also dating from the late Neolithic, and this throughout Europe.

All these indications suggest that the ship was “invented” in its simplest form possibly 50,000 years BC It was probably brought from Central Asia and the prosperous Indus basin, a possibility introduced by the Indian word “Batel”, which is found in Celt, and currently in “boa”, “boote”, “boat”…  
But it is mainly born out of necessity all over the world, in forms that vary according to the material More locally abundant, and the simplest (canoes and rafts) will still be built as long as forests exist.

It is undoubtedly the simplest and most widespread boat in the warm woodlands. It was also that of Europe in the glacial era, since the work of dismantling the foundations of the old louvers made it possible to unexpectedly uncover the oldest European craft, a canoe dating back 10,000 years, when the shores of The seine were game birds and hunting area of ​​the woolly mammoths who came to quench their thirst. The word “Pirogue” is not widely used (The English say “Dugout”, the Germans Piroge, the Latin Trinchera …).

The word French comes from “Piragua”, a word Guarani meaning literally “water that goes on the water”, the term date of the discovery of Christopher Columbus since it was found in all the Caribbean Indians. Boat-queen since an indefinite time in the great forests and the great rivers that are there, like the Amazon and its tributaries, but also the Zaire, the Zambezi, and many others around the equator, the Pirogue Embodies simplicity itself. Monoxyl craft (one piece), it is born from a hollow tree trunk; All the species do not lend themselves to it, far from it:

It was necessary at the same time a light, solid and non-porous boix, because the techniques of waterproofing of the hull did not exist, From “burning” to wood fire, or coating based on vegetable wax or sap. The canoe seen above is in Balsa, coated with sap heated by wood fire, which gives it its dark color. In Zaire one continues to dig trunks of mahogany, the Framiré, and especially the Iroko, whose lifetime (which was that of the canoe) when dried was 10 years. In North America, the canoes were built of red cedar, an immense and resistant tree. These great canoes were painted in bright colors. The shapes varied considerably according to the region, but in general, canoes made of tropical wood had limited sizes and a tapered shape, dictated by the empiricism of speed. The African canoes then drifted to a soft assembled type of wood consisting of three main parts: a flat bottom, two siding plates, and two sleepers. It is this type that is currently manufactured, especially throughout West Africa .

Two primitive European dugouts of the Neolithic

The oldest Pirogues were likely to resemble this one. It is indeed a boat in the most direct sense, because there is apparently no concern for hydrodynamics. Empiricism, however, begins to shape the front and back shapes, rather than keeping them cut clean, which undoubtedly resulted in a high resistance to water. The European Pirogues discovered and those which made the objects of archaeological reconstructions inform us about their technique of construction: A typical mesolithic canoe measured 6-8 meters by 50 centimeters, its weight could go from 250 to 750 kgs. And its section conformed perfectly to the shape of the trunk. The choice of a straight trunk was therefore important, especially as the knots were as many potential waterways. Softwoods were preferred because of a more impermeable wood and a lightness, as well as the ease of working it, without counting the straightness of the trunks, without knots over most of the barrel.

Probably a stone anchor (found with remains of canoes), and walked with the gaffe and the paddle. For their construction, cut flint adzes, corners, masses and wooden sticks were used, as were the bone and deer scissors, the wire to be drawn and a flint lighter with tinder for the method of Digging by burning. First, the top slice was marked on the sides (pre-cut with the chisel and measured with the wire), then the wooden sections of this slice were cut in V on the adze and then removed, Using wooden corners typed to the ground, or with a corner of deer wood. The trunk began to be hollowed out. The thickness was measured with an arc-shaped instrument, followed by burning finishes: the latter eliminated the splinters and treated the wood naturally against the pests. Finally, the waterproofing was done by a mixture of beeswax of vegetable fibers in hot on the cracks. The lower part was generally thicker, as was the central part of the stern and bow, to prevent the wood from splitting on drying.

A Polynesian outrigger canoe.

In the Pacific islands, the canoe has very specific characteristics: It is fine and flexible, made of the nature of the trees used, and generally higher than wide. It requires a balance to ensure its stability, the “float” being connected to the whole by light, solid and flexible woods (like bamboos). The solution of the catamaran (a Polynesian word) came from this concept, marrying the advantages of the raft and the finesse of canoe hulls. It has definitely established itself in the pacfic and is today the happiness of the racing sailors. There were three types of pirogues in Polynesia: the one for fishing, with a single or double pendulum, was distinguished between the small Va’a (the most widely used word for “Pirogue”), for fishing in lagoons, A Motu for inshore fishing, and the Va’a Tira for deep-sea fishing.

These were of catamaran type, and differentiated between Tipaerua, ranging from 13 to 25 meters, and sometimes double-sail, for passenger transport and inter-island commercial transport, and the Pahi, which was wider and longer , And made advantageous for expeditions, was often provided with 2 sails and maneuvered by 6 to 8 men. Finally the Pahi Tama’i were war catamarans, a little finer, without sails, and decorated in an aggressive and flamboyant way. They had in common a large central paddle, at the back of the raft formed on the two hulls, the “hoe”, a scoop, and an anchor in stone. Both the Tipaerua and the Pahi were considered by the Polynesians as their “fenua”, their territory, and bore the name of their lineage. When she landed on a virgin island, the latter took the name of the boat. We shall return to these latter vessels, which were not monoxylated and consequently move away from the subject.

The Umiak is a less known and popular boat than the kayak, but it is older and has long been more widespread. Spelled umiak, umiaq, umiac, oomiac or oomiak, the Umiak was called the “women’s ship” as opposed to the kayak, “man ship”. Slower, broader, higher in form, but also more complex and long to build, more material-intensive, the Umiak was propelled by paddle and sail, which, modest, was erected at the front.

Its hull used the same construction techniques as the kayak, but its architecture was different. Thus, the umiak was assembled by three large “spars” of driftwood, or possibly six solidly assembled, forming a central section in an inverted triangle. The two upper side beams were pushed back in the center and tightened at the front, giving Hydrodynamic line to a very old ship dictated by empiricism.

More stable than the kayak, it was nevertheless often weighted, and could carry all that the Eskimos could carry away during their displacement (they are often nomadic tribal societies, ranging from hunting area to hunting area, summer).

A umiak asked for no less than seven sealskins and more, was one meter fifty wide and sometimes 6 meters long and more. Only the size of the available driftwood dictated the size of the vessel. Couples were bone most often. The fittings between the skins were particularly well treated, the vessel serviced weekly. The hull coating changed every 2-3 years.

Beginning in the 1960s, the Eskimo civilization discovered among other things modern kayaks made of plastic or fiberglass and adopted them, but the aluminum umiak never really succeeded in implanting, because of its cost And the difficulty of maintaining and repairing it… The Yupik and Inupiat of Alaska in particular, continue to build traditional umiaks for their everyday life .

Description: Different types of coracles throughout the world. Above left, traditional Irish Curragh, representing a very long Celtic tradition. On the right, the Scandinavian Coracle, used by the Vikings mainly for river transport and lake fishing. Below left, Traditional Coracle of the Tiger (Iraq). On the right, Coracle in coconut fiber for South Vietnamese coastal fishing. Below: Coracle Indien. Left: Ku-Dru or Tibetan Kowa.

The name Coracle, also related to Curragh is of Gaelic origin, (cwrwgl). This is the composite basket boat used probably as early as the Stone Age on rivers and lakes around the world. Its size is above all dictated by the materials, its shape by the calm navigation of lakes and rivers rather than marine or even river. The basket-boat was made of skins sewn together and fastened with a wooden or bone structure, or both, so as to have a vaguely or precisely hemispherical shape. Very simple, with a flat bottom and without a keel, the Coracle required only wood of recovery of small size, and its surface could be covered by two or three skins sewn only. On the other hand, it required numerous tendons or twines for its attachments, and the skin had to be treated carefully, including its fittings. But the Coracle had a fairly good longevity because of its navigation in fresh water, salt water, compared to ships in marine skin like those of Eskimos, attacking and deteriorating leather.

The coracle was used in antiquity and known in this way, as an archaic lacustrine and river fishing vessel throughout northern europe. It existed in many versions, but most were light and single-seater. Its large size allowed the carrying of loads, it could easily be carried on the back of a man and was even used in battle as additional protection to the shields. On the other hand, its shape made it a stable vessel but slow and awkward, with an important inertia due to its shape. Coracles were built all over the world, in Persia, Mesopotamia, Viet-Nam, and North America.

_A “voyager”, a kind of large Amerindian Canoe of the XVIIIth Cent. The Britsh, Scottish but also in particular French trappeurs et coureurs des bois made these their main transportation system._

The Canoe is one of the best known traditional boats without sails, used at very old dates. It is often likened to the canoe, for it probably derives from the first canoes made of simply dug trunks. But the true canoe, a symbol of Native Americans, especially Canada, is truly unique in northern America. The classical canoe was made in the manner of the Eskimo ships of which it is probably an ancestor. It was made of wood and bark or skins sewn and bound, had solid shapes, a slightly raised front and a rear and a Which allowed it to move on all liquid surfaces, from rivers to the largest rivers, through lakes, rapids and torrents, and even coastal maritime areas. Rivers of Canada, great lakes, bays, were all ways of travel, which have always been an integral part of the life of the Americans, as well as European pioneers who adopted it as soon as they arrived. Derive the current canoes, were built entirely of wood and sometimes covered with linen, lined and resined to be impermeable, and provided with a keel for stability and solidity. Such canoes were able to face thanks to their solidity , Their suppleness, their stability, and their lightness, the most frightening rapids, even the cascades.

Pacific canoe

A reconstruction Photo of the Canoe of the Haida, a masterpiece of the know-how of the Indians of the Northwest Pacific. Excavated in 1878 in a trunk of cedar, this canoe of the Indians Haida testifies of what could be a “pirogue” in its most monumental versions. With 16 meters of length, it is one of the most beautiful examples preserved until today. This canoe was used for whaling. Profile reconstructed from photos of the museum of natural history, central park, 79th street in New York.

The composite canoe, made of wood and skin, dating back 4000-5000 years, was generally large enough for at least two people to embark, but many variants have emerged, the largest, built entirely or partially out of wood, Reaching twenty meters, such as the great canoes of war of the Indians of the great lakes. These canoes were brilliantly decorated at the prow and stern, very raised, large enough to carry 20 to 40 people. They were eventually carried on the back of a man, for the smaller ones there again thanks to their light composite structure. The biggest ones were drawn on the bank and returned to the shores. Passengers, trappers, and pioneers were thus able to travel great distances over the rivers, carrying their canoes, their affairs on their backs, and foot-passing non-negotiable falls. Many variants existed, but in general the sections of the ship married “Y” shapes at the front end, “U” at the center, and “V” halfway. Some had more flared sections in the center, others were more delicate and more unstable, especially war canoes, created to “intercept” those of transport. Their bow and their recessed muscles, the keel forming a real loop at its ends, was another of their immediately recognizable characteristics. Modern canoes have more pointed ends, even flat “boat” type.

The riverine heritage of the Amerindian peoples is quite rich, as shown by vivid colors and flamboyant decorations of their immense canoes, restored or preserved. This celebrity allowed this boat to cross the Atlantic and become a sport. In Europe it was known and used from the 18th century, brought back from the new world. French marine painter Gustave Caillebote made one of his favoutite sibjects in the XIXth century. Modern materials used for the construction of canoes are fiberglass, plastic (in particular Polyethylene, or Royalex), carbon fiber, kevlar, much more expensive, polyester, and even aliminium, which exhibited The major disadvantage of not being repairable and particularly noisy for the local fauna…

_  
Thör Eyerdhal in the seventies. He was, despite his disputed theories, a great experimental archaeology pioneer. Kon Tiki in Olso Museum._

Thör Eyerdahl, born in Norway in 1914 and died in 2002, was one of the great pioneers of a new form of science that has since flourished: Experimental Archeology. An ethnologist by training, he quickly became interested in the migratory movements of the peoples of the Pacific, studying Polynesians and South Americans. It was soon controversial for his theory that the South Pacific and Polynesia were colonized by South Americans, while the opinion gained in the scientific community was a colonization coming from South-East Asia. Today, we would proceed by taking samples and analyzes adn. At the time (1946), he had no other possibility to support his theory than to put it into practice by constructing a raft of trunks of balsa, built with smart and a prehistoric technique but whose know-how Was partially transmitted in some lacustrine production (to the Andean lake titicaca for example).

The Kon-Tiki (in reference to Con Tiki Viracocha, the sun god of the Incas) had a sail, a hut, and was just enough room for a crew of 6 men, researchers like him, enthusiastic about the idea project. Its financing is largely personal and on funds of scientific sponsorship, because the scientific community does not provide any assistance, even treating its project of smuggling and predicting a failure. However, after an epic film trip that lasted three months, it finally fails to the touamotu, becoming the day in the world-famous landemain (his work that describes the expedition participates greatly), but always met the skepticism of a major part of the The scientific community, whose researches will end in much later on.

Propagated on the international stage, Thör Eyerdahl now has all the necessary funds to continue his research in experimental archeology. After his excavation and research campaigns in the Galapagos and the Easter Island, he devoted himself to a new expedition, this time aimed at proving that the ancient Egyptians could have crossed the Atlantic and influence prehistoric Amerindian civilizations. The negroid face of an Olmec god, the graduated pyramids, in fact advocate for a valuable part of the historians the theory of a civilization at the origin of all others, probably based in the basin of the Indus, and then colonizing Mesopotamia and finally Egypt.

## Ancient science to the rescue

[![Renaissance ships posters](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/poster-renaissance-ships-web-768x543.jpg)](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/poster-renaissance-ships-web.jpg)

Renaissance ships [](https://www.redbubble.com/people/thecollectioner/works/38113718-poster-of-renaissance-ships?asc=u)

The Renaissance begins, according to most authors, in Italy, notably in Florence and Venice. In particular because the wealth of generous and enlightened merchants and Condotierres, bringing patronage to artists that took their inspiration and “rediscovered” classical antiquity. Called locally Rinascimento, it originated from the Trecento from the fourteenth century and gained the rest of Europe in the sixteenth century. Many date it from the fall of Constantinople in 1453, but ended at an unspecified time, some speaking of the death of Charles V in 1558. But it is especially a period marked by the great naval discoveries, maps creations, gunpowder, rudder and compass, and it is also the constitution great merchant and military empires.

On the purely naval side, we note the emergence of an emblematic vessel of that era, both building trade and war faster, the Galleon. It does not, strictly speaking, replace the Carrack, which is maintained at its side until the end of the sixteenth century. Carracks and galleons will be instruments of exploration and wealth for the Portuguese, the Spaniards and then the Dutch. This chapter also includes a transition ship of the modern age, which is no longer of the Renaissance, but classified here for convenience: The ship-of-the-line, ma-o-war, a truly military tallship and logical evolution of the Galleon. It was born at the beginning of the XVIIth century, and evolved constantly to find its culmination around 1840.

## Venetian Galley

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/triremevenitienne.gif)  
The Venetian military galley, heir to both the mighty Byzantine Dromons and the distant Roman Imperial Triremes, was one of the best examples of their evolution, at a time when the still-rising galleons had not eclipsed them. Compared to the carracks, which boasts a powerful artillery, the galleys are less armed but quicker, and independent of the wind.

Naval battles are always solved by boarding as in the past, but firearms give the embarked troops the possibility to engage the enemy at better ranges. The Galley presented here is already imposing, signaling itself as a command galle. It is a “trireme”, in the sense that it is given three rows of oars, but at the same level.

On the other hand, these oars are handled by three to four men each. It is the “a scaloccio”, rowing style, a term invented by the Italians in the Middle Ages but often used to describe antique swimming systems. The latter, with its 84 oars handled by 336 men, had in front a chasing cannon of large caliber (bombard), and four lighters pieces, sheltered inside the forecastle. To the ballistae have succeeded the lighter culverins on articulated side poles. Inevitably, the rigging is Latin, and most of the time on a single mast.

## Vasa

![Vasa](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vasa.gif)  
The Vasa is one of those great ships (they are no longer called galleons, but form a part of this family born at the beginning of the last century), which bore all the royal magnificence together with a formidable dissuasion power towards Sweden’s naturals foes, like Russia. In this case it was originally called the Nya Wassan, a large sailing ship of 1400 tons, with planned 1150 m2 of sail. The head of her mainmast culminated at 50 meters, for a full length of 66.50 m from the lantern of the stern table at the edge of the parrot’s hune.

She carried 133 crew and 300 soldiers and servants, for 64 bronze guns divided into forty-eight 24 pounders, eight 2 pounders, two one pounders, and six mortars. No less than 80 tons was disseminated on three decks, the lowest one being just 1.20 m above the waterline. She was built under personal instructions from King Gustav Adolf (who reigned from 1611 to 1632), then at war with Ferdinand II of Habsburg.

She was built and launched in 1627 in Blasieholmen Island, and completed in the spring of 1628, the ceremony having been celebrated with pomp. The king would have even said these words: “After God, it is the fleet that decides the prosperity of the Kingdom.” Still, the Nya Wassan was towed to the naval artillery dock not far from the palace of the three crowns (“Tre Kronor”).

There she had to be armed, receiving her artillery but also ballast and crew, basically to be prepared to join the fleet. On August 10, 1628, she began her first service voyage to join Alvsnabben (Stockholm Archipelago), where the rest of the fleet was anchored. The jubilant crowd was massed on the jetties to witness the departure of the famous and magnificent ship.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/The_Vasa_from_the_Bow.jpg/640px-The_Vasa_from_the_Bow.jpg)

The weather was beautiful, with a radiant sun, and the ship did not unfurl its sail until after being towed to Södermalm. Crewmates lowered the foresail, brigantine, great and the little topsail. A slight south-southeast breeze was then blowing. But after barely a mile, a sudden gust of wind drowned the ship, which rolled down to the level of the lower battery, the ports of which were wide open to gun salute the King. When the gust ceased, Vasa, far from straightening up, had pitch increasing until the water penetrated to the ports. Foreseeably she completely capsize in a few moments, its sails taking water, her holds filled very quickly.

She sank, for she had been heavily weighted to compensate for the weight of her artillery, in front of an incredulous public. This was nothing short of a national catastrophe: About fifty people were drowned, crew, artillerymen, But also officers and especially high-ranking officers of the Swedish Army who traveled with women and children… Since the ship cost was a whooping 100,000 Riksdaler (60 million Euros today), a commission of inquiry was convened as of the next day in order to decide on the responsibilities of each.

The boatswain, Jöran Matsson, who was the most seriously accused, defended himself with much conviction, and eventually convinced the jury that the ship had been too heavily loaded at the top and in his opinion – he was not an engineer or a naval carpenter – The hull was too narrow for her high profile. He confirmed the fact that during roll tests the ship had already behaved badly. When Hein Jacobsson, the final boatmaster of the ship, said that the final plans had been drawn on these precise specifications by the King himself…

The investigation also questioned the artillery intendant Erik Jönsson, Lieutenant Gierdsson, in charge of the rigging, and eventually the audience closed without clear responsibility. The Vasa could not be recovered, so teams did their best then to dismantle her large mast, which protruded from the water, in order to clear the navigation.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Vasa_stern_color_model.jpg/800px-Vasa_stern_color_model.jpg)

In 1664, a salvage operation by Hans A. Von Treileben was only partially carried out by sending divers to empty the contents of the vessel, including the 50 large bronze cannons. But the story does not end there: In 1956, a maritime archaeologist managed to trace the ship, buried under tons of mud.

This famous natural preservative, the Scandinavian mud, was considered acidic, antibacterial, and moreover woodworms, usual gravediggers and natural recyclers of hulls, did not support the icy waters of the Baltic. It was the miracle that made it possible to dig up valuable archaeological vestiges from the sea, such as the famous Vikings boats.

Four years of hard work was needed, financed largely by the government. Finally In 1961, the Vasa was removed practically intact from its muddy cradle… Only the paintings had disappeared.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Vasa_Top_Deck.jpg/640px-Vasa_Top_Deck.jpg)

Archaeologist Anders Franzén found the trace later with pigments encrusted in the veins of the wood and a colored reconsititution was done. The Vasa hull was carefully washed and treated with polyethylene glycol. A hangar was quickly built to completely isolate her from the outside, which became the temporary museum of Djugarten in Stockholm.

She is now the Vasamuseet, a large building which besides the ship, also hold nine exhibitions dedicated to the 14,000 intact wooden objects recovered in the ship and notably its extra sails, the only ones recovered from that time in the world. The Vasa is currently one of the most popular attractions in Sweden, and its visit is essential for going through Stockholm. The Vasa became invaluable for the knowledge of the techniques of the time, and many posterior reconstructions rely heavily on studies made out of her.

## Odam

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/odam.gif)  
The Odam (here the Odam Poodam), is a cargo characteristic derived from Dhows used in Southern India, and originating in the Laccadives archipelago. She features two leaning mastswith Arab sails (Lateen-Setie), but tops a jib on a short boat-out. As always, the bow is very sharp, though rounded, and the stern sharp and receding.

Coconut wood was used for the curves. Odams had a crew of 4 to 6 men, housed in the rear castle covered with a masted roof, and supplemented by a central hut used for the storage of perishable goods. These vessels generally measured 18 meters for 5.18 meters wide with a draft of 4.30 meters. They load their cargo into a large, one-piece, decked hold. The Odam, which was still in use recently, is beginning to disappear slowly. Their ancient origin remains mysterious.

## Grand Mistress

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/grand_mistress.gif)  
The Great Mistress was a singular ship of Henry VIII’s fleet of England, a contemporary of the Great Harry, halfway between a carrack and a galley.

Modern galleons did not appeared until the middle of the sixteenth century, and the Grand Mistress was unquestionably a precursor. It was classified as a “galleass” on the fleet registers, but an engraving of the time (unless it is an involuntary omission of the engraver, not necessarily a marine engraver), represents it without the least trace of rows, necessary to consider it as such. The term “galleon” was adopted for overseas ships with oars until the seventeenth century.

As a galleon he would have been very well armed, six big bombards and 14 couleuvrines, as well as twenty or so heavy arquebus. Her rigging was that of a galleon, with a low, shallow hull and low castles differentiated her from carracks of the time, making here a steadier and faster ship. We can therefore understand through this precursor how the Galleon quickly established herself and succeeded to the carrack in all Christendom.

## Tchektirme

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tchektirme.jpg)  
The Tchektirme was the typical Turkish workboat, a Mediterranean variant of the flat-bottom coasters rigged with a fore-and-aft rig. This type of ship, linked to the Greek Skapho (a small fishing boat), and the large Sakouleiva, was long-derived from the Byzantine Khelandion (chaland). The French Trecandin was also related to these ships, but with a somewhat different rigging.

## Great Harry

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/greatharry.gif)  
Successively called Imperial Carrack, Henry Imperial, Henry VIII’s Royal Carrack was built in 1514 on orders to replace the Regent, sunk previously after a duel with the French Admiral Ship Mary de la Cordelière (which sank too). Known only from launch as the Great Harry she has been on par with Portuguese Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai, the largest carrack ever built.

Harry Grace a Dieu’s (“By the grace of god”) height was reduced in 1536 to avoid excessive roll, and its rigging lowered. Her artillery was quite impressive for the time, with 184 heavy bombards, up to 251 guns of all calibers. She famously carried the king to Francis I’s Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 for an historical meeting. Afterwards her career was relatively uneventful, until she burn at Woolwhich in 1553.

## VOC Galleon

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/galionhollandaiscieindes.gif)

After their independence the Dutch set up the largest trading empire of their time. Large fleets of versatile ships, carrying large quantities of goods, especially spices and silk, but also well-capable to defen hemselves with powerful defensive artillery.

The lesson of the British corsairs pitted against Spanish trade had been retained. This type of ship specifically used by these large far-east trading companies would later be called “Indiaman”, up the XVIIIth Century.

The VOC galleons, a real multinational with current standards, and at that time a state within the state, with its own army, regulations, police, justice, sent galleon convoys powerfully escorted to these mysterious lands of the “far east”, Indonesia, Malaysia and India.

The enormous price of the commodities transported justified the constitution of this empire. One of these galleons, the Batavia, was reconstituted in the 1990s by the Dutch. She could very well lend itself to an adventure movie so much the history of its mutiny has nothing to envy to that of the Bounty.

## Baqarah

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/baqarah.gif)  
The Baqarah has nothing to do with the gambling table of the casino: This was an old trading ships, close to the Bedan, having a particularly inclined bow, but still roomy and sturdy with high draft.

She is a pure cargo ship that appeared at the end of the Middle Ages, disappearing since the turn of the 20th century. Its antenna was particularly long since it extended well beyond the length of the ship, and came to rest on poles in the back.

## Galleazza Grossa

![Galeazza Grossa](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/galeassevenitienne.gif)  
The “Galeazza Grossa”, a great galley of the fifteenth century, and “secret weapon” that won the battle of Lepanto – the greatest galley battle in history – and turn the tide of history for the Mediterranean world, appeared as a heavier version of the Galea.

The latter was then a small vessel (15 meters), but soon it was enlarged and redesigned to carry artillery like the galleon. 80 meters long, with a complete deck, about 20 guns, the Galeazza was characterized by powerful “castros” like previous Byzantine ships, in place of the gun deck, to fire in all directions. Because of her weight, the Galeazza had a strong draft and required between 4 and 7 rowers per side, manned by a crew, gunners and troops, about 800 to 1000 men in total.

Above all, these heavy galleys were rigged with three Latin sails. But as they were seen like compromises between carracks and galleys, they were also built by the English, the French, and were in use on the coasts of Holland. Rigged like galleons, they could easily be confused with the latter type. Venice unleashed these six Galeazza Grossa in line at the battle of Lepanto on October 7, 1571, which largely contributed to the victory of the Christian coalition against the Turks.

Their height, formidable firepower, well distributed widely contributed to this victory. Galleys disappeared in the middle of the eighteenth century, just like the galley itself, especially because of the incompatibility of combining efficiently strong artillery and too many rowers. Moreover, the defeat of the invincible Armada in 1588 proved the inefficiency of Spanish Galeass outside the Mediterranean.

## Prestige French Carrack: Marie de la Cordelière (1505)

![Marie de la Cordilière](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/marie_de_la_cordeliere.gif)

The Marie de la Cordellière (1505) suspected to be the name of a prominent mistress of Francis the 1st (Henry VII did the same with the “grand mistress”) was the bedrock of the newly-born French National Navy, as a response to a similar move from Henry VIII. This carrack (French “Caraque”) was the first known and admiral ships of the French Navy which later really took shape under Louis X.

There is no known representation of this ship but her history is much better known. This carrack was issued to civilian shipbuilding, borrowing many elements to the Spanish and Portuguese ships, but also Venetian design. They were ancestors of the first galleons, cargo ships with a defensive artillery carried at the last end. Under Louis X, about fifty carracks were specially equipped for war. Traditionally they carried 8 to 20 pieces of heavy caliber, bombards in the lower decks, and a hundred smaller iron pieces more arquebus-size than cannons.

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Combat_de_la_Cordeliere.jpg)

Shots were fired at close range as a prelude to any boarding assault. Marie de la Cordellière was known to be the flagship of the fleet in 1505. She duelled with Henry VIII’s HMS Regent in 1512 in the Bay of Camaret and their fight remains legendary. These two ships rigged each other and were set blazed during the battle, the fire being communicated to the powder reserves. Both ships exploded and sank in a short time. The wreck of La Cordellière was recently found by a team of Breton divers. Henry VII built the formidable Great Harry to replace the Regent, while the French built two other huge war and prestige carracks, the Grande Hermine and Grande Francoise.

## Geobukseon

![Geobukseon](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/geobukseon.gif)  
The Koreans are so proud that they have made at least two reconstructions of these ships relatively unknown to Westerners. Undoubtedly the centerpiece of the marine arsenal of the Chosons, they come from a line of military ships quite surprising originally imagined to contain massive raids of Japanese pirates. The turtle-boat – so called because of its domed roof made of iron scales – was indeed an invention that Leonardo da Vinci would certainly not have denied:

It is simply the first battleship. Its propulsion was assured both by short oars, and thin battened veils, constituted as on the junks of the time, of canvas issued from rice mat, maintained by bamboo yards, pivoting on the axis of the mast And very easy to stir.. from the inside. For in the vast comparative bestiary, the hedgehog would have been equally appropriate to deal with this ship.

The roof was, in fact, devoid of any access (which was made by the back of the gallery), but on the other hand furnished with sharp points, generally hidden by boots of straw, so as to discourage collisions. What’s more, this roof was high enough for the junks of the time. To this passive protection was added a formidable battery of cannon mounted on rolling carriages (6 to 12 per side), and the arms of the men on board.

The dragon’s head, at the beginning lower, was in fact the exit of a barrel pulling from the front. Later, this head served either as a flamethrower in the manner of the Byzantine siphons, or as a thick smoke to conceal the maneuver. The Geobukson (or Kobukson) is large and high, relatively slow but stable, and Eminently formidable. Few of them were produced, but only at the instigation of Yi-Sun-Sin, which took over the “naval base” of the province of Cholla.

Korea was in open war with Japan, whose fleet had heavy and powerful ships. The turtle ship is mentioned from the time of King Taejong (1400-1418), but remained in the prototype stage. It was not until the Ijmin war in 1592 that the Admiral took up the idea of ​​this ship and allowed it to pass to the stage of mass-production.

Three will see the light of day in 1592 and two others in 1595 which will have decisive weight in the battle alongside Panokson, largely the majority. Their action can be compared with that of the handful of Venetian Galleasses at the battle of Lepanto.

## Balam

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/balam.gif)  
The Balam was a kind of Arabian dhow of the Persian Gulf characterized by a curved bow, limited dimensions and a capacity to access rivers. This type of ship began to disappear with the industrialization of the Middle East in the last fifty years. Its origin is unknown, but probably the Renaissance.

## Red seal Fune

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/funeplaisance.gif)  
_Author’s recreation of a “Palace Fune” and Red Seal ship_

The term “Fune” means in general Japanese a ship, whatever its size. Like the Ho Fune previously discussed, the Fune has been declined in many variants resulting from Chinese construction techniques. Even as Japan came into contact with the Portuguese navigators and their Galleons, they continued to build traditional Fune. The one presented here is a large sized ship with three main masts, of the “red seal” type (朱印船 Shuinsen).

She has three decks and superimposed galleries, from a rendition on a wooden print of the Sakoku (Edo) era. The superposed and partially latticed sails as well as the galleries and the parrot at the front with a hierarchy of mast sizes distributed as on the Galleons testified to some Western influence.

![Red Seal Ship](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RedSealShip.jpg)  
_Red Seal Ship_

For the rest, this Fune had a prismatic hull with a flat bottom akin traditional junks. Some could be armed with guns, but the one presented here had a purely civilian vocation. The Japanese will continue to build this type of ship until the mid-17th century. They were extinguished with the Meiji era.  
Red Seal ships were particularly influenced by the Portuguese. From a time of opening to world trade, they were armed merchant vessels bound for Southeast Asian ports. They presented a red-sealed letters patent issued by the early Tokugawa shogunate and made regular trade excursions around 1600-1635.

![Restoration of a red seal ship](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The_restoration_model_red_seal_ships.jpg)  
_Red seal ship model, early Edo period, National Museum of Japanese History in Sakura, Chiba._

In all about 350 of these ships traded as far as Indonesia, Southern Asia, Malaysia, China (Formosa and Macau only), and the Philippines. They were as large as European late carracks and galleons, at 500 and 750 tons for about 250 crewmembers, international (often Dutch and European pilots). They exported silver, diamonds, copper, swords and other artifacts, and carried back home Chinese silk and Southeast Asian products like sugar, rare wood, and deer skin. Small Japanese enclaves appeared at each trading point.

They were fierce warriors and known as such, and became for some master-less Samurais called Ronin, well-paid and praised mercenaries. Some local rulers hired them in their regional fights, like in Siam against Burma. Their only competitor here was the powerful Dutch East India Company (VOC). One of these ships also reached India and Tenjiku “Indie” Tokubei became very famous after relating his adventures, the Marco Polo of Japan.

It is well possible these ships also fired on Spanish Galleons, which were not well seen either by the Shogunate. However in 1636 with the Introduction of the Sakoku policy links with the foreign world were severed and the Japanese trade fleet disappeared completely. From then on, foreign sailors setting foot on Japan for any reasons were put to death. The country would be opened by Force in 1854 by Commodore Perry.

## Ho Fune

![Ho Fune](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/hofune.gif)  
Japan’s shipbuilding industry was largely inspired by the junks that ran aground on its shore, and more rarely those that traded with the archipelago. As colonizers of Korea, the Japanese of the Middle Ages used junks very early. As a result, the Ho Fune, which appeared before the first contacts with the Portuguese in 1636, betrayed a wide Chinese influence but also Malay, or even Arab, as evidenced by its prow with a long inclined bow.

On the other hand, their hull had a section in tears, with the rear much more massive than the front, tapered, a large axial rudder, more typical junks. The rigging corresponded to this declining width of the forward bow, with its main mast at the rear and two others decreasing in size.

The sails are rectangular, in height, and consist of vertical stripes connected to the center (above) or battened in bird feathers. These were merchant vessels, and the smaller ones carried only one sail for fishing. They often had a figurehead at the head of Dragon or Snake…

## Portuguese Nao Flor de la Mar

![Flor de la Mar](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/flordelamar.gif)  
Example of “Nao” at a time when the Portuguese Caraques had nothing to do with the “naves” of the Middle Ages, this ship was with the “Trinidad”, one of the most powerful units of its time. The illustration is an interpretation of the engraving of “Roteiro de Malacca”.

An example among others of the know-how of the Portuguese at the time when they founded their empire. In order to defend their convoys or “Mudes”, they put on line of buildings able to defend it against any intrusion adverse.

The Flor de la Mar was perhaps a “nao”, a nave in Portuguese, because the classic lateral reinforcements or porticos are absent from these flanks, which pleads for a traditional construction of the South, on board. The engraving from which these illustrations are derived comes from the Roteiro de Malacca. It seemed to argue in the direction of a ship with six or seven decks, which was considerable.

The relative dispersal of the artillery typical of this period is also noted. The galleons of the sixteenth century will distribute them more effectively. As a result, the building was to measure 60 meters overall, for a height at the waterline at the handrail of the last bridge of the 20-meter aft deck.

Its width, like any round ship of the time, at the ratio of 3/1, should be 20 meters at the waterline, the tops being much finer according to the “pear shape” of its section. With 36 pieces of main artillery, not counting the mangonels and stones that could be adapted to the windows, it was a unit of first strike, considered as the most powerful of its time.

## Santa Maria

![Santa Maria](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/santa_maria.gif)  
“Nao”, Carrack or Caravel were famous names, and the Santa Maria, in between these types, was the flagship of Christopher Columbus during his expedition to “indies”. This reconstruction here is that of a “Mixed Caravel” with caravel attributes but squared rigging.

At one time Cogs, Hulks, Carracks and Navas/Naos (Distinction was made especially on rigging and tonnage), the Santa Maria proceeded from both the Nao (Latin name Nava, know as the Kogge in the north) and the early carrack. The latter was distinguished by a larger forecastle, and often a topsail sail above their foresail. Tonnage was higher too, and they often sported reinforcing bars, whether they were bordered with clinker (North) or freeboard (Mediterranean).

Their dimensions remained in a classic 3/1 ratio, but they were higher on water, with more bulging shapes, and a square stern. They were also the first to bear guns in ports. The first unit permanently equipped with guns was the Nao Galicia, in 1400. It is precisely in Galicia that the Santa Maria was built, nicknamed “the Galician”.

She belonged to Juan de la Cosa and was anchored in Palos de la Frontera for her first trip. 30 meters long and 10 meters wide, the Santa Maria measured 230 tons and possessed perhaps four small bombards in the main battery deck. Her crew was 40 men. After her sinking in Hispaniola the wreck served as timber for the small fort of the Navidad.

The Santa Maria is inseparable from the Genovese navigator Christoforo Colombo (Christopher Columbus). Classically, he lived in an atmosphere of traveling merchants, spices and evenings tales or adventures in the far East. Naturally himself (helped by his family) became an experienced sailor thanks to many travels. During one of them in 1476, his convoy was attacked by the French and he took refuge in Lagos, Portugal, where a large Genoese community was present.

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Emanuel_Gottlieb_Leutze_Columbus_Before_the_Queen.jpg)

There he met his wife, Filipa Perestrelo e Moniz, who will give him three sons. Columbus will make several trips to the shores of Africa with Portuguese Merchants, learning navigation and cartography. He also becomes aware of the long duration of these coastal voyages along the great continent, and became convinced of the possibility of reaching the Indies by heading directly in high seas to the west. The cornerstone of his belief was Ptolemy’s own circumference of the earth was overestimated, and he himself estimated the distance from Europe to Cypango (Japan) to at most 2414 kilometers.

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Portrait_of_Christopher_Columbus.jpg)He established a strong case in order to prepare any questioning of the inquisitors, pleading in 1485 his project with King Manuel II. The latter, influenced by hostile advisers, categorically refused. Disappointed, Columbus leaved for Castile and he was accepted at the court of King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile.

But a first verdict is unfavorable to him in 1490. He retains his luck in 1491 and this time, his project is in the process of obtaining the approval of the King. But the demands of Columbus for his titles and the power he asked for on the lands to discover provoked a new refusal. It was the Queen’s counselor who finally convinced her to accept the expected benefits of such an expedition.

In August 1492, Columbus was ready to leave with three ships, the Santa Maria, and two small Caravels, the Nina and the Pinta, and 90 men. On October 12, after a difficult and demanding journey for Columbus and especially for his crew accustomed to sailing by coast sight and frightened by stories of monsters and periles in the high seas, threaten the expedition to fail. Columbus, a poor diplomat, narrowly escaped one mutiny, saved by the captain of the Nina, his faithful Martin Pinzon.

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Landing_of_Columbus.jpg)

On the 12th of October, then, Columbus landed on the island of Guanahani (San Salvador), and greedy for gold, was led by the Indians farther north to Cuba. His expedition finally took foot on the island further west, named at the time Hispaniolia (Haiti). But the sea conditions had made the carrack unusable and she had been used to build a permanent establishment.

A handful of men were left behind, and Columbus set out again on the Nina up-river, joining Pinta earlier to search for gold further to the west. The return was also difficult, but triumphal. He bring back various artifacts, natives and animals, that attracted much interest, but no or little gold,. Despite some reulctance he convinced the court to the constitution of a larger fleet, counting 15 ships and 1500 men in order to establish a durable colony.

He left Cadiz in 1493 and arrived at Hispaniola, discovering the Fort Navidad without any living soul, while the fort was badly damaged leaving survivors dying ofhunger and illness and the hostility of the “Indians” . Columbus therefore started a new colony, called Isabella on another site. He stayed for a while to manage it, with his two brothers. His chief idea was always to find gold, and he went to explore southern Cuba with three caravels. He returned without new discoveries in 1496.

For his third voyage, in 1498, he was able to arm only 8 ships, and had to divert 5 on Hispaniolia because of shortages. Turning to Trinidad he thought he had finally found the continent. But the situation remained worrying to isabella, and colomb is soon accused of being the bad manager.

The King sent his adviser Bogadilla to shed light on these denunciations, and the report led to sending both Colomb brothers to be judged in Spain; Columb is effectively condemned, lost his titles and as a governor of Isabella, but receiving the endorsement for a new exploration mission, his fourth and last trip, in 1502.

This time he explored the shores of Honduras, discovered the isthmus of Panama that he mistook for the passage of Malaysia; But his expedition turned to drama, he lost his ships. He was rescued eventually by the grace of the new governor of Isabella, and returned to Seville where he ended his life without much fame or fortune, passing away in 1506.

## São Gabriel

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sao_gabriel.gif)  
_It was the most famous flagship of Vasco da Gama._

**Vasco da Gama** was born in 1468 in Sines. He was the son of a nobleman of the region, Estevão da Gama, but as a younger brother neither inherited the title nor the land, due to his brother. Frustrated, he had to choose between a career of ecclesiastical or military. This was his last choice. Attempted by adventure, he was very early acquainted with the things of the sea.

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vasco-da-gama.jpg)An officer, a fierce warrior eager for a title and recognition, confirmed sailor, he took part in numerous expeditions in Africa and the Mediterranean against the Turks. His youth had been lulled by accounts of the voyages undertaken nearly a century before by the first sailors of the African coasts under the impulse of Henry the Navigator.

Conspiracies were thus opened as far as Guinea. Under John II, the Perfect, the attempt was made to go even further, the ultimate goal being to join the Indies where the trade in spices was most profitable. A first expedition in 1482 enabled Diego Cão to reach the mouth of Zaire. Then in 1486, he explored the coasts of Angola. In 1487 Batholomeu Diaz succeeded in reaching the first Cape of Good Hope, and in 1488 doubled it.

In 1487 the King sent Pero da Covilhã by land to contact Oriental potentates to verify the validity of certain information, but especially the establishment of diplomatic relations and possibly an alliance with the mysterious “Priest john” (a legendary sovereign of an Oriental Christian kingdom, possible allusion to Armenia), which would have made it possible to counterbalance Ottomans. But the emissary of the King, pushing into Abyssinia and India, was able to bring back only information on navigation on the East African coasts.

The King had spoken of the courage of Vasco da Gama and entrusted him with several missions. But the history of the expeditions stopped temporarily. John II had to face a serious internal crisis, in particular financial, and was facing the Spanish ambitions. He had to resolve to sign the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, dividing the world between two spheres of influence. The king perished the following year, perhaps poisoned.

His successor, Manuel I, restored the privileges associated with titles of nobility, and Paulo da Gama, Vasco’s brother, was given the command of a fleet of exploration to India. But Paulo, suffering, “passed his hand” to his younger brother, recommending him to the King. Vasco found himself thus in 1497 appointed by the King at the head of a small flotilla of three naos. (Or caracas):

It was the São Gabriel, its flagship, São Rafael commanded by its brother Paulo, both of 90 tons, Berrio of 50 tons, commanded by Nicaulo Coelho, and finally an old caravel of 110 tons loaded with provisions and water, commanded by Gonçalo Nunes. The flotilla sailed from Belem on July 8, 1497. She first sacked with the old and famous bartholomew Diaz, at the head of her own expedition to the São Jorge da Mina counter on the West African coast.

The flotilla, first rallying the Canaries, set sail for the Cape Verde islands, to refuel and repair the ships before returning to the sea on August 3, and rejoined the Gulf of Guinea. Bartholomeu left his compatriot by saluting him with a volley of white guns, then Da Gama resumed his journey following the wind, which led him to the open sea in the south-west before the latter turned south and brought back to the east.

93 days passed before the land was reported. The temperature had decreased, the wind was more violent. On the 7th of November he set foot on the coast at a point named by Diaz, Santa Helena. Taking again towards the south after having refueled, the expedition was in sight of the cape on the 18th of November.

![Vasco-da-Gama-Zamorin-of-Calicut-Veloso-Salgado-1898](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vasco-da-Gama-Zamorin-of-Calicut-Veloso-Salgado-1898.jpg)  
_Vasco da Gama before Zamorin of Calicut, by painter Veloso Salgado, 1898_

But at that moment, the heavy weather and the threatening sky gave the crew a feeling of fear. Vasco saw for himself that the nickname given by Diza of “Cape of Storms” was not usurped. The frail caraques were swept up by the immense blades, the crests of which crumbled without ceasing their oak frames. The hatches had been closed, but the sailors on deck kept bailing.

Da Gama made a series of round trips between the coast and the south, emerging from the storm to obtain a respite, but facing a contrary wind pushing it towards the west, and returning south to take advantage of the strong winds. A look-out informed him as soon as the land was in sight: The ships resumed to the south. In this way he thought, we were going to be able to cross the cape.

If his crew were exhausted and terrified, his resolve was unwavering. At last, on the 25th, after seven days of sailing, the winds of wind were more clever, and the ground was again signaled. The course was finally crossed. They made a release in the same cove where Diaz had completed his expedition years before, refueling and repairing their ships. The last provisions were taken from the old ship-shop ordered by Nunes and burnt as planned.

[![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vasco-Map-1024x826.gif)](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vasco-Map.gif)

On the 7th of December Vasco da Gama set out again towards the North. In view of a coast on Christmas Day, he baptized Natal. A storm rejected him on January 11 at the coast where he landed on the “land of good people”, baptized as a result of his warm welcome by the natives. On the 23rd he touched land at a place called the land of the “Sinai Bons” in reference to the darker complexion of the inhabitants, a sign of an approaching East.

There they were again warmly welcomed, the inhabitants taking them for Turks; But on the spot Vasco de Gama found neither Christians nor any “priest John” signs. It does not matter: The flotilla remains on the spot 32 days, spent repairing the ships and trying to establish commercial relations.

A good part of the crew is exhausted and sick, and Paulo De Gama, appreciated by men, tries to temper the anger of his brother. On the last day before departure, Vasco de Gama had a stone marker bearing the Royal Portuguese coat of arms, marking his passage. He sailed on the 24th February towards the North.

On 2 March, it is in sight of the island of Mozambique. Again his ploy works. When he disembarked, he and his men disguised themselves as Turks. Everywhere the welcome is warm. Everywhere there are also encouraging signs abounding: They encounter dhows laden with gold, silks, gems and spices.

The local Sultan even agrees to provide them with two pilots to join Calicut. But the Arab merchants present, fearing for their comercial monopoly, denounce the true identity of the Portuguese. The Sultan immediately changed his behavior; Sensing the sulfur, Vasco joins his fleet on two launches when attacked by six armed dhows.

Paulo then intervenes with the Berrio, sending a volley to the address of the ships which fold down on the coast. Vasco da Gama, by retaliation, will bombard the city with his three ships. Then they resumed their journey and on March 7 they stopped at Mombasa. A Portuguese seafarer, who sniffs a trap, prefers to anchor outside the harbor.

That does not prevent his men from disembarking and refueling. warm business relations are even undertaken. Finally the Sultan agrees that the flotilla will be anchored in the harbor. But Vasco da Gama smells a trap and his ships leave, without his two pilots who jumped to the sea and swam to the coast in a moment of inattention.

On 15 April the squadron returned to Malindi, and the local Sultan was friendly. He succeeded in lulling the Portuguese’s vigilance, and the latter freed the Moorish hostages captured in Mozambique, while the Sultan agreed to provide them with a Portuguese-speaking pilot as far as Calicut. The squadron resumed the sea on the 24th, and the captain-major, who thought to impress the pilot, Malemo Canaca, showed him a sextant.

The latter, to the great surprise of Vasco da Gama, revealed what he recognized as a “ladder of Jacob”, an old measuring instrument brought to Arab scientists by Jewish merchants in the past and, above all, a very detailed Arab map of any the East African coast and India.

On the 20th of May, after having rapidly crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese anchored in the port of Calicut. They are impressed by the splendid architecture, the fountains, the brilliant streets and the parks. The welcome, however, is mixed.

Again, Vasco looks for signs of Christendom and finds none. They are granted a hearing by the Zamorin on 28 May. The Captain-Major brings to Manuel I the portrait of a powerful and influential sovereign in Europe, and the Zamorin sketches his desire to negotiate for an alliance. But the next day, the “presents” granted by Vasco Da Gama to the local ruler, which resemble pale merchandise for natives, displeased him. De Gama forbids himself to be a merchant, but only an ambassador. Little diplomat, he leaves the relationship fester.

The suspicions of the Zamorin, maintained by the Arab merchants, reached the point where he forbade the Captain-Major to return to his ships. He is a prisoner in the palace. Vasco succeeded in contacting one of his men outside and charged him with a message for his brother, asking him to anchor and join Portugal, and to return in force.

But, on the contrary, the latter approaches the coast and prepares to bombard the city. The landemain, the Zamorin agreed to relay Gama, but the resentment of the Moors is palpable. The latter supervise him on his return to the quays, and the captain-major, exasperated, is to draw the sword when his brother intervenes and begins a new commercial relationship. Resentment subsides and business resumes.

But soon, the Zamorin will again change his mind and take hostage the sailors of Sao Gabriel. Finally, Vasco Da Gama will leave Calicut and also take hostages. It will remain off, preparing for a possible return, and ultimately the Zamorin will release the Portuguese hostages, demanding that Vasco do the same, and the return journey could begin on August 29, this time with commercial and diplomatic agreements.

The first stop was on the island of Anjediva, where the forests allowed the three vessels to be repaired and dryed for a fairing. Then the Portuguese took the road again towards Malindi. Unfortunately, the Sao Rafael was the victim of a navigation error and came to be dropped on the coast.

Unusable, it was evacuated and burned. Then the squadron reduced to Sao Gabriel Berrio and resumed his journey, rounded the Cape, joined the Gulf of Guinea, and split into two, Nicolau Coelho on Berrio with the task of directly ralier Lisbon, while Gama was transiting his other caraque to the islands of Cape Verde, to remain with his dying brother. His return was no less triumphant, with 55 men out of the 150 parties a year earlier.

Manuel II thanked him princely, granting him titles and the city of Sines, a living allowance for his descendants. Dom Vasco de Gama, Married to an artist, Catarina de Ataíde, took the title of Count of Vidigueira. In 1502 he was made “Admiral Persian sea, Arabs, Indians, and all the Eastern seas”, and invited to take command of a new much more ambitious shipping fleet of 20 carracks and caravels.

This time it is a matter of opening permanent trading posts in India. He sailed from Lisbon on 10 February. On 12 June, he passed through Kilwa, which he bombed on learning of the persecution that had been the victim of Cabral shortly before. The inner demons of Vasco da Gama are then expressed in broad daylight: The admiral sets sail on the red sea that he furrows and ransoms and sinks all the Arab merchant ships he crosses.

But when he crosses paths with a ship from Calicut, he commits the worst: Taking hostage children the edge to make Christians, it sinks the ship with the rest of his crew, not n’pargant women , and then hanged and cut off the hands of his other prisoners, in order to display them in trophies at the Zamorin.

Arriving in Calicut, he demanded that the latter should expel the Arab merchants from the city. In refusing to do so, the latter sees his city bombed two days and two nights by the Portuguese fleet, which nothing stops. Feeling in force, he has signing commercial agreements favorable to Portugal in the Kingdoms of Cochin and Cananor where he establishes counters and then build fortresses on the coast. Then he sets off again to Portugal, the holds full of oriental spices.

On his return to the country, Vasco profited by his titles and position for some twenty years, before the new King John III invited him to attempt a new expedition, with the title of Viceroy of India. In particular, he was to restore the King’s authority to the local governors, who took a little too much liberty.

On the 9th of April, 1524, his squadron left Lisbon. But old Dom Vasco da Gama, who had arrived on the spot, could not exercise his authority as Vice-King for three months. Tired and sick, he died on December 25, 1524 in Cochin. Later on a sculpture was erected of a lying figure, which was placed with its remains in the monastery of Geronimos, next to the poet of the Lusiades, Luis de Camões, who for centuries made it a mythical hero.

## HMS Mary Rose

![HMS Mary Rose](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AnthonyRoll-2_Mary_Rose.jpg)  
On his accession to the Throne in 1509, Henry VIII inherited the nucleus of a navy created by his father in the form of five ships, including Regent caravans and Sovereign. This fleet could be extended by buying or leasing merchant ships, both domestic and foreign, sometimes transformed into lightly armed warships with archers and some firearms. Other ships could be financed by the nobility.

The Mary Rose is undoubtedly one of the most famous Caraques of the English fleet at that time, more famous than the Great Harry who followed.  
Faced with the ever-present threat of the French navy, as well as the potentially hostile Scottish fleet, Henry undertook a shipbuilding program, including the Mary Rose.

According to Nam Rodger (The Salvage of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain Vol. 1) the threat of new Scottish vessels, including Michael and Margaret, was undoubtedly the determining factor in the King’s decision to extend and reinforce Marine. From a technological point of view, these new ships had nothing to do with the elders, they were heavy caravels rather than clinquarts, equipped with heavy weapons mounted near the waterline.

Although the loss of Mary Rose is well documented, the ship’s construction is not. There are, however, some documents that provide important clues as to where and when it was built. A private Venetian letter dated 29/12/1999 referring to an increase in the price of tin because the king manufactures bronze cannons to equip four new ships built in Southampton.

However, neither the names or the tonnage of the vessels are recorded. There is also a mandate given to John Dawtry on 29/1/1510, authorizing a grant of £ 700 for building materials for a 400-ton vessel and a 300-ton vessel. Seven hundred pounds followed by other endowments. The sails, strings, lines, ropes, cables, shrouds, bouyropes, ticks, elevators, top tacks, coils, compasses, racing glasses, bowls, dishes, lanterns, pulleys, provisions and salaries are also noted.

The supposed ships were the Mary Rose and Peter Pomegranate respectively, only two large new ships registered as built in March 1510 in Portsmouth. There was present Robert Brygandine, clerk of the king’s ships in 1495 and generating state documents. Some texts even doubt the existence of the ship, called and often confused with the “great galley” of the Tudors.

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MaryRose-ship_hall.jpg)

After its launch Mary Rose participated in the first war of the young Henry VII, which will last from 1511 to 1514. England threatened to the North by Scotland and to the south by the French was the holy league, Spain, Venice and the Papacy.

His alliance with Ferdinand of Aragon, through his Marriage, obtains that the King of Spain will attack France before the end of April 1512. The fleet begins by making sure of the control of the Channel, capturing 12 Bretons and French ships. In June-July under Lord Howard, the fleet led an expedition to Brittany, the troops burning villages and capturing knights for ransom.

After spending some time in repairs the fleet attacks Brest in August. A great battle ensued, the first with ships having these new heavy batteries in portholes. The Mary Rose attacked the French flagship, forcing her to leave the line with 300 dead and injured, her main mast being cut by a shot on goal.

The high point of the battle arises when a “400-tonne ship”, probably Peter Pomegranate, knocks out the “Carraque de Brest” or “de la Reine” and the great caraque Marie-la-Cordelière 400 to 1500 tons). The Regent caught fire after the entry of the English, and two thousand men were killed. On the English side, the loss of Sir Thomas Knevet (the captain) and Sir John Carew was lost. The English fleet continued its journey by capturing 32 other ships and then retreated to Dartmouth and Southampton.

Before the campaign of 1513, and after the naval review of Greenwich, the fleet, by order of the King, made a regatta to the Strait of Dover, of which Mary Rose emerged victorious, with the greatest admiration of Lord Howard. Subsequently the caraque with the rest the fleet launched a blockade of Brest and disembarks a company of 1500 men who burns and plunder the coast.

However, the French counter-attack with the fleet of galleys of Pregent de Bidoux, sink an English ship and withdraw to Whitsand Bay near Conquer. Lord Howard will attack these galleys by his boats, galleys and Crayers, two of his admirals embarking. One of them will leave his life and the attack will be a failure. It will even give rise to a certain fear of these Breton galleys, and desertions.

Remember Lord Howard will then wage war against the Scots, sinking the Lion and the Jenett of Purwyn. Later the Scots invaded England but were defeated at the Battle of Flodden. Henry VIII will relaunch the war in France, Mary Rose being implicated of operations allowing the recapture of Therouanne and Tournai, then the siege of Calais in October. The caraque was back in Portsmouth for the winter.

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Cowdray_engraving-full-lowres.jpg)  
_Battle of the Solent in Portsmouth_

One hears more about the ship with the Peace signed with France until 1518, its caulking being redone between the 5 of August and 26 of November. When the war was repre- sented in 1522-1525, the **Mary Rose** remained in support on the coast while an English Army reached 80 kilometers from Paris, aided by the Spaniards and the rebellion of the Duke of Bourbons. But Charles’s army is not very reactive and the rebellion fails, while the English army at the bottom runs out and must withdraw, although in Italy at the same time the French army is beaten in Pavia.

The carcass then retreated to Deptford for a complete reconstruction in 1525. The reconstruction is pushed by a complete overhaul at Portsmouth in 1528. Another redesign will take place in 1536. On this date the King of France obtained from the ambassador Prillac the postponement of the three largest units of the fleet, the “Pomegranate”, the Mary Rose and the Great Harry.

The war resumed in 1542, but it is not known whether Mary Rose participated in the operations against Scotland or France. What is known however, is that the caraque was in October 1544 in operations off Boulogne, preventing any exit of the French between Douvre and Calais/Boulogne. A battle ensued on 21 June 1545 in Alderney with French galleys (defeat of the last apparently).

However the French line fleet entered the Solent with the intention of crossing the iron with the English fleet in July. This fleet consisted of 200 vessels, including 23 galleys. The English manage to collect 80 ships and prepare for a defensive battle.

![](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Bronze_Demi_Cannon_Culverins_Pmoth.png)The battle of the Solent will see the unexpected end of Mary Rose. Francis I left the ship-admiral Carraquon (burnt) and Admiral D’Annebault made his mark on La Maistresse, en route to the island of White. The battle began with an engagement of the French galleys, after which the Mary Rose sank, under circumstances that still seem unclear.

It is very unlikely that this is the result of the galleys and their weak artillery, their only role being to attract the English towards the bulk of the French fleet. One of the survivors testified that the ship was flying in the wind to the point where its lowest ports were taken by water (this is also the official report of Sir Walter Raleigh and Burchet.) According to John Hooker, Mary Rose began to roll abnormally as soon as the sails were erected, while another reported the indiscipline of the gabiers???, who would not have folded the sails when asked, and afterwards Venetians tried unsuccessfully to refloat the carrack.

The Mary Rose was spotted again in 1836 when a fisherman saw his nets caught in the sandy structure as later discovered by the diver John Deane. He later removed bronze cannons and some artifacts but the wreck returned into the darkness; In 1965, Alexander McKee continued his international attention.

He launched an attempt with his diving club to find the ships of this famous battle of the Solent. He will be able to set up a sonar research with Professor Harold E. Edgerton (MIT) and John Mills, the site being finally discovered and explored from 1968 to 1971. Extraordinary, the Mary Rose will finally be extracted from the mud in 1985, will be treated and protected, then exhibited in a specially designed museum, now an attraction of Portsmouth. This is the only example of a carrack of that time with this level of preservation. The Swedish Vasa, built much later, was a much more modern vessel, with more than 100 years of gap.
