## **Introduction**

The **Abyssal Overlord** is a powerful and ancient entity, imprisoned in the deepest reaches of the ocean for centuries. Its very existence threatens the balance of the seas, as it seeks to free itself from its imprisonment, reclaim its dominion over the oceans, and plunge the world into chaos. The Overlord's presence is felt through its influence on the **Orca Warlords**, who unknowingly serve its dark purposes.

## **Background and Motivations**

- **Ancient Origins**: The Abyssal Overlord’s origins are steeped in myth. Once a powerful ruler of the seas, the Overlord sought to dominate the world's oceans but was defeated and sealed away by powerful forces, including **Leviathan Lore** and other ancient beings.
    
- **Motivation**: The Abyssal Overlord seeks revenge, freedom, and dominion. Its ultimate goal is to break free from its prison, disrupt the ocean's natural order, and assert control over the seas once again.
    
- **Influence on the World**: Even in imprisonment, the Overlord’s influence spreads. It corrupts marine life, weakens oceanic currents, and spreads its malevolent power through the **Orca Warlords**, who are unaware of their role in its grand plan.
