## **Origins and Goals**

- **Founding**: The **[[Abyssal Cult]]** was founded centuries ago by rogue sea mages who stumbled upon the existence of the **[[Abyssal Overlord]]**. They were lured by promises of immense power, swearing to serve the Overlord in exchange for dominion over the oceans.
    
- **Primary Goal**: The **cult** works to release the **[[Abyssal Overlord]]** by performing ancient rituals and spreading chaos. They believe that once freed, the **Overlord** will destroy the coastal nations and reshape the oceans under their control.
    
- **Infiltration and Subterfuge**: The **cult** operates clandestinely, embedding agents in trading companies, pirate crews, and coastal governments to manipulate events in their favor. Their ultimate goal is to summon a **maelstrom** powerful enough to shatter the barriers keeping the **Overlord** trapped.

## **[[Cult Structure and Leadership]]**

### **[[The Dark Triumvirate]]**

At the head of the **[[Abyssal Cult]]** are three powerful leaders, each responsible for advancing the cult’s agenda through different means.

- **[[High Priestess Mara Vonn]]**: The charismatic and ruthless leader of the cult’s religious and magical activities. Mara Vonn is said to be able to commune directly with the **[[Abyssal Overlord]]**, receiving guidance on how best to serve its will. She performs dark rituals in hidden temples beneath the waves, attempting to weaken the magical wards keeping the **Overlord** imprisoned.
    
- **[[Captain Drakkar Bloodtide]]**: The feared pirate lord who commands the **cult’s** naval forces. **Drakkar** controls a fleet of pirate ships that raid coastal cities and merchant vessels, stealing supplies and spreading terror. His ships are infamous for leaving no survivors, as he believes fear will weaken opposition to the cult's rising power.
    
- **[[Lord Valen Greywaters]]**: A noble of **Waterdeep**, Valen oversees the cult’s infiltration of high society. Using his wealth and political connections, he manipulates trade routes, weakens defenses, and sows discord between the **navies** of **Waterdeep**, **Luskan**, and other coastal cities. He funds the **cult’s** activities and ensures that its agents remain undetected.

### **[[Regional Commanders]]**

Beneath the **[[Dark Triumvirate]]**, regional commanders oversee the **Abyssal Cult’s** activities in key locations, including pirate strongholds, smuggling routes, and major cities. These individuals report directly to the Triumvirate, ensuring that the **cult’s** dark influence spreads unchallenged.

## **[[Infiltration Across Factions]]**

The **[[Abyssal Cult]]** has worked its way into several maritime factions, subtly influencing them toward its goals.

- **[[Whale Campaign/Factions/Trade/Deepwater Trading Company]] (DTC)**: The **cult** has planted spies within the DTC to disrupt trade and siphon resources. They seek to destabilize the company’s shipping routes, causing economic chaos and funding the **cult’s** operations.
    
- **[[Royal Navy of Waterdeep and Luskan]]**: While the **Abyssal Cult’s** infiltration of naval forces is less advanced, there are rumors of strange, cult-like behavior among certain officers. The cult hopes to weaken naval defenses in preparation for the day the **Overlord** is freed.
    
- **[[Intercontinental Orca Clan]]**: The **cult** has converted many members of the **Orca Clan**, promising them a world where the oceans rise, drowning the lands and leaving them in control. The **Orca Warlords** serve as powerful allies, working alongside the **cult** to weaken oceanic defenses.
    
- **[[Oceanic Order of Scholars (OOS)]]**: Though the **OOS** is aware of the **Abyssal Cult’s** existence, they have yet to grasp the full scale of its infiltration. The **cult** works subtly within the **OOS**, corrupting their research and diverting them from uncovering the full truth about **Leviathan’s Lore** and the **Overlord**.

## **[[Rituals and Dark Magic]]**

The **[[Abyssal Cult]]** performs dangerous rituals designed to disrupt the balance of the seas, weakening the magical seals that keep the **[[Abyssal Overlord]]** imprisoned. These rituals are held in secret locations, often underwater temples or remote sea caves, away from prying eyes.

- **The Maelstrom Summoning**: A powerful ritual intended to create a massive maelstrom in the center of the **Trackless Sea**. This maelstrom, once fully formed, will break the magical chains holding the **Overlord** in place.
    
- **Tide of Corruption**: A dark spell cast by **cult** members to taint ocean currents, spreading the **Overlord’s** influence far and wide. The corrupted currents weaken marine life and disrupt trade, making the seas more dangerous.
    
- **Ocean’s Embrace**: A twisted version of the ancient spell that summons great tidal waves to engulf coastal cities, destroying defenses and allowing the **cult** to seize control.
