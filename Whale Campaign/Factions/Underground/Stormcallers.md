# **Stormcallers**

## **Overview**

The **Stormcallers** are a revolutionary group seeking to disrupt maritime power structures and liberate the seas from the dominance of trading companies, naval forces, and pirate factions. Though idealistic in their goals, they are unknowingly manipulated by the [[Abyssal Cult]] to further chaotic agendas.

## **Philosophy and Goals**

### **Philosophy**

- The Stormcallers believe the seas belong to no one and seek to restore a “natural balance,” where neither human, elf, nor company holds dominion over oceanic life.
- They view themselves as defenders of the oppressed, from enslaved coastal communities to overfished waters.

### **Goals**

- **Short-Term**: Sabotage the operations of major factions like the [[Oceanshore Trading Company]], [[Royal Navy]], and certain pirate alliances.
- **Long-Term**: Establish a decentralized maritime society where communities govern themselves, free from the control of powerful organizations.
