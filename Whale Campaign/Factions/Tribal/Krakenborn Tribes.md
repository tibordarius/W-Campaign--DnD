## Overview

The **Krakenborn Tribes** are a collection of undersea cultures that revere [[the Kraken]] as their god, ancestor, or patron. These tribes occupy some of the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean, far from the surface world. Each tribe has its own customs, but they are united in their worship of the great Kraken, which they believe controls the ocean’s fate.

While many surface-dwellers consider the Kraken to be a dangerous monster, to the **[[Krakenborn]]**, it is a deity that grants them power and protection. The Krakenborn live in harmony with the brutal environment of the ocean floor, often engaging in raiding, deep-sea hunting, and magical practices that reflect their bond with the Kraken. They see themselves as the chosen guardians of the ocean’s abyss, with a divine right to rule over lesser creatures of the sea.

## Culture and Society

The Krakenborn are divided into numerous **tribes**, each with its own traditions, but all share a common reverence for the Kraken and the abyssal depths of the ocean. The tribes live in massive underwater caverns, shipwreck cities, and deep-sea trenches, where they build societies based on strength, survival, and reverence for their god.

### 1. Tribal Structure

Each Krakenborn tribe is led by a **Chieftain** or **High Priest**, who claims to have a direct connection with the Kraken. This leader is both a warrior and a spiritual figure, guiding the tribe in matters of warfare, diplomacy, and religious practice. The Krakenborn respect power, and the position of leadership is often won through strength or mystical prowess.

- **Chieftain’s Role**: The Chieftain is responsible for leading raids, organizing the defense of their deep-sea homes, and ensuring the tribe’s survival. In times of great need, the Chieftain may attempt to summon the Kraken itself to aid them in battle or to destroy their enemies.
    
- **High Priest’s Role**: The High Priest (or Priestess) is the spiritual leader of the tribe, overseeing rituals and ceremonies meant to honor the Kraken. The High Priest interprets the Kraken’s will through dreams, visions, and the patterns of ocean currents.

### 2. Krakenborn Rites and Rituals

The **Krakenborn** engage in numerous rituals to strengthen their connection with the Kraken. These rituals are often violent and dangerous, reflecting the brutal power of the deep sea. Many involve sacrifices, bloodletting, or invoking powerful sea creatures to aid the tribe.

- **Rite of the Abyss**: Initiates who wish to join the ranks of the Krakenborn’s warriors must descend into the darkest depths of the ocean, surviving for several days without aid. Those who return are said to be “touched” by the Kraken’s power and are inducted into the tribe’s warriors.
    
- **The Drowning Ceremony**: This sacred ritual is performed when a leader dies or a new High Priest is chosen. The chosen leader must allow themselves to be submerged in the deepest part of the tribe’s territory, allowing the Kraken’s will to determine their fate. If the Kraken deems them worthy, they will survive and emerge empowered by the ocean’s magic.

### 3. Krakenborn Magic

The **Krakenborn** wield powerful magic tied to the ocean and the abyss. Their magic is often dark and destructive, channeling the raw power of the ocean depths. Many Krakenborn are skilled **shamans** or **sea sorcerers**, using their abilities to command sea creatures, control the tides, and summon powerful storms.

- **Summoning Storms**: The Krakenborn’s most feared magical ability is their power to summon storms. By invoking the Kraken’s name, they can create massive whirlpools, tsunamis, or tempests that destroy ships and coastal settlements.
    
- **Control of Sea Creatures**: Krakenborn shamans can communicate with and control sea creatures, particularly those tied to the abyss. Giant squids, sharks, and even smaller krakens can be summoned to fight alongside the tribe.

## Conflict with Surface-Dwellers

The Krakenborn frequently come into conflict with surface-dwellers, particularly those who exploit the ocean’s resources or trespass into the Kraken’s domain. They view most land-dwellers as invaders, and their raids on coastal settlements are both a religious duty and a means of survival. The Krakenborn believe that by destroying human ships and settlements, they are carrying out the Kraken’s will, punishing those who disrespect the ocean.

### 1. Coastal Raids

Krakenborn tribes are notorious for their **coastal raids**, where they emerge from the sea to attack settlements and ships. These raids are often sudden and brutal, with little warning before the Krakenborn warriors strike. Many coastal towns live in constant fear of Krakenborn attacks, and they often hire mercenaries or build defenses to protect against these raids.

### 2. Deep-Sea Skirmishes

The Krakenborn also engage in frequent skirmishes with other underwater factions, such as the **[[Orca Clans]]** or **[[Deepwater Trading Guild]]**. These battles often take place in the deep ocean trenches or around valuable resources like enchanted coral reefs or magical shipwrecks.
