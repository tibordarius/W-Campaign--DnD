## Overview

The **Tortle Tribes** are a collection of island-dwelling societies that thrive in harmony with nature, particularly the oceans that surround them. These peaceful, wise tortle people have an ancient connection to the seas and the natural world, believing in the sanctity of the ocean’s creatures and the balance of life. While they are not inherently aggressive, the **Tortle Tribes** act as vigilant guardians of their island homes, often defending their territories from invaders and exploiters.

Though primarily isolated on their islands, the Tortles are known for their calm demeanor and profound wisdom.

## Culture and Society

The **Tortle Tribes** are spread across various islands in the **Sea of Swords** and **Azure Sea**, with each tribe maintaining its own cultural traditions while sharing a deep reverence for the ocean and its creatures. The Tortles view the world as a series of cycles—of life, death, the tides, and the seasons. They believe their purpose is to help maintain the balance of these cycles, which has led to their strong bond with the sea and its creatures.

### 1. Tribal Structure

Each **Tortle Tribe** is led by an elder or **Shaman**, typically the oldest and wisest member of the tribe. The elder acts as both the spiritual and practical leader, guiding the tribe in matters of defense, diplomacy, and environmental stewardship. Each tribe has its own unique practices, but they all share common elements of **meditation**, **rituals** of renewal, and a deep connection to the **spirits of the ocean**.

- **Elder’s Role**: The elder leads the tribe in spiritual rituals, negotiates with outsiders, and organizes the tribe’s efforts in maintaining the balance of their island environment. They serve as intermediaries between the natural world and the tribe, often performing rituals to appease the sea gods or summon the spirits of the islands for guidance.
    
- **Defenders of the Tribe**: Tortles are slow to anger but formidable when provoked. Each tribe has warriors who train in the **arts of defense**, using **shell armor**, **spears**, and knowledge of their island’s terrain to protect their homes. The **Tidewalkers**, as they are often called, are skilled in underwater combat and known for their resilience.

### 2. Rituals and Beliefs

The **Tortle Tribes** practice a variety of rituals tied to the ocean, life cycles, and the passing of time. These rituals reflect their belief that everything in the world is interconnected and must be respected to maintain balance.

- **Ritual of the Tides**: This annual ceremony is performed to honor the ocean and ask for safe passage and bountiful harvests from the sea. The **Shamans** lead the tribe in a meditative state, communing with the spirits of the deep, ensuring that the cycles of the sea continue unbroken.
    
- **The Shell Ceremony**: When a Tortle dies, their shell is not discarded. Instead, it is carved with sacred runes and placed within a **Shell Garden**, a communal area where the shells of the dead are revered. It is believed that the spirits of the ancestors inhabit these shells, providing wisdom and protection to the tribe.
