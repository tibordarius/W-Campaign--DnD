## Introduction

The **[[Sea Elves of the West]]** are an ancient and elusive race, dwelling in the deep waters off the western coast of Faerûn. Known for their mastery of the ocean’s magic, their connection to the currents, and their fierce independence, these sea elves have forged a unique civilization beneath the waves. Unlike their surface-dwelling kin, the sea elves prioritize the harmony of the ocean and seek to live in balance with the world around them. They are closely tied to the mysterious underwater realms and wield powers unknown to those who live on land.

## Part I: History and Culture

### The Founding of the Western Kingdoms

The **[[Western Sea Elf Kingdoms]]** were established thousands of years ago, long before many of the coastal civilizations of Faerûn rose to prominence. According to their lore, the sea elves were once a nomadic people, migrating through the oceans in search of a homeland. They eventually settled in the waters off the western coast, where they found the deep ocean canyons and coral reefs rich with magic. Here, they founded their great cities, such as **[[Coralspire]]** and **[[Kel’rithal]]**, growing their homes from living coral and ancient magical forces.

### A Life in Harmony with the Ocean

The **[[Sea Elves]]** of the west believe that the ocean is a living entity, filled with powerful spirits and ancient forces. Their magic is centered around manipulating the sea itself, calling upon the tides, currents, and marine life to aid them. Sea elves are known for their ability to swim at incredible speeds, their use of underwater magic, and their telepathic connection with certain sea creatures like dolphins and whales.

**Core Beliefs**:

- **The Sea as a Spirit**: They worship the ocean as a sentient force, believing it to be both a protector and a judge.
- **Balance and Preservation**: Much like their neighbors in the [[Coral Conclave]], the sea elves of the west value balance over domination, using their powers to maintain harmony rather than conquer.

## Part II: Governance and Leadership

### The Coral Throne

The sea elves are ruled by a monarch who sits upon the **[[Coral Throne]]** in **[[Kel’rithal]]**, the largest and most ancient of their underwater cities. The monarch, often referred to as the **[[Tidekeeper]]**, is seen as the voice of the sea itself, chosen by the ocean spirits to maintain balance in the realm. The Tidekeeper is supported by a council of elder sea elves, each representing different aspects of the ocean such as the tides, currents, and marine life.

- **Current Ruler**: Queen **[[Elara of the Depths]]**, a powerful sorceress known for her wisdom and deep connection to the sea.
- **The Council of Currents**: A group of elder sea elves who advise the monarch and represent different regions of the kingdom, including the deep trenches, coral reefs, and kelp forests.

### Notable Leaders and NPCs:

- **General [[Thalorin Reefguard]]**: The leader of the sea elves’ military forces, known for his tactical brilliance and fierce loyalty to the throne.
- **Seeress [[Nymara Watersight]]**: A mystic who communes with the spirits of the ocean and advises the Tidekeeper on matters of prophecy and magic.

## Part III: Society and Daily Life

### Underwater Cities

The sea elves of the west live in massive cities grown from coral and sea plants, shaped by their magic to be both beautiful and functional. These cities are often hidden deep below the surface, making them difficult for outsiders to find. The sea elves have a strong sense of community, with each individual contributing to the survival and well-being of the whole.

**Major Cities**:

- **[[Kel’rithal]]**: The capital of the sea elves, located in a deep underwater trench. The city is surrounded by natural barriers and magical wards, making it impenetrable to outsiders.
- **[[Coralspire]]**: A city known for its tall coral towers and proximity to the western coast, where sea elves often interact with surface-dwellers in times of need.

### Trade and Interaction

While the **[[Sea Elves]]** remain largely isolated, they are not entirely cut off from the surface world. They have been known to trade with coastal cities like Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, offering rare treasures from the deep in exchange for items they cannot produce underwater. They are also wary of surface-dwellers, having seen the damage that land-based empires can inflict on the ocean.

- **Trade Goods**: The sea elves offer valuable items such as **[[enchanted pearls]]**, **[[deep-sea coral]]**, and **[[magical shells]]**. In return, they seek metals and other resources difficult to find in the depths.
- **Relations with Surface-Dwellers**: The sea elves maintain a delicate balance with surface cities, often allying with factions like the [[Oceanshore Trading Company]] when their interests align.

## Part IV: Magic and Warfare

### Oceanic Magic

The **[[Sea Elves]]** possess a unique form of magic, deeply tied to the ocean. Their spells allow them to manipulate water, summon sea creatures, and control the tides. Some of the most powerful sea elf mages can even summon massive water elementals or call upon the spirits of ancient sea gods.

- **Tide Magic**: Allows the caster to manipulate ocean currents, creating whirlpools or guiding ships.
- **Summoning Magic**: Summons sea creatures to aid in battle, such as sharks, dolphins, or giant squids.
- **Water Shaping**: Enables the sea elves to shape water into weapons, barriers, or even vehicles to transport them through the sea at great speed.

### Sea Elf Warriors

The **[[Tideguard]]**, the elite military force of the sea elves, is known for its fierce warriors who ride into battle on the backs of giant seahorses or sharks. They wield weapons made from enchanted coral and bone, capable of cutting through steel with ease.

**Notable Military Units**:

- **[[The Tideguard]]**: The elite warriors of the sea elves, skilled in both melee combat and aquatic magic.
- **[[Seahorse Cavalry]]**: Mounted warriors who ride into battle on massive seahorses, often used for rapid strikes against enemy ships.

## Part V: Faction Relations and Conflicts

### Rivals and Allies
