## Overview

The Nelanther Corsairs are a loosely organized group of pirates and smugglers who dominate the waters around the [[The Nelanther Isles|Nelanther Isles]]. Unlike the more formalized [[Pirate Alliance]], the Nelanther Corsairs are known for their chaotic structure and frequent internal conflicts. They pride themselves on their independence and their ability to evade the [[Royal Navy of the Sword Coast]]. However, this disorganization also makes them vulnerable to larger, more organized factions seeking to control the Nelanther Isles.

**Text to Read Aloud**: 
"The Nelanther Corsairs are a notorious band of pirates and smugglers who sail the turbulent waters of the Nelanther Isles. They have no centralized leadership, thriving instead on chaos and the law of the sea. Their ships, marked by the Jolly Roger, strike fear into merchants and navies alike. However, their lack of unity leaves them vulnerable to more structured enemies. Will you challenge these sea rogues, or perhaps find a way to harness their anarchic might?"
