## Overview

The **Pirate Alliance** is a loose confederation of pirate crews, privateers, and outlaw factions that band together for mutual benefit, protection, and wealth. Operating primarily in the **Sea of Swords**, **Azure Sea**, and surrounding waters, the Pirate Alliance is a scourge to lawful seafarers and a formidable opponent to the [[Royal Navy of the Sword Coast]]. Known for their cunning leaders, brutal tactics, and secretive sea routes, the Pirate Alliance can strike without warning and evade capture easily.
