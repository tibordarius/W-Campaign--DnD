## Overview

The Blue Herrings are a formidable pirate faction operating primarily in the Sea of Swords, known for their cunning tactics, ruthless efficiency, and intense rivalry with the Red Herrings. Unlike the Red Herrings' chaotic and often disorganized approach, the Blue Herrings are characterized by their meticulous planning, disciplined crews, and a strict code of conduct within their ranks.  Their name, a deliberate contrast to their rivals, reflects their focus on precision and calculated risk, rather than reckless abandon.

## History

The Blue Herrings emerged from the ashes of a disbanded privateer fleet, many of whose members felt betrayed by their former patrons.  They initially operated independently, but their shared history and similar strategic philosophies led to a gradual consolidation of power, forming the cohesive faction they are today.  Their rivalry with the Red Herrings began almost immediately, fueled by competition for resources, territory, and prestige.  While both factions engage in piracy, the Blue Herrings often target specific high-value targets, while the Red Herrings are more opportunistic.

## Structure and Organization

The Blue Herrings are structured more hierarchically than the Red Herrings.  A council of experienced captains, known as the "Shoal," makes strategic decisions and oversees operations.  Under the Shoal are various smaller crews, each led by a lieutenant who reports directly to a member of the Shoal.  This structure allows for efficient coordination and minimizes internal conflict.
