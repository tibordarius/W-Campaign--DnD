## Introduction

The **[[Order of Oceanic Scholars]]** (OOS) is a prestigious and secretive organization dedicated to the study, preservation, and exploration of the vast oceans of the world. The scholars of this order are drawn from all walks of life, including wizards, druids, sailors, and marine biologists, united by a common goal: to understand the mysteries of the seas and protect the delicate balance of the oceans’ ecosystems. They are known for their knowledge of ancient oceanic civilizations, powerful relics, and their work in uncovering the magical forces that influence the seas.

The OOS plays a critical role in maintaining harmony between the surface-dwelling nations and the underwater world. They serve as mediators, explorers, and defenders of the deep, often working behind the scenes to prevent disasters that could affect both the oceans and the land.

## Part I: History and Purpose

### Origins of the OOS

The **Order of Oceanic Scholars** was founded centuries ago by **Archmagister Elara Thalorin**, a high elf with a deep passion for marine conservation and magical research. Recognizing the untapped potential and dangers of the ocean’s magical currents, she gathered scholars, wizards, and explorers to form the OOS. Their primary mission was to study and preserve the secrets of the seas, while also preventing powerful forces—both magical and mundane—from disrupting the ocean’s balance.

- **Archmagister Elara Thalorin**: The revered founder of the OOS, Elara Thalorin is still a guiding figure for the order. Though she has long since passed, her teachings and research are the foundation of the order’s mission. Her legacy lives on in the OOS’s commitment to understanding the oceans and preserving their secrets.

### Mission and Values

The OOS is dedicated to the following core principles:

- **Preservation**: Protect the ocean’s ecosystems from harm, including overfishing, pollution, and exploitation by surface-dwellers.
- **Knowledge**: Expand understanding of ancient oceanic civilizations, magical currents, and the creatures that inhabit the deep.
- **Balance**: Maintain the delicate equilibrium between land and sea, ensuring that neither realm dominates the other.

## Part II: Structure and Leadership

### The Aquatic Council

At the heart of the OOS’s decision-making is the **Aquatic Council**, a governing body made up of elder scholars and leaders from various marine species, including merfolk, sea elves, and water genasi. The council meets in secret at the **Aquatic Archives** in Waterdeep to discuss the order’s research, set new missions, and handle delicate political matters involving the seas.

- **Council Leader Elara Thalorin (Deity-like Figure)**: Though Elara has passed, her philosophy guides the council. Her teachings on marine magic and conservation are revered, and scholars often look to her writings for guidance.
- **High Scholar Galen Frostwhisper**: A half-elf researcher and expert in ice magic, Galen oversees the OOS’s expeditions in the **Sea of Moving Ice**. He is dedicated to uncovering the magical secrets of the frozen north.
- **Diplomat Nalora Wavecaller**: An aquatic elf responsible for maintaining relations with surface nations and factions like the **Royal Navy** and the **Oceanshore Trading Company**. Nalora is also known for her neutrality and expertise in oceanic diplomacy.

### Coral Scribes

The **Coral Scribes** are the magical researchers of the OOS, responsible for cataloging and studying magical phenomena in the oceans. They focus on uncovering the mysteries of **Leviathan Lore**, the **Gulf Stream**, and the various relics of underwater civilizations.

- **Chief Scribe Maren Shellsong**: A renowned merfolk scholar, Maren is one of the foremost experts on oceanic magic and ancient relics. She leads the effort to study the ancient temples of the **Coral Archipelago**.

## Part III: Locations and Research Stations

### Aquatic Archives (Waterdeep)

The **Aquatic Archives** are the main headquarters of the OOS, located in the **Sea Ward** of Waterdeep. This grand library contains an unparalleled collection of tomes, maps, and magical artifacts related to the oceans. The archives also house the **Council of Tides**, where decisions regarding the order’s actions are made.

- **Special Feature**: A hidden vault beneath the archives, where powerful oceanic artifacts are stored under strict magical protection.

### Crystal Reef Research Station (Sea of Moving Ice)

A remote outpost dedicated to studying the magical phenomena of the **Sea of Moving Ice**, particularly the effects of the **Gulf Stream** and **Leviathan Lore**. The station is staffed by scholars and elementalists who brave the freezing waters to uncover the secrets of the northern seas.

- **Special Feature**: An observatory that allows scholars to track the alignment of the stars with oceanic currents and predict magical surges.

### Sunken Temple Outpost (Trackless Sea)

The **Sunken Temple Outpost** is built around the ruins of an ancient underwater temple, believed to be a relic of a long-lost civilization. The OOS uses this outpost to study the relics within the temple and to protect them from rival factions such as the **Abyssal Cult** and the **Kraken’s Marauders**.

- **Special Feature**: A magical barrier that allows air-breathing creatures to explore the temple’s ruins safely.

## Part IV: Influence and Faction Relations

The **Order of Oceanic Scholars** plays a critical role in maintaining balance between the various factions that seek to exploit the seas for their own gain. Though they are primarily focused on research and conservation, the OOS is also known for its involvement in political matters and its ability to influence oceanic trade, exploration, and warfare.

### Allies

- **[[Coral Conclave]]**: The OOS works closely with the **Coral Conclave** to preserve magical sites and protect the ocean’s natural order. Though the Conclave prefers neutrality, their goals often align with those of the OOS.
- **[[Royal Navy]]**: The OOS maintains a fragile alliance with the **Royal Navy**, often providing them with information on underwater threats and advising them on naval routes that avoid dangerous waters.
- **[[Whale Campaign/Factions/Trade/Deepwater Trading Company]]**: The OOS shares a mutual interest with the **Deepwater Trading Company** in exploring and mapping the oceans, though they sometimes clash over resource exploitation.

### Rivals

- **[[Abyssal Cult]]**: The OOS opposes the **Abyssal Cult**, which seeks to harness the ocean’s dark magic for destructive purposes. The cult’s growing influence threatens the balance the OOS strives to protect.
- **[[Kraken’s Marauders]]**: As a faction that plunders oceanic relics for profit, the **Kraken’s Marauders** are frequently at odds with the OOS, who view them as a destabilizing force in the oceanic world.
