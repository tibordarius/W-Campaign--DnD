## **Location Overview**

The **[[Order of Oceanic Scholars|Order of Oceanic Scholars (OOS)]] Research Center** is a grand and imposing structure nestled in the heart of the **[[Icewind Dales]]**. Built into the very ice itself, the research center stands as a testament to the scholars' dedication to preserving and understanding the mysteries of the ocean, even in the most inhospitable of environments. The center serves as a hub for marine research, housing scholars, magical artifacts, and ancient texts from across the world.

## **Exterior Description**

- **Approach**: The journey to the research center is perilous, traversing through the unforgiving landscape of the **[[Icewind Dales]]**. As the players crest a final ridge, the research center comes into view—a sprawling complex partially buried in thick ice and snow. The structure appears almost organic, as though it has grown out of the glacier itself, with spires and towers poking through the snow, glistening like frost-covered stalagmites.
    
- **Architecture**: The architecture is a blend of ancient stonework and modern magical enhancements. Massive stone walls reinforced with enchanted ice form the perimeter, barely visible through the perpetual snowstorm that rages around the center. The main entrance is a grand archway carved with intricate runes that glow faintly, providing warmth to those who approach.
    
- **Defenses**: Despite its remote location, the research center is well-defended. The entrance is guarded by a pair of massive animated **[[Ice Golems]]**, their eyes glowing with cold blue light, standing motionless unless someone approaches with ill intent. Additionally, magical wards are placed around the perimeter, designed to repel hostile creatures and intruders.
