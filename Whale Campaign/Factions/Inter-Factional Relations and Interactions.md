### Key Faction Summaries

- **[[Abyssal Cult]]:** A chaotic force infiltrating multiple factions, especially [[OTC]]. They work closely with [[Pirates]] and [[Sahuagin]] to spread discord and undermine the stability of the seas. Enemies of most other factions like [[OOS]], [[Royal Navy]], and [[Whale Societies]].
- **[[OOS]] (Oceanic Order of Scholars):** A scholarly organization focused on oceanic research and conservation. They have a cooperative relationship with factions like [[Whale Societies]] and [[Sea Elves]], but are at odds with the [[Abyssal Cult]] and [[Pirates]].
- **[[Pirates]]:** Opportunists working with factions like [[Abyssal Cult]] and occasionally collaborating with [[Sahuagin]]. They remain enemies of the [[Royal Navy]], [[Coastal Cities]], and [[Trading Companies]].
- **[[Royal Navy]]:** Strong protectors of the seas allied with the [[OOS]] and [[Whale Societies]]. Their primary mission is to combat [[Pirates]] and safeguard trade routes.
- **[[Whale Societies]]:** Natural guardians of the oceans, allied with the [[OOS]] and [[Sea Elves]]. They are enemies of the [[Abyssal Cult]] and [[Sahuagin]].
- **[[Sahuagin]] (Shark People):** Predators of the seas, often allied with the [[Abyssal Cult]]. They are a constant threat to coastal cities and trade, and are enemies of the [[Royal Navy]], [[Whale Societies]], and [[Sea Elves]].
- **[[Krakenborn]]/[[Cephalos]]:** Neutral entities that occasionally ally with factions like [[OOS]] or act independently. They maintain a distant stance, focusing on their own agendas.
