### 1. **Tidal Whisper (Cantrip)**

- **School**: Illusion
- **Description**: Dolphins use this to send soft, watery whispers across the currents. The sound can travel short distances and is perfect for secret communication. The messages sound like gentle waves, blending into the natural ocean sounds, undetectable to those unfamiliar with the magic.

### 2. **Current Bend (1st Level)**

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Description**: With a flick of the scroll, dolphins can subtly redirect small currents in the water. They use this to help guide schools of fish, push objects along the seabed, or give themselves a boost when swimming against the tide.

### 3. **Bioluminescent Glow (1st Level)**

- **School**: Evocation
- **Description**: This spell creates an enchanting glow, mimicking the bioluminescence of deep-sea creatures. Dolphins use this to light dark waters, mark territory, or signal others from a distance. The glow takes the form of swirling lights in the water, mesmerizing those who see it.

### 4. **Kelp Grasp (1st Level)**

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Description**: Dolphins summon thick strands of kelp from the ocean floor to entangle creatures or objects. The kelp moves fluidly, wrapping around enemies or tethering drifting items, making it an essential tool for controlling the environment or escaping predators.

### 5. **Song of the Deep (1st Level)**

- **School**: Enchantment
- **Description**: By reading this scroll, dolphins release an ancient, haunting melody carried by the water. The spell has a calming effect, soothing hostile creatures or lulling them into a gentle, dreamlike state. It’s a last-resort tool used to avoid conflict without violence, harmonizing with the natural rhythms of the ocean.


### 1. **Ripple Veil (Cantrip)**

- **School**: Illusion
- **Description**: Dolphins create subtle ripples in the water, allowing them to blur their forms and those of allies. Creatures attempting to target those affected by the spell have disadvantage on attacks due to the distorted watery reflections. This is a favorite spell used for stealthy escapes or sneaking through coral reefs.

### 2. **Coral Shield (1st Level)**

- **School**: Abjuration
- **Description**: Summoning the hard, vibrant coral of the sea, this spell temporarily surrounds the caster or a target with a protective shell of coral. It grants +2 AC for 1 minute. Dolphins use this to protect themselves from sudden attacks, especially from predators or hostile creatures.

### 3. **Echoing Pulse (1st Level)**

- **School**: Divination
- **Description**: This spell sends out a sonic pulse through the water, similar to a dolphin's echolocation, revealing the positions of creatures or hidden objects within 60 feet. The pulse bounces off invisible or camouflaged creatures, making it ideal for detecting underwater threats or searching for sunken treasures.

### 4. **Tide’s Embrace (1st Level)**

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Description**: A swirling vortex of water forms beneath the feet of a target, gently lifting them. It allows non-swimming creatures to float and move freely underwater, or gently transports allies to safety by carrying them on ocean currents. It can also be used to ferry stranded players from sinking ships or dangerous whirlpools.

### 5. **Undertow (2nd Level)**

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Description**: With a sweep of the scroll, dolphins summon a sudden, powerful undertow that pulls enemies 15 feet toward a chosen point. Any creature caught in the undertow must make a Strength saving throw or be dragged through the water, potentially into hazards or deeper into the ocean. Players can use this to manipulate the battlefield, pulling enemies into dangerous positions or closer for an ambush.

### 6. **Breath of the Abyss (3nd Level)**

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Description**: This spell grants up to three creatures the ability to breathe underwater and withstand extreme oceanic pressure for 8 hours. Dolphins often inscribe this spell for their allies, allowing land-dwellers to explore the depths of the ocean without fear. Players use it for deep-sea expeditions or underwater dungeon delves.

### 7. **Maelstrom Surge (3rd Level)**

- **School**: Evocation
- **Description**: The scroll summons a miniature maelstrom at a point within range (30 feet). The maelstrom pulls creatures within 10 feet toward the center, dealing 3d6 bludgeoning damage and reducing their movement to 0 for one round. Dolphins inscribe this spell to control battlefields, creating chaos among their enemies. For players, it's an excellent tool for both crowd control and damage.

### 8. **Call of the Leviathan (3rd Level)**

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Description**: By invoking the ancient magic of the sea’s giants, this spell summons a spectral leviathan tail to strike a target area within 30 feet. The tail slams down, dealing 4d8 force damage to creatures in a 15-foot radius and knocking them prone. Dolphins use this powerful spell only in times of great need, calling upon the might of oceanic titans. Players can use this in larger, more dangerous encounters to deal heavy damage and disrupt enemy formations.
