> This is a well-organized central hub for your Nautical Campaign Knowledge Vault! It clearly lays out the different areas of information available.
> 
> Here are a few suggestions for improvement, focusing on clarity, usability, and completeness:
> 
> 1.  **Add a brief, evocative opening sentence:** Before the &quot;Welcome&quot; heading, consider adding a very short sentence or phrase that sets the tone or theme of the campaign, making the file immediately immersive.
> 2.  **Refine the &quot;World Overview&quot; section:** The current overview lists major regions and landmarks under the &quot;World Overview&quot; link. While the link itself goes to a [[World Map]], the description under the link here is a bit redundant. You could streamline this section, maybe just listing the major regions with brief evocative descriptions and linking directly to their respective overview files if they exist (like [[Sea of Swords]], [[Trackless Sea]], [[Sea of Moving Ice]]). The [[World Map]] link could then stand on its own as the main geographical reference.
> 3.  **Consolidate or clarify &quot;Quick Navigation&quot;:** The &quot;Quick Navigation&quot; section largely duplicates the main &quot;Table of Contents.&quot; You could consider:
>     *   Removing the &quot;Quick Navigation&quot; section entirely if the Table of Contents is sufficient.
>     *   Keeping it but focusing only on the *most frequently* accessed links (like perhaps the current location, current quests, and recent session notes).
>     *   Renaming it something like &quot;Key Overviews&quot; and just listing the main overview pages ([[Faction Overview]], [[Location Overview]], [[Quests Overview]], [[Encounters Overview]], [[NPC Index]], [[Artifacts &amp; Items]]).
> 4.  **Enhance &quot;Recent Updates&quot;:** The current setup lists the most recent session and current quests, which is helpful. To make it even more useful, you could include a date for the update and a very brief note about the *content* of the update (e.g., &quot;Thu May 08 2025: [[Session 5 Summary]] - Party arrived in Luskan and investigated the Missing Sailor quest.&quot; or &quot;Thu May 08 2025: [[Party’s Current Quests]] updated with new objective in Luskan.&quot;). This gives a quick summary without needing to click through.
> 5.  **Consider adding a &quot;Player Characters&quot; or &quot;Party&quot; section:** Depending on how you structure your vault, having a central place to link to individual player character notes or overall party information might be useful. This could be a new top-level section in the Table of Contents.
> 6.  **Consider adding a &quot;Rules &amp; Mechanics&quot; section:** If you have any house rules, specific campaign mechanics (like ship combat rules, unique crafting systems, etc.), or important rules references, a dedicated section could be beneficial.
> 
> Here&#x27;s a slightly revised structure incorporating some of these ideas:
> 
> &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
> &lt;evocative opening sentence/phrase&gt;
> 
> &lt;pre class&#x3D;&quot;frontmatter language-yaml&quot; tabindex&#x3D;&quot;0&quot; style&#x3D;&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;
