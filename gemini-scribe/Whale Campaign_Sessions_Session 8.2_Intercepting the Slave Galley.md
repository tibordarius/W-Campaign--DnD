> # Session 8.2: Intercepting the Slave Galley - Aftermath
> 
> Following the successful interception and boarding of the slave galley, the party now has several immediate concerns and opportunities.
> 
> ## Immediate Aftermath
> 
> **1. Securing the Galley:**
> 
> *   The party needs to fully secure the galley, ensuring all remaining hostile crew members are incapacitated or captured. The galley was crewed by 6 guards (veteran stats), 12 sailors (commoner stats), and 1 captain (gladiator stats).
> *   Assess the condition of the galley. It is a heavily guarded ship, armed with ballistae. A typical galley has an Armor Class of 15 and 500 Hit Points. Its speed is around 4 mph or 96 miles per day.
> *   Any damage sustained during the ship-to-ship combat needs to be noted. The party&#x27;s ship, for example, had an AC of 15 and 100 HP, with potential speed adjustments from upgrades.
> 
> **2. Assisting the Enslaved Passengers:**
> 
> *   The primary objective was to secure the galley without harming the slaves below deck. The party needs to tend to the needs of the freed individuals. They are likely in poor condition after being held in harsh conditions.
> *   Among the enslaved are gladiators being transported to the [[Arena of Champions]]. This aligns with information gathered during downtime about [[Golgamovs Brother]] being a star gladiator there.
> 
> **3. Interrogating Captured Crew:**
> 
> *   Information needs to be extracted from the surviving guards, sailors, and especially the captain.
> *   Key questions to ask include:
>     *   The exact route the galley was taking and its destination, the [[Arena of Champions]].
>     *   Details about the operations of the slave galley and who is behind it.
>     *   More information about the notable passengers, specifically Golgamov&#x27;s brother and Rosilia&#x27;s crewmate.
>     *   Any knowledge of [[Jammer]], the gnome cook, who was rumored to be enslaved aboard.
>     *   Information about the mage who was on board and used spells like *fog cloud* and *magic missile*.
>     *   Any connections to the [[Abyssal Cult Connections]], especially regarding shipping manifests and coded notes hinting at hidden chambers beneath the arena.
> 
> **4. Examining Documents and Cargo:**
> 
> *   Search the captain&#x27;s quarters and cargo hold for any relevant documents.
> *   Shipping manifests could confirm the galley&#x27;s operations and link them to the [[Abyssal Cult Connections]].
> *   A coded note potentially reveals the existence and location of hidden chambers beneath the [[Arena of Champions]].
> *   Any unusual cargo could provide further clues about the slave trade or the cult&#x27;s activities.
> 
> ## Moving Forward
> 
> Based on the discoveries, the party has several paths they can pursue:
> 
> *   **Proceed to the [[Arena of Champions]]:** The intelligence gathered strongly points towards the arena as the location of Golgamov&#x27;s brother and potentially Rosilia&#x27;s crewmate and [[Jammer]]. The [[Complete Arena Quest Overview]] outlines the full arc related to the arena.
> *   **Investigate [[Abyssal Cult Connections]] Further:** The link between the galley and the cult is significant. The party could delve deeper into the cult&#x27;s activities, perhaps following leads from the shipping manifests or coded notes. The [[Abyssal Cult Connections]] document provides more details on the cult&#x27;s operations and key figures like the Abyssal Cult Patron and the Wizard.
> *   **Follow Up on Rosilia&#x27;s Crewmate:** With a potential sighting of a crewmate on the galley and rumors of another in the arena or held by the Abyssal Cult, Rosilia&#x27;s personal quest can be further pursued. The [[Rosilia&#x27;s Crew]] document details her missing crewmates and potential locations.
> *   **Utilize New Allies:** If rescued, [[Jammer]] can provide valuable knowledge of hidden passages within the arena.
> 
> The successful interception of the slave galley serves as a crucial step, providing the party with vital information and directing them towards the [[Arena of Champions]] and the deeper machinations of the [[Abyssal Cult Connections]].
