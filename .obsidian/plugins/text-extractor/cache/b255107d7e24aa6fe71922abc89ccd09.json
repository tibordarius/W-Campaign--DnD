{"path":"Whale campaign/A Structure/Reference and Rules/392145-ExpandedSailing_v1.1.pdf","text":"EXPANDED SAILING SHIP OPTIONS & UPGRADES A captain bellows orders to his crew as they struggle to control the sails against the storm winds. Tacking slowly through a harbour a brig draws fascinated stares from children playing. Rocking violently a 3rd-rate fully rigged ship fires it’s second broadside and its crew cheers as the first of the enemy’s ships begins to take on water. Many worlds rely on naval transport for everything from trading to warfare. Early in the career of adventurers any interaction with these marvels of engineering is likely to be limited to a few bartered passages aboard merchant vessels. Later in a campaign, players may wish to procure their own ship to stop paying other characters to travel, or even to use as a mobile base of operations. Much like a castle or fiefdom bequeathed to or bought by the players, a ship owned by the players provides ample opportunity to roleplaying and new quests centred around the development or protection of their property. Unlike a more permanent stronghold, a ship allows the players to easily change their focus and accept quests located further afield. A solid investment for any adventuring party, ships are one of the best ways for them to transition from local nobodies to national heroes. EXPANDED WATERBORNE VEHICLES PROCURING A SHIP As stated on page 119 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, the campaign may involve the adventurers gaining custody of a ship. These rules provide further information about specific types of sailing ship, as well as base costs should the players wish to purchase a ship themselves. The cost shown includes materials and labour, which may vary depending on where the party chooses to get their ship built. A second-hand ship will obviously cost less than a custom-built ship in most cases. If a character wishes to participate in the construction of a new ship, the cost reduces by a percentage equal to the character’s ability in a relevant skill, at the DM’s discretion. Crew. The crew value indicated in the Expanded Waterborne Vehicles table takes into account the fact that the majority of large sailing ships are outfitted for combat and includes soldiers and crew required to man cannons. Even the largest ships could feasibly be sailed by a significantly smaller crew, but this would make it difficult if not impossible to adequately man the cannons. As explained in the Dungeon Master’s Guide a ship requires a crew of skilled hirelings. Due to the size of some crews, the numbers involved in paying hirelings can often get unwieldy, so it is recommended that the crew is treated as consisting of identical hirelings, instead of applying different pay or rolling individually for each crew member on the ship. Passengers. Each ship can carry a different number of Small or Medium creatures as indicated in the table. Larger ships can carry more passengers than indicated if the crew is reduced, sacrificing combat ability for more possible income from passengers. Cargo. The table indicates the maximum cargo in tons each kind of ship can carry. Damage Threshold. A ship has immunity to all damage dealt to it unless it takes damage equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage below the threshold does not reduce the ship’s hit points. Ram Damage. When a ship makes a successful ram attack, it deals and takes damage equal to the value shown. TYPES OF SHIP Brig. A brig is a two masted, square-rigged ship. Varying in size between around 75 and 165 ft (23 and 50m), brigs are popular small warships with high maneuverability and the ability to reach fairly high speeds in favourable winds. However, they require large crews, especially if fully armed. Capable of carrying between 10 and 18 guns over 2 decks, a brig can take anywhere between 3 months and a year to construct. Caravel. A popular trade vessel, caravels require fairly small crews to operate. Carrying two masts and between 39 and 59 ft (12 and 18m) long, caravels sacrifice some space for higher maneuverability and speed. These 2 decked ships were the predecessor to the far larger galleon, and could carry between 6 and 10 guns. Depending on its size, a caravel usually takes between 3 and 6 months to construct. Frigate. A double-decked, triple masted ship, frigates are the smallest purpose built warships. Usually around 130ft long, a frigate can have between 20 and 40 guns, mounted entirely on the upper deck. A frigate usually takes around 1 year to construct. Galleon. A particularly large warship but also popular as a merchant vessel, most galleons have 3 masts, though the largest have 4. Galleons can be between 135 and 165 ft (42-50m) long and usually have around 5 decks, of which 2 are dedicated gun- decks. Depending on size, a galleon could have anywhere from 36 to 366 guns. As one of the largest sailing ships, galleons take 2-3 years to construct. Schooner. Most schooners are around 60ft and have two masts, though larger versions will likely have more. Popular cargo vessels, schooners do not require a particularly large crew and are among the fastest sailing ships. If required, they have enough space for 6-12 guns, though this significantly reduces the free space on the single deck. Their relatively small size means that one can be constructed in about 6 months. Sloop. Sloops are single masted sailing boat that excels at sailing close to the wind or ‘upwind’. Usually under 50ft long to make it easier to keep the sails under control, sloops are fairly fast vessels with small crew sizes. Like schooners, sloops have only one deck and have space for up to 12 guns, though realistically it is unlikely a sloop would have many more than 4 due to the amount of space that would have to be sacrificed. Sloops are usually constructed in 3-6 months. Rated Ships. Rated ships are the largest and most powerful warships around. Ranging from the smallest 4th-rate (around 145ft or 45m long, with 3 decks and 2 gun decks) to the colossal 1st-rate (230ft or 70m long, 6 decks, and 3 gun decks). All rated ships have 3 masts and require large crews to operate effectively, and almost always carry soldiers as well as ordinary sailors. Each degree of rated ship has the capacity for a different number of cannons. A 4th-rate can carry 50-60 guns, a 3rd-rate can carry 64-80 guns, a 2nd-rate can carry 90-98, and a 1st-rate can carry 100 guns or more. A 4th-rate will typical take a year or two to construct, while a 1st-rate may well take at least 5 years.

It is also highly likely that if they own the ship, one of the players’ characters will be appointed captain. The following actions are therefore presented to aid the DM in adjudicating events likely to occur while sailing and during combat. It is recommended that until boarding occurs, ship-to-ship combat rounds are considered to last 1 minute. In most cases initiative in combat can be determined easily as one ship is likely to have the upper hand and therefore go first in the initiative order. When this is not the case, have the captain of each ship roll for initiative with no modifier. SHIP MANOEUVERS The following actions require the input of the majority of a ship’s crew and excellent coordination. Individual actions are listed later in this document. BOARDING When two ships are within 30 feet of each other, the crews can attempt to board their enemy’s ship. The two most common methods are given below. Grappling Hooks: The crew of a ship can collectively attempt to pull their ship alongside their opponent by throwing grappling hooks onto the other ship. The crew must make a ranged weapon attack against the ship’s AC, using their strength modifier and proficiency bonus on the attack. Once two ships are connected, the crew must spend 1d4 rounds pulling them together, at which point characters can cross between the vessels without requiring a skill check. Rope Swing: Particularly reckless crew members or player characters may attempt to reach their opponent’s ship by swinging on a rope from the rigging. Characters attempting this must make a DC 16 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or risk falling. At the DM’s discretion, a character that succeeds may also make an attack with a ranged weapon or spell while swinging. DROP ANCHOR In many circumstances it may become necessary for the ship to drop anchor. The most common reason will be because the crew or player characters wish to go ashore. In this case, it can be safely assumed that the anchor is dropped effectively and easily. However, the players may wish to drop anchor while sailing to quickly turn the ship. To do so, the pilot must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence check to time the swing of the ship. In addition, the crew managing the anchors must succeed on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check to drop the anchors at the correct time as dictated by the pilot or captain. Both of these DCs may be modified depending on weather conditions following the recommendations in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. If both rolls are successful, the ship turns in the desired direction, its speed is halved until the beginning of its next turn, and it takes 10 (2d10) points of bludgeoning damage. If one roll is successful, the ship turns in the desired direction one round late, its speed is halved until the end of its next turn, and it takes 20 (4d10) points of bludgeoning damage. If both rollls fail, the ship does not turn, its speed is halved until the end of its next turn, and it takes 30 (6d10) points of bludgeoning damage. All damage dealt in this way ignores the ship’s damage threshold. SHIP SIZES & COMBAT SPEED FIRE BROADSIDE Once two or more ships are close enough for their cannons to be of use, standard procedure is to attempt to be the first to fire a broadside, thereby gaining the upper hand in the conflict. To avoid the complications that arise when dealing with the large number of guns common on bigger ships, this action is suggested to simplify things for both the players and the DM. If the ship being fired upon is in a larger size category than the ship firing the broadside, assume all cannons hit. For each size category that the ship being fired upon is smaller than the ship firing, reduce the amount of cannons that hit by 1/4. For example, if a category 4 ship fires upon a category 2 ship, 1/2 the cannons hit. Roll damage for one cannon, and multiply the outcome by the number of cannons that hit. Multiply the target’s damage threshold by the number of hits and subtract this value from the total damage dealt. Apply this final value in damage to the target’s hit points. If the broadside is fired on the up roll, the majority of the damage will be to the ship’s masts and rigging, while if the broadside is fired on the down roll, the majority of the damage will be to the ship’s hull and crew. For ease, assume the masts and sails to be crippled after taking damage equal to 1/4 the ship’s total hit points. A ship can fire one broadside per round; it is assumed that the majority of the round is taken up loading the cannons, with the actual broadside occuring towards the end of the full minute. FURL/UNFURL SAILS In general, the more wind there is, the less sail a ship should be using. However, the crew may wish to change the amount of sail being used for other reasons, or at greater speed than usual. In any extraordinary circumstance in which the sails are to be furled or unfurled, the crew must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity check to efficiently do so. On a failed roll, the ship’s speed change or other desired effect does not occur for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this check may be modified depending on weather conditions. RAM ATTACK If a ship spends an entire round moving directly towards another ship, it can may attempt to ram the enemy. The pilots of each ship make an opposed Dexterity check, adding Proficiency if applicable. If the ramming ship’s pilot rolls highest, the ship deals bludgeoning damage to the enemy ship as shown in the Expanded Waterborne Vehicles table. The ramming ship takes the same amount of damage as the rammed ship, unless it has a purpose built ram attached, in which case it takes half damage. PLAYER ACTIONS At some point during an encounter with enemy ships, the players will wish to be involved in some way. If the players wish to act independently during the rounds prior to boarding, allow each player 3 actions per round, taken in an order agreed upon by the group. The following actions are provided as examples rather than an exhaustive list. Attack. A character with the ability to attack at range can choose to attack the crew of the opposing ship, provided that the ship is within range. Treat any ordinary crew member as a bandit from the Monster Manual, and any specific crew member with an NPC statblock that makes sense. For every officer killed, the crew has a cumulative 10% chance to surrender. If all officers are killed, the crew will surrender on their next turn, at the DM’s discretion Cast a Spell. A character with spellcasting ability can cast spells to aid their ship and crew, or similarly hinder the opponent. Particularly useful spells and new nautical themed spells are included later in this document. Command Crew. A character filling the role of captain or similar rank can command the crew to take certain actions. When fulfilling a command issued in this way, the crew gain a bonus to their rolls equal to the captain’s charisma modifier. The ship maneuvers listed provide a starting point for the possible commands a character may give the crew. Fire Cannons. If a player wishes to be involved firing cannons, have them roll the damage whenever a broadside is fired. Alternatively, a character may be fire the chasers or swivel guns, if the ship has any, in which case resolve the attack as normal against the opposing ship or crew. Repel Boarders. Once boarding occurs, a character can use their action to remove a grapple from their ship, preventing its future use and possibly causing some of the enemy to fall between the ships. Ship Size Category Combat Speed Brig 2 120 feet Caravel 1 40 feet Frigate 2 160 feet Galleon 4 70 feet Schooner 1 150 feet Sloop 1 140 feet 4th-rate 3 140 feet 3rd-rate 3 120 feet 2nd-rate 4 100 feet 1st-rate 4 100 feet SHIP UPGRADES During the construction of a new ship, or occassionally at any point after construction, the owner may choose to apply upgrades to it. The following lists contain both structural upgrades to alter the effectiveness or of the ship and themed room upgrades to provide bonuses to the characters and crew. As with the base ship, the indicated costs include materials and labour, which may vary depending on where the party chooses to get the upgrades installed. If a character wishes to participate in the construction of an upgrade, the cost reduces by a percentage equal to the character’s ability in a relevant skill, at the DM’s discretion. STRUCTURAL UPGRADES These upgrades alter the physical structure of the ship in some way. Some are purely cosmetic, though most provide some form of mechanic benefit. Due to the complexity of some upgrades, more expereinced shipwrights are required for certain upgrades. ARMOUR PLATING By attaching metal plates to the ship, the hull’s damage threshold is increased by +5. Requirements: Professional shipwright Cost: 30 % of base ship cost   CONCEALED WEAPON PORT The ship’s weapon ports, if it has any, are altered to be hidden from the outside. A concealed weapon port can only be recognised with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Requirements: Professional shipwright Cost: 100gp per port   GLASS BOTTOM Glass windows are placed in the bottom of the hull, allowing those inside to look out into the sea. Requirements: Master shipwright Cost: 5% of base ship cost per 10 square feet of glass   INCREASED CARGO CAPACITY By rearranging partitions and cleverly placing bulkheads, the ship’s cargo capacity is increased by 10%. Requirements: Amateur shipwright Cost: 15% of base ship cost MOON POOL Clever construction within the ship’s hull allows the addition of a moon pool. This open pool at the bottom of the ship allows the characters to fish, swim, or launch submersibles. Requirements: Master shipwright Cost: 25% of base ship cost    RAM A ram, usually sheathed in bronze or iron, is mounted on the ship’s bow. A ship equipped with a ram deals an additional 2d8 points of damage when ramming, and reduces the damage taken to 1/2 the damage inflicted. Requirements: Amateur shipwright Cost: 50 gp (Schooner, Sloop), 100 gp (Brig, Caravel), 300 gp (Frigate, 4th-rate), or 1,000 gp (Galleon; 3rd, 2nd, & 1st-rates)   RAPID-DEPLOY SAILS The ship’s rigging is altered to use the most advanced modern technology to allow the sails to be raised and lowered faster than normal. Any sail adjustments can be made in half the normal time, reducing the DC of all Dexterity or Intelligence checks made to pilot the ship. Requirements: Professional shipwright Cost: 10% of base ship cost   SILK SAILS Silk sails can be designed in whatever colour the players desire, and are often embroidered with insignia or coats of arms. Silk sails give the ship superior rates of movement, as a result the speed of a ship with silk sails increases by 25%. Requirements: Professional shipwright Cost: 5 x the number of masts % of base ship cost   SMUGGLING COMPARTMENTS The ship’s bulkheads are altered to provide hidden cargo storages areas. This does not change a ship’s cargo capacity. A smuggling compartment can hold anything that fits within a 5-foot cubic space. A DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check is required to located smuggling compartments in a search of the ship. Requirements: Professional shipwright Cost: 500 gp per 5-foot-square compartment   A Note on Ship Sizes While wherever possible information has been provided regarding the average sizes of different ship types, it is not possible to be fully comprehensive. Naming conventions changed often, and in many cases a ship would change type throughout its life by being rigged in a different manner. In addition, ships would vary greatly in their size within their classification, as they were always custom built for specific purposes. In addition to the average lengths noted in the information regarding each ship, it may also be useful to the players and the DM to know the following suggested beams (widths) of the various ships. As noted before, these varied from ship to ship: Brigs: 30 ft Caravel: 15 ft Frigate: 30 ft Galleon: 35-50 ft Schooner: 15 ft Sloop: 15 ft 4th-rate: 40 ft 3rd-rate: 45 ft 2nd-rate: 50 ft 1st-rate: 50 ft ROOM UPGRADES These room upgrades provide assorted benefits to those who spend time in them, though the amount of room upgrades a ship can have is limited by its maximum room points. ARMOURY Prerequisite: The ship must be a 4th rate, 3rd rate, 2nd rate, 1st rate, or Galleon in order to install this room Room points: 1 Cost: 2,500 gp Benefit: When under attack, any hireling that is not a spellcaster or soldier may visit the armoury and there-after count as a guard (Monster Manual, page 347). Hirelings equipped in this way may also be used offensively rather than just in defence. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS Room points: 1 Cost: 2,500 gp Benefit: As part of this upgrade, the owners of the ship must choose a member of the ship’s crew to become the captain. This room becomes their quarters. The captain gains a +2 to all ability checks made to command the crew. In addition, any hireling actively attempting to protect the life of the captain adds 1d4 to all of their attack rolls to hit. N.B. This upgrade may only be purchased once ENCHANTMENT ROOM Prerequisite: Mage’s Sanctum Room points: 1 Cost: 2,500 gp Benefit: A spellcaster hireling or a character with the Spellcasting or Pact Magic features may use this room to make any magic item that is not a potion or artefact. A magic item crafted in this room costs 3/4 the price shown in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. FANCY CABIN Room points: 1 per two cabins Cost: 3,000 gp per two cabins Benefit: A character that spends a long rest in this room regains all of its expended Hit Dice, instead of half their total. In addition, these cabins can be rented out to paying passengers to make at least 5 sp per mile traveled. JAIL Prerequisite: The ship must be a Brig, Caravel, Frigate, 4th rate, 3rd rate, 2nd rate, 1st rate, or Galleon in order to install this room Room points: 1 Cost: 2,500 gp Benefit: The ship is outfitted with cells to securely hold a number of humanoids equal to five times the ship’s total room points. The specifics of the cells are up to the DM and the players, though it is recommended that the cells provide an average level of challenge to break out of. These cells are intended to incarcerate non- magical creatures only, and do not contain wards of any kind. LABORATORY Room points: 1 Cost: 2,500 gp Benefit: Alchemist’s supplies, a poisoner’s kit, and a herbalism kit are always considered to be present here, and within this room any checks with these tools are made with advantage by individuals who have proficiency with them. In addition, potions crafted in this room cost half their usual creation cost, as stated in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. LIBRARY Prerequisite: The ship must be a Brig, Frigate, 4th rate, 3rd rate, 2nd rate, 1st rate, or Galleon in order to install this room Room points: 1 Cost: 2,500/5,000 gp Benefit: When taking at least an hour to perform an Intelligence or Wisdom check to find specific knowledge within this room, you gain advantage on the roll. At creation, you may choose one from History, Nature, or Religion. In doing so, the focus of the library’s repository of knowledge is the chosen subject, which allows the owner and their allies to take 10 as their roll for any one Intelligence roll made in this room until they complete a long rest. This room may be built multiple times with a different subject chosen each time. A specialised Library costs twice the amount of a non-specialised one. MAGE’S SANCTUM Room points: 1 Cost: 2,500/5,000 gp Benefit: When taking at least an hour to perform an Intelligence (Arcana) check in this room, you gain advantage on the roll. At creation, you may choose to pick one of the schools of magic. In doing so, the focus of the room’s repository of knowledge is the chosen school, which allows the owner and their allies to take 10 as their roll for any one Intelligence (Arcana) roll made in this room until they complete a long rest. This room may be built multiple times with a different school chosen each time. A specialised Sanctum costs twice the amount of a non-specialised one. It is a prerequisite for the enchantment room, planar expansion, summoning circle, and teleportation circle upgrades. MESS HALL Prerequisite: The ship must be a 4th rate, 3rd rate, 2nd rate, 1st rate, or Galleon in order to install this room Room points: 1 Cost: 2,500 gp Benefit: This room can comfortably accommodate between one quarter and a half of the crew and passengers on the ship for a sit- down meal. If a hireling or player character has at least one meal in this room between long rests, they gain a 1d6 inspiration die (as the bardic inspiration class feature) that can be used at any point until the next long rest on any ability check made that directly affects the vessel in some way. OFFICER’S QUARTERS Room points: 1 Cost: 2,500 gp Benefit: As part of this upgrade, the owners of the ship must choose a member of the ship’s crew to become an officer. This room becomes their quarters. An officer gains a +2 to all ability checks made to command any combat-oriented hirelings on board the ship. In addition, any hireling overseen in combat or commanded by a an officer adds 1d4 to all of their attack rolls to hit. PASSENGER CABIN Room points: 1 per 4 cabins Cost: 2,000 gp per 4 cabins Benefit: These rooms can be rented out to paying passengers to make at least 2 sp per mile travelled. PLANAR EXPANSION Prerequisite: Mage’s Sanctum Room points: 2 Cost: 20,000 gp +5,000 gp per 5 cubes Benefit: As part of this upgrade, the owners of the ship must designate a 5-foot square area to function as a doorway to a demiplane. This permanent demiplane of up to 20 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side, and appears as decided by the owners upon the implementation of this upgrade. At creation, or at any point once this upgrade is implemented, the demiplane can be expanded in 5 cube increments, to a maximum of 50 cubes. If the owners of the ship also own a stronghold or multiple ships and purchase this upgrade for their stronghold or other ships, they may choose to have each individual vessel or stronghold link to the same demiplane. REINFORCED POWDER ROOM Room points: 1 Cost: 2,000 gp Benefit: Fitted with three locks and metal plated walls, this room prevents anyone trying to ignite the ship’s powder supply. Any character attempting to enter this room without the required keys must succeed on three DC 16 Dexterity checks using Thieves’ Tools. In addition, if the powder supply is ignited, the explosion is contained within the room and will not cause a fire throughout the ship. SUMMONING CIRCLE Prerequisite: Mage’s Sanctum Room points: 1 Cost: 2,500 gp Benefit: Conjuration spells cast in this room last for their full duration and do not require concentration. However, it is still possible to lose control of a summoned creature if it is attacked or treated in a manner the DM considers to be antagonistic. In addition, any creature summoned within this room that attempts to leave it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, or be granted permission by the creature that summoned them. The DC for the saving throw can be increased at any point after the implementation of this upgrade, at a cost of 2,000 gp per 1 point increase in DC. TELEPORTATION CIRCLE Prerequisite: Mage’s Sanctum Room points: 2 Cost: 5,000 gp Benefit: This room contains a permanent teleportation circle as stated in the teleportation circle spell. This circle can be used to travel to any other permanent teleportation circle providing the user knows the destination circle’s sigil sequence. Using the teleportation circle in this way does not require the use of material components. TEMPLE Room points: 1 Cost: 2,500 gp +500 gp for every extra shrine Benefit: When implementing this upgrade, choose a deity to dedicate it to. Any character aligned to this deity that spends at least 1 hour praying in this room may choose to be under the effect of the bless spell for 1 minute at any point during the next hour. At any point after the implementation of this upgrade the number of shrines can be increased, at a cost of 500 gp per shrine. Each shrine can be dedicated to a different deity. TRAINING DECK Room points: 1 Cost: 2,500 gp Benefit: Those that spar or train here keep their reflexes and skills sharp. After spending at least 1 hour training in this room, choose one of the following benefits which last until you complete a long rest: • You focus on honing your reflexes against surprise attacks. You have advantage on the first initiative roll you make as a result of someone other than you instigating combat. • You practice scoring hits on your opponent with ease. You have advantage on the first attack roll you make using the weapon you trained with. • You practice finding key weak points in an opponent’s armour. Your first successful attack deals an extra 3 (1d6) damage to the target. This damage is of the same type as that usually dealt by your weapon. WAR ROOM Room points: 1 Cost: 2,500 gp Benefit: Characters friendly to the captain of this ship may have their journeys planned in this room. When going ashore, characters that have spent at least 1 hour preparing in this room have advantage on the first ability check they make. In addition, characters defending a ship with a war room may add 1d4 to all of their attack rolls to hit when engaging in ship-side combat. SHIP WEAPONRY The following section provides stats for possible cannons for players to equip their ships. Some cannons can only be equipped on the largest, most expensive ships, and these cannons are themselves the more expensive options. Alternatively, players may choose to outfit their ship with conventional siege weaponry such as ballistae or catapults, in which case the DM should use the information provided in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. SWIVEL GUNS Armour Class: 19 Hit Points: 60 Damage Immunities: poison, psychic Swivel guns are small cannons that can be relocated wherever they are most needed on deck. Usually mounted atop a wooden pillar, they can be crewed by only one man, and fire almost exclusively small caliber round shot or grapeshot. Round Shot: Ranged Weapon Attack: + dexterity modifier + proficiency bonus to hit, range 250/500 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage Grapeshot: Ranged Weapon Attack: Each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures further than 15-feet away have advantage on the saving throw. A creature takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Cost: 150 gp LONG GUNS Long guns are the most commons guns used to arm sailing ships. They require crews of between 4 and 10 to operate depending on their size, and are much more effective at close range: they deal half damage against targets beyond their first range increment. LONG 9 (BOW OR STERN CHASER) Armour Class: 19 Hit Points: 60 Damage Immunities: poison, psychic Round Shot: Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 2,000/6,000 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage Cost: 400 gp 12-POUNDER LONG GUN Armour Class: 19 Hit Points: 70 Damage Immunities: poison, psychic Round Shot: Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 1,000/6,000 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage Cost: 400 gp 18-POUNDER LONG GUN Prerequisite: The ship must be a Frigate, 4th rate, 3rd rate, 2nd rate, 1st rate or Galleon in order to carry these cannons Armour Class: 19 Hit Points: 70 Damage Immunities: poison, psychic Round Shot: Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 1,000/6,000 ft., one target.

Hit: 66 (12d10) bludgeoning damage Cost: 800 gp SHOT In addition to ordinary round shot, cannons can fire a variety of alternative shot types for different situations. Canister Shot: Canister shot consists of a can filled with musket balls that explodes when fired from a cannon. Unlike grape shot, the balls can not penetrate cover. When used in place of round shot, use the following stats: Ranged Weapon Attack: Each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures further than 15-feet away have advantage on the saving throw. A creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to half that dealt by the equivalent round shot on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Chain Shot: Chain shot is two iron balls linked together with a chain. As the balls would whirl like bolas when fired, chain shot is particularly effective against sails and rigging. When used in place of round shot to attack a ship’s sails or rigging, the attack has a -2 to hit due to the difficult involved in firing accurately at a specific ship part. However, a successful attack deals double damage to the ship’s sails or rigging. Grape Shot: Grape shot functions like canister shot, only it consists of larger balls in canvas sacks. Due to the larger size of the ammunition, it retains some penetrative abilities and ignores half cover. When used in place of round shot, use the following stats: Ranged Weapon Attack: Each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures further than 15-feet away have advantage on the saving throw. A creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to half that dealt by the equivalent round shot on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
