TERROR IN THE DEPTHS 2 Introduction “Perhaps I should not hope to convey in mere words the unutterable hideousness that can dwell in absolute silence and barren immensity.” —H.P. Lovecraft, Dagon The coastal town of Portsmouth bears a terrible secret. A powerful cult to an ancient evil, an aboleth called Vh’ervadhreth, has been thriving here for over a century, corrupting its leadership and holding the populace under its pestilent thumb. When the player characters (PCs) come to Portsmouth, they disrupt the balance of the insular town and are seen as a threat. The cult of Vh’ervadhreth will try to either corrupt the party or do away them. For their part, the PCs will have to defend themselves from the cult and decide whether or not to save Portsmouth from the cult or leave the town to its own devices. The hope is that the PCs will choose to be heroes and save the town—but that is up to the motivations of the party and the guile of the Dungeon Master (DM). This adventure is meant to be able to be placed within any campaign setting. DMs should feel free to change the names and settings as needed. Mapped locations are located in the Appendix- Maps section, while characters/creatures that are bolded appear in the Appendix-Foes & Encounters section. Introducing the Adventure There are several ways that the DM can introduce this adventure to the characters: Portsmouth, Population: You The most straight-forward way to bring them in is to have the PCs wander into town on their way to their next destination. There’s No Place Like Home Maybe one or more of the PCs are from Portsmouth and are returning there. This could add an interesting spin to the adventure. They could have a sense that there was always something “weird” about their town and want to do something about it. Mission: Portsmouth The PCs have been assigned by some entity: the nearby temple of a good deity, a local lord, etc., to look into the strangeness going on in Portsmouth. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. TERROR IN THE DEPTHS 3 Portsmouth The town of Portsmouth was founded some hundred and fifty years ago by fisher folk looking for more fertile waters. It wasn’t long before some found prosperity—but at a terrible price. Those that brought tribute to the aboleth and its minions would find their nets full to overflowing. Others— well, others suffered losses. The Arlanda family became particularly adept at appeasing the Great One and rose to prominence in the town, both in wealth and in political power. The current mayor of Portsmouth, Denya Arlanda, is both feared and admired by the populace; admired for her grace and beauty, feared for her quick temper and swift retribution toward her perceived enemies. Denya is also a powerful devotee to the aboleth Vh’ervadhreth and has made many sacrifices to the Revered One and works with its minions, the Kuo-toa that lurk within the harbor. Other members of the Arlanda family control business throughout the town, as well as other families who are their political and cultish allies. These include the Harkleys and the Duvallis’. There is a map of Portsmouth in the Appendix- Maps portion of this adventure. 1. The Harbor This is the breadbasket for the town. There are anywhere from 15 to 25 fishing boats docked here at any one time. Most are associated with the Arlanda family company in one way or another— either directly owned by or indebted to the Arlanda Fishing Company. Deep below the waves is also a patrol of Kuo-toa warriors in service to the aboleth who observe the comings and goings of the community. These are known to the cult, but only suspected by some of the general populace. 2. The Arlanda Fishing Co. While the Arlanda Fishing Company is owned by the town’s mayor, Denya Arlanda, the AFC’s day- to-day operations are handled by Baern Arlanda, the mayor’s wife. Baern is a stern taskmaster and shrewd dealmaker. She is very to-the-point and no-nonsense. She has also, it is rumored by some, fed some of her more “mouthy” competitors to the Kuo-toa in the harbor. One of the warehouses on the company property also has a secret tunnel to a small cavern in which the cultists gather to worship the aboleth and make sacrifices (see Appendix-Maps). 3. Davran Brothers Netting The twin Davran Brothers, Narl Davran and Parn Davran, are the only true competition that the Arlanda family have as far as fishing operations in the town. The brothers run a clean business and are not part of the cult to Vh’ervadhreth—which makes them dangerous to Denya and the rest of the cult. There have been some assassination attempts on them in recent months—but they’ve proven to be tougher than estimated by the Arlandas. The Davrans suspect that the Arlandas are behind the attempts but are stubborn and have no desire to leave even though they have no recourse here in Portsmouth. 4. Harbormaster The Harbormaster of Portsmouth is Calden Wormwood. He is an elderly man with a thirst for whiskey. He is on the payroll for the Arlandas and usually turns a blind eye to their operations. He is a stickler for collecting taxes on incoming craft and on smaller operators, however. 5. The Arlanda Mansion This is a spacious home built by the Arlandas around the founding of the town. It overlooks the harbor over steep cliffs. It is now the home of Denya and her wife, Baern. The chamberlain, Wilton Maginnis, is loyal to the family but is not a member of the cult. He suspects that the family is involved in some dark deeds, but relies on his sense of loyalty more than his sense of morality. 6. Harkley’s Mercantile This spacious shop is owned by the Harkley family and maintained by its patriarch, Domas Harkley. Domas is a widower and the father of three daughters, Imogen, Flora, and Gilda, who help him run the shop. Domas is a member of the cult of Vh’ervadhreth and a friend of the Arlandas. Most goods worth under 25 gold pieces from the Player’s Handbook can be found at the shop. More expensive items could be shipped in from a nearby larger city for an increased cost and shipping time. Weapons and armor cannot be purchased here. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. TERROR IN THE DEPTHS 4 7. Textiles by Duvallis The Duvallis textile mill holds multiple looms and other accoutrements needed to manufacture textiles on a sizable scale. Majel Duvallis runs the textile mill like her own fiefdom and is a powerful member of the town hierarchy. She is a member of the cult of Vh’ervadhreth and a close ally of Denya Arlanda. Majel lives in a small cottage just off of the mill. 8. The Gilled Lily This dockside tavern can get a bit rowdy, but is just respectable enough to not be called a “dive.” The barkeep, Shyla Dumont, keeps runs a tight common room and usually curtails “nonsense” pretty quickly. The tavern is generally free of cult members, as most of them frequent the more posh Silver Cascade.

The Silver Cascade This posh, exclusive club for Portsmouth’s elite is the meeting place for the primary members of the cult of Vh’ervadhreth. Non-members must pay a 25 gold piece guest fee to even set foot in the door and none are allowed into the private conference rooms save those that Denya Arlanda allows. The club is maintained by its majordomo, a sallow half- elf by the name of Valerys Edgstrom. Silver Cascade Menu Guest Fee 25 gp Membership Fee 100 gp annually Elven White Wine (bottle) 10 gp Elven Red Wine (bottle) 10 gp 25 yr. Whiskey 5 sp Dinner (Chef’s Choice) 1 gp 10. The Kraken’s Lament The Kraken’s Lament is a moderately priced inn. It is a two-story affair with a red tile sloping roof. The inside houses eight guest rooms and an ample common room. The bathhouse is a separate building off of the main inn. The guest rooms are all on the second floor. It generally doesn’t present much cult activity—except for the fact that sometimes its proprietor, a Halfling by the name of Tully Hangtoe, gets paid to provide wayfarers to the cultists for sacrifice. These are usually only those that “no one will miss.” Tully is assisted in this by his “bouncer”, a large, dull human named Banno. (Map in the Appendix-Maps).

Smithy This traditional smithy is run by the blue dragonborn, Tarhun Drachedandion. Tarhun is a gruff individual, but kind. He performs blacksmith duties for the town, but is also versed in weapon- and armor-smithing. There is a 35% chance that he would have a weapon or suit of armor from the PHB that a PC requests on-hand. Otherwise, it will take 1 day per 10 gp cost to make it. 12. Neela’s Stableyard The half-orc Neela runs this livery stable with a gentle hand toward the livestock and sharp tongue toward her two-legged customers. But she’s good at her job, no one can gainsay that. Neela is not a member of the cult—she was never even considered.

Harkley Home This ample, but relatively modest, home is the abode of Domas Harkley and his three daughters. It is an old home, dating almost back to the founding of the town, but well maintained. There is a melancholy air hanging about the place, probably due to the death of the Harkley matriarch, Marta, some five years ago. 14. Constable This is the office of the town Constable, Riswynn, Ungart. Ris is a stalwart defender of justice and the law—but she doesn’t get much support from the “elders” of the town she works for. She is paid by the Mayor to maintain order, which she does and does well. Sometimes she’s called upon to arrest folk that she’s not sure have done anything to call for it—but the mayor is the Mayor and that’s all there is to it. The dutiful dwarf is not a member of the cult of Vh’ervadhreth. The actual building is nothing more than an office attached to three stone cells. Ris sleeps on a cot in the office. Rumors Around Portsmouth As the PCs explore the town, a series of rumors may come to light. • Creatures have been seen coming into and out of the waters of the harbor at night. Not human, but humanoids. • People that get on the wrong side of the three families, or those that won’t be missed, tend to disappear. • Domas Harkley has gotten more and more morose since his wife died. • The nights of new moon are particularly dangerous. Don’t be caught on the streets on those nights. • The reason there are no temples in town is that the Arlandas have always run them off as “con operations”. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. TERROR IN THE DEPTHS 6 Events in Portsmouth When the PCs enter Portsmouth, they will be noticed rather quickly by members of the cult. The town, in general, is not very welcoming to strangers. Members of the cult are either secretly looking for potential sacrifices or outright suspicious of outsiders. Roughly 50% of the populace are members of the cult of Vh’ervadhreth, so for any unnamed townsfolk encounter, roll a d% to determine if the person is secretly a cult member or not. Let the players encounter the town on their own for a bit, it will make for some fun roleplaying. Play up the paranoia of the populace—both cultist and non-cultist. Make sure the PCs know how much control the three families have over life in the town. They control most of the cash that flows throughout the settlement and the goods that ship in and out. There is something rotten at the core here and the PCs should feel it more than know it. However, it won’t take long before the Arlandas know of the arrival of potentially powerful strangers in their midst and the cult will begin to take action. The Arlandas will probably feel threatened by the powerful strangers in their town. They are used to being the big fish in a small pond and the PCs, just by being here are causing waves. They may want to leverage their muscle and force them out of town. Alternately, they could decide to try and figure out a way to sacrifice them all to their aboleth overlord. The actions against the PCs could take form of several possibilities: A Show of Force The Arlandas could simply send some cultist thugs to deal with the new arrivals and show them the door, so to speak. Look for an opportunity to spring an appropriately- sized gang on the PCs as they are making their way from one place to another. The cultists will be wearing masks to protect their identities. A Halfling Without Lament If the PCs take rooms at the Kraken’s Lament, Tully Hangtoe could decide that one of them is a potential victim for his partners in the cult. Alternately, he could receive word from the Arlandas that a party member would make a great hostage. Regardless, he’ll see that it is done. The rooms, located on the second floor, all have secret ceiling access from a crawlspace that only the Halfling knows of. PCs can spot the ceiling panels with a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check. Tully utilizes these panels to quietly descend into the room at night and apply rag covered in soporific oil to the nose and mouth of his victim. This renders them unconscious (pending a DC 18 Constitution saving throw). Then he has his bouncer, Banno, come in and carry the victim to the Arlanda Fishing Company warehouse which contains a secret tunnel to the altar of the aboleth. At this point, Banno will keep watch on the hostage while negotiations take place. Other unnamed cultists could also join Banno in the watch. The Best Defense… The cult could just move overtly against the PCs to try and take them out. This could amount to a “High Noon”-style standoff in the streets. The Arlandas, Harkleys, and Duvallis will not participate personally in the attack, but will be masked and observing the proceedings. They will be sure to have an escape route should things go awry. The Murky Depths If the party spends any time around the harbor at night, they could be assaulted by a patrol of Kuo- toa attempting to pull them into the depths to their master, the aboleth (see Appendix-Maps for a map of the grotto of the Kuo-toa). To The Altar Borne The party could be targeted by the cult as potential sacrifices to the aboleth. If so, they will attempt to take them, by force if necessary, to the sacrificial grotto beneath the warehouse at the Arlanda Fishing Company. There, they will meet the nature of their doom. They may also solicit the aid of the Kuo-toa in the harbor to enact their plans. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. TERROR IN THE DEPTHS 7 Turning the Tide Regardless of what action the cult takes against the PCs, the PCs will now probably want to strike back or at least have a stake in staying to help the town. Vital Information In the course of exploring Portsmouth and learning about the town’s troubles, there is some vital information that has to be disseminated to the PCs at some point: • There is a cult in the town that practices human sacrifice and the Arlandas are at the heart of it. • Kuo-toa are lurking in the harbor of Portsmouth. They may be in the service of something more dangerous. They are based in a grotto along the coast of Portsmouth. • Eventually, the PCs must learn of the true nature of Vh’ervadhreth—or, at the very least that whatever the cultists are worshipping is old and dangerous--and seek out its lair below the harbor of Portsmouth. Worship of Vh’ervadhreth As the PCs make their way through the city and gather information with which to take action against the cult, they may learn more about it. • Sacrifices and services generally take place on the night of the new moon. • The aboleth is only referred to by name in ritual. Otherwise, it is only referred to as the Revered One. • The Mayor of Portsmouth leads the ceremonies, with the head of the Harkley family taking over if needed. • Prayers are made to summon the aboleth for it to witness their supplication. Sacrifices are generally made in the presence of the Revered One. • Burbbellopp, the leader of the Kuo-toa beneath the harbor, can be contacted by Denya Arlanda through a special conch possessed by the Mayor. The Grotto of the Kuo-toa The grotto of the Kuo-toa is located along the coast of the Portsmouth harbor, not too far beneath the waves. The entrance to the grotto lies in the waters beneath the Harbormaster’s hall (area 4 on the map of Portsmouth). Maps of Portsmouth and the grotto itself are available in Appendix-Maps. The grotto is cool and damp throughout, with slick floors—making it difficult for non-Kuo-toa to move quickly through the passageways and chambers. • Running will require a Strength (Athletics) check or a Dexterity (Acrobatics) of DC 10 to keep from slipping and falling prone. The passageways and chambers of the grotto are 8 ft. high, unless otherwise indicated. The grotto is dark. 1. Hub Chamber The chamber has a 12 ft. high ceiling. This is the main entryway into grotto and is guarded at all times. At any one time, there are four (4) Kuo-toa guards stationed here. 2. Guard Barracks The floors and walls of this large chamber are covered in algae. Moisture hangs thick in the air here. Four fish-like humanoids stand watch over the five passageways that branch out from this central hub. This chamber stinks of fish oil, wastes, and damp. The walls are covered in algae and the air is moist. Nest-like pallets litter the floor, numbering eight in total. Four of these appear to be occupied by sleeping Kuo-toa. Four spears and shields lean haphazardly against the wall. If a fight ensues, one of the Kuo-toa will attempt to run to chamber 4 on the map to alert their superiors that something is amiss. There is also a chance that the Kuo-toa in chambers 2, 3, 4, and 5 all hear the ruckus (depending on your judgment of the DC versus the Passive Perceptions of the occupants based on the noise level). Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. TERROR IN THE DEPTHS 8 Here is where the Kuo-toa guards sleep when not on-duty. Four are generally on duty in chamber 1 while the remaining four rest here. The ceiling is 10 ft. high. Searching the pallets will yield the following (DC 12 Wisdom [Perception] check): Treasure: 11 gold pieces, 17 silver pieces, 28 copper pieces, a torn piece of a legionnaire’s uniform from a nearby city, and a pair of knucklebone dice where a skull is etched on the side that would show six pips. 3. Monitor Chamber At any one time, there are five (5) Kuo-toa Monitors in this chamber. The ceiling is 12 ft. high. Searching the pallets will yield the following (DC 12 Wisdom [Perception] check): Treasure: 23 gold pieces, 17 electrum pieces, 31 silver pieces, 42 copper pieces, a glass orb filled with moving smoke (slightly magical), a set of bone pipes, and a silver skull the size of a coin. 4. Chamber of the Archpriest This chamber, which bears a 10 ft. high ceiling, is the home of the leader of these Kuo-toa, Burbbellopp. She is surrounded by five (5) Kuo- toa Monitors as an honor guard. The southern-most alcove of the chamber is Burbbellopp’s living space. There is a large pallet in the floor with expensive (likely stolen) silks and a chest against the back wall. Chest: The chest is locked (DC 15 to open, but Burbbellopp has a key). If unlocked without the proper key, a trap could be triggered. Poison Dart Trap: DC 15 to find and/or disable. +6 to hit; 2 (1d4+1) points of piercing damage plus make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 20 (4d10) poison damage (half damage with successful saving throw). The chest contains the following: 117 gold pieces, 38 electrum pieces, 45 silver pieces, 59 copper pieces, potion of greater healing, silk robe with gold embroidery (250 gp), potion of growth, and a spell scroll (call lightning). The floors and walls of this large chamber are covered in algae. Moisture hangs thick in the air. Ten nest-like pallets line the back of the chamber, while the center bears a table with four chairs and a ramshackle stool. Five, larger, more muscular versions of the fish-like humanoids occupy the room. They appear to be unarmed. If the sleeping Kuo-toa are awakened by a fight in chamber 1, they will have gathered their weapons and come to their cohorts’ aid. Otherwise, these four will be sleeping peacefully in their nests. If a fight occurs in chamber 1, two of the Monitors will leave the chamber to assist in that fight, one will go to chamber 4 to alert their superiors, while the two others will remain in chamber 3 unless there is a compelling reason for them to leave. The walls of this chamber are covered in algae and the floor is slick with moisture. Five muscular, unarmed specimens of the fish-like humanoids encountered before are here, as well as a sixth such creature. She is adorned in shabby robes but wears an impressive golden headdress set with aquamarines. If Burbbellopp is alerted by guardian Kuo-toa of an intrusion, the five Monitors will be arranged in a defensive formation around their leader. They may also be joined by whomever came to warn the Archpriest of the intruders. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. TERROR IN THE DEPTHS 9 Burbbellopp’s headdress is made of gold and is set with four aquamarines. It is worth 2500 gold pieces. 5. Waste Pool It is clear that the Kuo-toa have been using this chamber as a waste facility. The Arlanda Warehouse One of the warehouses at the Arlanda Fishing Company bears a secret entrance to the worship center of the cult of Vh’ervadhreth. It is here that any kidnapped victims of the Arlandas and their allies will end up. A map of the facility and the underground chamber is available in Appendix- Maps. Main Warehouse This warehouse is underutilized by the Arlandas, as they want little to no chance of someone coming across the secret entrance to their worship chamber. Generally, there are no dockworkers or longshoremen here—only a pair of guards who members of the cult (cultists). Searching the area at a DC of 15 will reveal that the crates in this building are long neglected and that there appears to be very little activity that happens work-wise in this warehouse. The secret entrance is found near the center of the main warehouse floor—one of the crates is a false door that can be pivoted to reveal an iron-wrought spiral staircase heading down into a small underground chamber. This entrance can be found with a DC 18 check (either Wisdom [Perception] or Intelligence [Investigation], according to the preference of the DM). Warehouse Office This room looks like exactly what it is—a former office now relegated to break area. The two guards that sometimes frequent the warehouse use the place as a room to play dice, take their meal, and to generally goof-off between patrols. Searching the desk (DC 17) will reveal a small secret panel that, when opened, reveals a small velvet bag that contains a single amethyst (100 gp). The stench in this damp chamber is almost unbearable. The back of the chamber bears an approximately ten-foot diameter round pool of foul water. The water bubbles, as if being sourced from an underground spring, but it does nothing to alleviate the foulness. Potion of Greater Healing After drinking this glimmering red liquid, you regain 4d4+4 hit points Potion of Growth When you drink this potion, you gain the \"enlarge\" effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process. This large wooden building houses a moderate number of crates and barrels, primarily toward the back of the facility. There is a wooden catwalk overlooking the main floor that lines the right and back walls, accessible via a short wooden staircase. A set of double-doors opens into the front of the building and to the left of the building. A smaller door leads into an office area. This room bears the trappings of an office that has obviously seen little use other than as a break room. The bookcases along the back wall are empty. The chairs are worn and the desk is stained. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. TERROR IN THE DEPTHS 10 Worship Chamber Who and what the PCs find at the Worship Chamber vary according to the situation: • If one of the PCs was kidnapped by Tully Hangtoe .and Banno, then Banno and possibly another two cultists are down here with the hostage (see A Halfling Without Lament above). • If the PCs are scouting out the area unbeknownst to the cultists, then it could very well be empty. • If the PCs have come on the night of the new moon, then they will find both of the Arlandas, the Harkleys, Majel Duvallis, and approximately a dozen more cultists crowding the area. They will be adorned in green robes and carry ceremonial daggers. Searching will reveal little of use, save evidence of human sacrifice at the altar (bloodstains, etc.). A DC 15 or better Intelligence (Arcana) check can reveal that the fish creature depicted upon the columns and by the statue is an aboleth. The Lair of the Aboleth A map of the lair can be found in the Appendix- Maps. The great aboleth, Vh’ervadhreth, lies in the ocean approximately a mile off of the coast of Portsmouth. It is essentially a valley on the ocean floor. The main lair (chamber 3) is protected from intruders by a thick canopy of seaweed and coral, forming a cave of sorts. The walls of the valley are approximately 8 ft. high, forming a depression in the floor. The lair is all that remains of a great aboleth settlement that was eradicated in the distant past. Now, only Vh’ervadhreth makes its home here. To access the lair and deal with the aboleth once and for all will require either access to the water breathing spell or a potion of water breathing or even cap of water breathing. Also, DMs may want to review the rules on underwater combat in Chapter 9 of the Player’s Handbook. 1. Entry Chamber The chamber is occupied by five (5) Kuo-toa Whips as well as eight (8) regular Kuo-toa. If alerted to the PCs’ presence, they will be hiding in the kelp and around the columns (Dexterity [Stealth] vs. Wisdom [Perception]). Otherwise, the guards will be out in the open. The iron-wrought spiral staircase leads down about twenty feet to a small underground chamber. The walls are damp and the smell of the harbor is strong in the air. The sound of surf also echoes up the lone passageway leading from the chamber. After about ten feet, the passageway begins to decline naturally and arrives at a wider chamber. This chamber is strong with the smell of the ocean and the sound of breaking waves. At the center of the wide chamber is a small shrine. Four pillars, carved with the images of strange fish-like creatures, creatures with a sinister bent, surround a simple stone altar and a marble statue depicting one of the fish creatures. The waves of the imminent harbor threaten to wash over the shrine, it is so close to the shoreline. The opening of the vast valley along the ocean’s floor is dotted with kelp and the walls have colorful bits of coral and shell embedded within it. Entering the valley, there are two parallel rows of columns rising some ten feet high. The columns are made of granite and are carved to depict fish-like creatures swimming and cavorting about. The rows form a corridor of sorts through the valley. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. TERROR IN THE DEPTHS 11 2. Altar Chamber If alerted to the PCs’ presence, the aboleth Vh’ervadhreth will meet them here. Otherwise, the chamber is virtually empty. Searching the far left-hand area of the chamber will yield some treasure left behind by victims of the aboleth and its followers. Searching the area will take 1d4 hours. A successful check at a DC of 15 will yield the following items nestled on the ocean floor and in among the fronds of kelp: Treasure: 725 copper pieces, 877 silver pieces, 285 gold pieces, 77 platinum pieces, brass mug with jade inlay (250 gp), gold ring set with bloodstones (250 gp), bronze crown (250 gp), carved ivory statuette of a nude man (250 gp), potion of flying, potion of speed, potion of longevity. 3. Vh’ervadhreth’s Lair The canopy is approximately 8 ft. high. If alerted to the PCs’ presence, the aboleth Vh’ervadhreth will have met them in the previous chamber. Otherwise, the great aboleth is floating here, unsuspecting. As described, the floor is littered with treasures that are for the taking, should the aboleth be conquered: Treasure: 611 copper pieces, 6509 silver pieces, 2017 gold pieces, 103 platinum pieces, large gold bracelet (250 gp), silver necklace with aquamarine pendant (250 gp), box of turquoise animal figurines (250 gp), gold birdcage with electrum filigree (250 gp), carved ivory statuette depicting an aboleth (250 gp), spell scroll (comprehend languages), spell scroll (witch bolt), potion of climbing, potion of greater healing. After a slight contraction in the valley walls, it opens up into another “chamber.” At the center of this section stands a series of eight columns surrounding a simple stone altar. The columns reach up nearly ten feet into the waters. The valley expands to the left and right for a fair distance and, up ahead, contracts again at the entrance of another section that is covered in kelp and coral deposits, forming a cave of sorts. The sea floor in this chamber is littered with discarded bones and skulls. Potion of Climbing When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors. Potion of Greater Healing After drinking this glimmering red liquid, you regain 4d4+4 hit points Potion of Flying When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you're in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft. Potion of Speed When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the haste spell for 1 minute (no concentration required). Potion of Longevity When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by 1d6 + 6 years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a potion of longevity, there is a 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead age by 1d6 +6 years. This chamber is covered by a canopy of coral deposits and kelp, forming a cave of sorts. The canopy protects the area from all outside light that might be shining upon the ocean floor. The floor is littered with treasures, tributes given to the aboleth over a hundred and fifty years of sacrifices. Not for resale.

TERROR IN THE DEPTHS 12 Aftermath If the PCs stay in Portsmouth and deal with the cult of Vh’ervadhreth, and even put the final blow to the aboleth itself, there will be repurcussions: • If the Arlandas are dealt with—either through battle, being brought to justice, or what-have-you, the town will need a new Mayor. The townsfolk could do worse than Parn Davran… • The new Mayor of Portsmouth, whomever that may turn out to be, would probably be very grateful to the PCs and be willing to offer them a reward consisting of a deed of land inside the town. • The cult is dealt with, but the aboleth isn’t, the PCs could return to a new cult menace in Portsmouth. Regardless of the circumstances, if the PCs are successful, Portsmouth can become a town that they can come back to and be welcomed with open arms from a grateful townsfolk—or be shunned as outsiders who bucked the status quo. It all depends on them… Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only.
