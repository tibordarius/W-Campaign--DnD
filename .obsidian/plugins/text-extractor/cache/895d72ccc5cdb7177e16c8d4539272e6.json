Fire burn and cauldron bubble. Cool it with a baboon’s blood. Then the charm is firm and good. - Macbeth - William Shakespeare. This encounter and mini-dungeon is designed to fit into an ongoing Storm King’s Thunder campaign but could just as easily be used as a short standalone adventure or encounter for almost any dungeons & dragons campaign that takes place along a treacherous coastline. No Volo’s? This module is written to be used in conjunction with Volo´s guide to monsters. However should you not own Volo´s you can still use this encounter with some modifications. The sea spawn can be replaced by sahaugin. As they have a challenge rating of 1/2 compared to the sea spawns rating of 1 you may want to throw in a few extra sahaugin into each encounter. The hags will not have access to any lair actions, as such they may be a little easier to defeat. Depending on the level of your party, give some extra consideration to beefing up the final fight against the hags (See the hags lair section for some advice on making the fight harder). The Red Rocks A collection of islands of the Sword Coast that are dangerous to sail and with little to offer except fish and shellfish. There would be little reason for any adventurers to visit the islands if it wasn’t for the murder of the storm giant queen Neri on one of the small islands some time ago. During the events of Storm King’s Thunder your players may very well decide to visit the site of her murder in an attempt to learn more about what happened. The adventure book gives a brief description of the Red Rocks themselves but there is very little to do or find at the location itself. This module expands on a visit to the Red Rocks by offering the party a chance to face a coven of hags that make the islands their homes. The Brineheart Sisters Unknown to most, three hag sisters make their home in a cave underneath one of the small islands of the Red Rocks and they have spent the last few decades waylaying sailors, pilfering shipwrecks and plotting against each other. The youngest sister, Inky Ilsa (chaotic evil sea hag), resents her sisters and believes she would be stronger on her own but is afraid of what her sisters would do to her should she decide to break out on her own. She would quickly betray the rest of the coven if she believed she could survive it. Ilsa has a special hate in her heart for symbols of faith and has a vast collection of holy symbols she has stolen from her victims or found while scavenging wrecks. She delights in defacing them and displays her desecrated holy symbols proudly in her part of their home. The middle sisters name is Salty Selma (chaotic evil sea hag). She is a bitter soul and has a wicked sarcastic tongue, constantly spewing insults and taunts at her sisters and victims alike. Selma has a familiar that takes the form of an eel which alone seems safe from her abuse. She can often be seen coddling the creature, Murky Mags (neutral evil sea hag) is the oldest of the sisters. She is conniving and cunning and will try to manipulate any situation into her favor. Mags only cares about herself and only cares about her sisters as a way to increase her own power. If forced she will quickly sacrifice her sisters to save her own life. The Driftwood Shack As the characters investigation of the Red Rocks comes up empty handed and they come to the conclusion that too much time has passed since the murder and there is little to nothing to be found, they notice a small plume of smoke rising from a nearby island. This encounter will work best if it is late in the day, perhaps as the group is thinking about finding a place to camp or are preparing to leave. Ultimately it will be up to the players whether or not to get involved, but the smoke could mean the presence of a witness. As the characters approach the smoke they spot a small shack built out of driftwood sitting on the end of a beach, the smoke wafting lazily from a hole at the back of the shack. A large, rusty cauldron and a stack of dried driftwood sits beside the door and several fish are hanging on rack nearby. Any character that explores the nearby beach will find a shallow pit filled with ash from a recent bonfire and several dead rotting fish that have The Hags of Red Rocks 3 washed up onto the shore. The hags can sense if anyone handles these fish and can speak through them, but choose not to as it would reveal their presence. The hags will only speak to the group through the fish if they are convinced the characters know of their existence and are coming to destroy them. The hags sometimes visit the beach to brew potions or other concoctions and they keep their cauldron at the shack and their watchman makes sure there is always plenty of firewood ready should the sisters need it. The shack belongs to a haggard old man named Pelwen Durr (neutral male commoner). A few decades ago he was a sailor on board a ship called the Golden Basilisk that ran aground on the Red Rocks while returning to Luskan from Calimport. The sisters found him drowning in the wreckage of his ship and offered him a simple deal, his life in return for his loyal service. Pelwen has long since come to regret his decision but is bound in a pact with the hags and cannot leave the Red Rocks while they live. The old man acts as a lookout and bait for the hags, keeping an eye on the surface and luring others to their doom with his kindness. Pelwen will greet any visitors warmly and try invite them in for tea or dinner depending on the hour and if the characters are looking for a place to rest he will happily give them shelter for the night. He comes off as a surprisingly cheerful old man and will try his best to answer any questions they have, although he will admit that his memory isn’t what it used to be and he isn’t sure how helpful he will be. If the characters seem to want to move on he will try almost any lie to convince them into staying the night, he knows that the servants of the sisters will come for the characters and fears what the hags may do to him should he fail to convince them to stay. The interior of the driftwood shack is divided into two small rooms divided by a curtain made from the remains of an old sail. The larger of the two rooms serves as kitchen and living room while the smaller is Pelwen’s bedroom and holds little more than a cot. Rickety shelves line the walls of the main room, overladen with items salvaged by Pelwen after they washed up on the island. Hidden amongst the trinkets and knick-knacks is a small glass jar filled with brine in which a hag eye (See Pg.176 of the Monster Manual) floats. This is how the coven keeps watch over Pelwen and how they are alerted to any guests he may receive. As night falls a group of creatures sent by the sisters will attempt to sneak their way on to land to steal away with the party. The raiding party consists of six sea spawn and four bloated zombies If at all possible the creatures try to take the characters alive so they can be presented to the coven and offered the choice to serve. If the party proves themselves to dangerous, the creatures will switch tactics and try to kill as many as they can to try to weaken the party to a point where they will be unable to pursue the sisters. In either case raiders will fight to the death. Before the battle starts Pelwen will try to hide, he has seen these events play out to often in the past, and is haunted by the screams of the people he has already betrayed.. Should the party be camping outside, he will crawl in under his cot to hide, refusing to leave his shack and if the party are his guests inside the shack he will excuse himself under the pretense of having to answer nature’s call and instead hide around the back of the shack, clutching his hands over his ears. If the PC´s win the battle Pelwen will break down, sobbing and begging for their forgiveness. He will admit to his part in the hags scheme, confessing to the party that he is an old coward. Pelwen fears that his soul is bound for the abyss for the pact he made and his fear of death and what waits beyond has kept him from acting against the hags. At this point it won’t take a lot of effort to convince Pelwen to betray his mistresses, good arguments or a successful Intimidation or Persuasion will convince him to reveal that the hags lair is series of tidal caves that run underneath the small island. Although he can tell them where the entrance is, Pelwen is in no shape at his age to guide the players to the cave. Sea Zombies The zombies created by the hags from the unfortunate sailors who refuse to accept their deals are bloated and wretched creatures. Due to the unique magic employed by the sea hags these zombies can move freely through water and count as having a swim speed equal to their normal movement. 4 The Tidal Caves The lair of the sea hags is a cavern system that run underneath the small island. The opening is surrounded by jagged reefs, giving it the appearance of the yawning maw of some huge sea creature. Except for a few hours every day during low tide, the caves are completely flooded. Unless the party has access to magic that allows them to breath underwater, they will have to move fast or risk drowning as the tide fills the caves. At low tide the water hinders movement. Unless a creature has a swim speed the entire cave system counts as difficult terrain. Any descriptions will assume that the caves are being explored during low tide, so alter any descriptions as necessary. The waters inside of the cave are murky and filled with filth. Sight within any body of water within the cave system is restricted to 10 feet. Flotsam, broken pieces of pottery and other junk is common throughout the caves and half rotten fish and tangles of kelp drift across the surface and the stench is unimaginably foul. The hags use the debris in their home to camouflage their traps, so it is important to occasionally describe the mess of the cave tunnels. Underwater Combat The party may very well find themselves battling underwater in the caves. Rules for underwater combat appears on pg. 198 of chapter nine in the Players Handbook. 1. Waves and strong currents risk throwing any creature attempting to swim into the cave up against the jagged rocks that line the cave mouth. A creature needs to succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check or they strike the rocks on their way in, taking 1D6 bludgeoning damage. 2. 25 feet into the passage a glyph of warding charged with a dispel magic spell is hidden just below the water’s surface, behind some debris. The first creature to approach within 15 feet triggers the glyph and will be the target of the dispel magic. The glyph has been set not to react to the Brineheart sisters or their minions. 3. A group of the sisters minions wait under the surface of the murky water at the intersection to ambush any intruders. In total four zombies and three sea spawn hide within the tunnels. As soon as a creature enters the intersection they will burst out from beneath the surface to attack. 4. This small cave is the home of one of the merrows that serve the Brinesisters. The chamber is deeper than the rest of the complex and a character wishing to reach the bottom will need to dive down 40 feet. Thick strands of seaweed grown from the bottom of the chamber, some of which are long enough to reach the top of the cave during high tide. Tied here and there into the seaweed are humanoid bones and rusted weapons, trophies of the merrow who makes its lair here. The merrow hides at the bottom of the chamber, along with a sea spawn and two zombies. If it senses intruders it prefers to wait for them to approach, using the environment to its advantage. Treasure Loose coins lie scattered across the bottom of the cave, if collected they are worth a total of 100 gp. A pearl worth 100 gp lies at the centre of the treasure field. 5. The second merrow that serves the hags makes its lair within this small cave. The cave leans upward so during high tide most of it is above water. There are several niches in the sides of the cave walls that have been filled with humanoid skulls. Weapons taken from the merrows defeated foes lean against the walls, but most of them are to old or worn to be in useful condition. The merrow that makes it home here lingers at the back of the cave and is being attended by a sea spawn servant. The entrance to the chamber is guarded by two zombies. Treasure A small pile of 100 gp is heaped up against the western wall of the cave. Amongst the weapons lining the walls a prosthetic silver hook hand (worth 35 gp) can be found and inside of the eye socket of one of the skulls is a small golden sphere (worth 50 gp), roughly the size of a human eyeball. 6. A magical trap is hidden amongst the debris of this tunnel. The trap is two-fold. On one side of the passageway several jars filled with blood are embedded into the wall, a ten feet further into the tunnel on the other side of the passage lies a barrel filled with the skeletons of several dozen quippers. Anyone who casts detect magic on the corridor will feel a faint magical effect from both the jars and the barrel, dispel magic cast on either source will disable the trap for 10 minutes. If a creature other than the Brineheart sisters or their minions pass within 10 feet of the barrel, the jars will suddenly burst open, drenching anyone within 10 feet in sticky blood. At the same time the barrel will start to violently rot, being completely destroyed within one round. The quippers trapped inside will reanimate and become a swarm of quippers, their flesh seemingly regenerating out of nowhere. The quippers will have advantage on all attacks against any creature covered in the blood. 7. The Brineheart sisters cultivate a patch of blisterweed in this passageway. The plant appears to be a orange seaweed with bright red nodules growing across it. The plant is covered with an acidic film and anyone who comes into contact with the plant is stung and burned by it. A creature that moves into or starts its turn in a patch of blisterweed must make a DC15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 acid damage. A character who examines the plant can determine its nature by succeding with a DC 15 Nature check. 5 8. This large caves serves as the Brineheart sisters inner sanctum. In the middle of the room there is a large slab of polished black obsidian that the sisters use for scrying. In the north east corner of the room a large piece of a mast from a shipwreck has been lodged in between the wall and cealing. Carved into the pillar are the names of two dozen sailors, these sailors found themselves shipwrecked or thrown overboard and were “rescued” by the sea hags or their minions and taken into the caves. Many of these accidents were orchestrated by the sisters who love to lure ships in amongst the reefs or to send their merrow to pull fishermen of the decks of their boats. The sisters offer a simple pact, swear to serve them and live, or die and be turned into their unwilling servants. Those who choose rescue by the sea hags and accepted their bargain were transformed into sea spawn after adding their names to the mast, bound to serve the hags for the rest of their lives. Those who refused were drowned and then turned into zombies. In the south east corner of the room a small shrine carved out of driftwood depicts some sort of tentacled creature. The carving depicts Slarkethel. The hags have no connection to the kraken society but revere the kraken as the ruler of the sea. Scattered along the walls of the room are shelves, either made out of driftwood or carved out of the cave walls. Wooden bars or netting prevent items from being pulled off the shelves by the rise and fall of the tide. All kinds of strange knick-knacks and trinkets are kept on these shelves, nearly all of it looted from shipwrecks or taken from victims captured by the hags. Amongst these are a large collection of scrimshaw carved out of human bones belonging to Murky Mags. The western wall is covered with dozens of holy symbols, all of them defiled and scratched almost beyond recognition. The pride and joy of Inky Elsa, who spends a great deal of time admiring her collection and searching for new symbols to add to it. The three sea hag sisters and Salty Selma´s familiar usually try to spread out in the room if under attack, so they are less vulnerable to any area attacks. The sisters will try every trick and edge they can muster to try to survive an attack, including betraying each other if defeat seems inevitable. Whenever possible the sisters prefer to hang back, using their coven spells to try to overwhelm any attackers. Salty Selma will use her familiar to deliver touch spells or to give herself advantage by having her pet perform the help action should she find herself in melee range of an enemy. Both Mags and Ilsa are fully prepared to use magic to escape and leave their sisters to die if need be (See their weird magic in the sidebar). Treasure The sisters have brewed several potions on the beach outside of Pelwen Durrs cottage. They possess a Potion of Healing, a Potion of Animal Friendship, a Potion of Poison and a Oil of Slipperiness. These are scattered around their sanctum, hidden amongst the rest of the clutter on their shelves along with 300 gp in various denominations hidden inside of jars and pots. The Brineheart Sisters The sisters are a coven of sea hags and have access to coven spells (see page 176 of the Monster Manual for more on covens and their spells). Alternatively the Death coven spells from Volos´s Guide to Monsters (page 58) can be used if you have access to that book, The sisters also have access to the generic hag and sea hag lair actions and have weird magic objects in their collection that they will not hesitate to use if their lives are at risk. The first is the petrified husk of a squid that when crushed allows a hag to cast darkness. The second is a small live fish inside of a jar that when swallowed whole allows a hag to teleport as if using the spell misty step and the third is a conch shell that when blown emits maddening whispers before shattering into pieces, allowing a hag using it to cast dissonant whispers. See Volo´s Guide to Monsters for more information on weird magic and hag lair actions (Pages 56 and 59 respectively). Making the fight tougher A coven of sea hags won’t be much of a challenge for most groups by the time they have left the Maelstrom. However there are a few things that can be done to make the fight just a little bit tougher. First of increase each hags Hp to their maximum of 77. Secondly, the sisters need not be alone in their sanctum. I recommend adding one or two water elementals that are bound by the hags. These changes can hopefully allow the sisters to unleash a few of their coven spells before they are overwhelmed. 6","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
