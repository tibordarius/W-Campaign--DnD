The Port Regan Lighthouse 1 Adventure Overview The city of Port Regan maintains a lighthouse on a small island in the Picaroon Sea, approximately twelve miles south of Port Regan. The lighthouse is essential to preventing trading ships from running aground on treacherous shoals in the bay, but two nights ago, the lighthouse’s light went unexpectly dark. In two weeks, the prominent merchant Yvonne Voclain will be coming into port with her ﬂeet and the council needs to be sure that her ships will be safe in arriving on the docks. To expedite matters, Captain Joan Davies, head of the city watch, asks the party whether they are willing to investigate and restore the lighthouse. In exchange, she will pay them 275 gold pieces each, provided the mission is completed in the next week. Unbeknownst to the town guard, The lighthouse has been attacked by a pair of sahuagin priestesses, Hexanqi and Heptranqi, and their sahuagin followers. They have recently arrived in the region and they have killed the lighthouse keepers and are currently working to destroy the lighthouse beyond repair so that they can then prey on shipping that runs afoul of the shoals. Hexanqi is also looking for secrets from a lost triton civilization, which she hopes to plunder for her foul purposes. The Port Regan Lighthouse 2 Travel The trip to the lighthouse requires a small cog (use the statistics for a keelboat). If the party doesn’t want to buy one of their own or secure one through the use of the Sailor Background, there are three sailors who can take them out in their own boats. Jonas and Meena both charge three gold pieces for the journey, which takes them one and a half days in either direction. Dworic, on account of his greater skills, charges four gold pieces to make the trip, which he can manage in one day. Jonas Crewe Jonas (CG male human acolyte) is a devotee of Deep Sashelas (or some other local sea deity). He is stocky and muscular and has an octopus tattooed on his back with its tentacles extending down both his arms. Jonas has a Strength score of 14 and proﬁciency with water vehicles. Meena Pilwicken Meena (N female gnome bandit) is quite tall for a gnome and wears an eyepatch over her left eye. She carries a special mechanized crossbow that allows her to make two crossbow attacks each round. Meena has a Dexterity score of 14 and has proﬁciency with water vehicles and tinker’s tools. As a gnome, she is Small in size, has darkvision out to 60 feet, and has advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic. Dworic Rumnaheim Dworic (NG male dwarf bandit) is a gruff dwarf with a receding hairline and an impressive mane of grey-white hair, which he wears in a long, tarry queue. He has a long beard but does not have a mustache. He is the best sailor of the three: if he is aboard his ship, it has an hourly speed of 1.5 miles rather than 1. Dworic has a Wisdom and Dexterity score of 14, proﬁciency with water vehicles, and makes checks related to operating his boat with advantage. As a dwarf, he has advantage on saving throws vs. poison, resistance to poison damage, darkvision out to 60 feet, and can roll +4 on Intelligence (History) checks to identify the age of stonework. The Port Regan Lighthouse 3 Area 1: The Bay The salty spray from the ship’s bow settles in your hair and on your face as you put the city to your stern and set sail. Some of the sailors and ﬁshers lounging on the piers pause in their morning work to wave at you as you pass by. Depending on which sailor the party chartered their trip with, they do different things: • Jonas Crewe sings a quiet hymn to Deep Sashelas in slightly accented Elven as they leave port. • Meena Pilwicken adjusts a clockwork device beside her steering wheel to track her route: she is engaged in a mapping project. • Dworic Rumnaheim hollers at one of the sailors on shore that he’ll be back in two days and hopes to see them at the Stout Friend tavern for dinner. Area 2: The Shallows As the land recedes behind you, sea gulls wheel overhead, occasionally diving into the water looking for ﬁsh. Sunlight sparkles on the tops of the waves. For the next few hours, the sailing is clear and the hired sailors can their rudder. They take a seat on a bench in the stern of the ship and each act as follows: • Jonas Crewe brieﬂy closes his eyes and savors the feeling of the wind on his face. • Meena Pilwicken plays a jaunty tune on a red-and-blue concertina. • Dworic Rumnaheim takes a swig of grog from a wicker-wrapped demijohn and then offers some to the characters. Dworic’s preferred grog recipe includes water, rum, lemon juice, and a touch of sugar. The Port Regan Lighthouse 4 Area 3: The Depths You enter deep water, the sea beneath the keel of your boat turning dark blue. After a while, the boat shudders slightly and you see a long, massive shadow at least 30 feet long moving past the boat. For a few moments, all is still. Then a tall ﬁn appears a dozen yards away, cutting through the water like a knife, and then rushes towards you! The sahuagins have stirred up a giant shark that lives in the ocean depths. It has come unusually close to the coast in search of a meal. We’re Going To Need A Bigger Boat (Medium Encounter) If there are only three characters in the party, reduce the giant shark’s Strength score to 19, which will give it a +7 attack bonus and reduce its damage to 21 (3d10 + 4). If there are ﬁve characters in the party, then the giant shark has 150 hit points and a Strength score of 25, granting it a +10 attack bonus, dealing 23 (3d10 + 7) damage on a hit. If reduced to 25 or fewer hit points, the shark leaves in search of less dangerous prey. Area 4: Approaching the Island The water grows less deep and you begin to see bars of green amid the blue. You spot a rocky island on the horizon with a grey tower on it. The island is about two miles away at this point and the party must decide how they intend to approach it. If they are sailing with a hired boat, the sailor can tell them that there are dangerous shoals about and that they plan to head for the pier on the northern side of the island. The Port Regan Lighthouse 5 Area 5: The Island The lighthouse sits on the southern end of a small island. There is a pier to allow boats to dock safely — the rocks below the water level are sharp and dangerous to ships — but it is possible to swim to the northern shore rather than landing at the pier to the east. Characters who do so have a 50% chance of encountering a pack of reef sharks that has been drawn to the island by the presence of the sahaguins. If the party contains 5 players, the sharks are accompanied by a swarm of unusually aggressive pilot ﬁsh. Sharks in the Water (Medium Encounter) Players Enemies 3 4 reef sharks 4 5 reef sharks 5 5 reef sharks and 1 quipper swarm A. Docks There is a short pier made of heavy timbers on the northwestern side of the island. At ﬁrst glance, you think that its surface has been painted grey-brown, but then your eye catches the movement and you realize that it is covered with dozens of tiny crabs clustered around several giant crabs the size of mastiffs. The sahuagins have placed these crabs here as a ﬁrst line of defense should the town send anyone to investigate. If the crabs spot the ship, they will swim over to it and attack. Dock Crabs (Medium Encounter) Players Enemies 3 3 giant crabs and 4 swarms of crabs 4 4 giant crabs and 4 swarms of crabs 5 5 giant crabs and 5 swarms of crabs See the appendix for statistics for the swarm of crabs. The Port Regan Lighthouse 6 B. Dock Supply Shed Adjoining the pier is a wooden shed with a weathered white paint job. The door is secured by a wooden bolt. The shed here contains several coils of rope as well as a waterproofed canvas tarp, carpentry tools, a few boards, and other basic supplies that might come in handy for patching up a damaged boat. The door is bolted to keep it closed during a storm but is easy to open. C. The Rocky Shore The island’s shore is made up of sharp stones covered in a thin layer of sand and littered with seaweed. The shore slopes up as you get farther from the water, eventually forming a hard, rocky surface held together by scraggly but resilient grass. The ground here is difﬁcult terrain owing to the sharp rocks. It isn’t safe to bring a boat up onto the shore here, but the water is calm enough for people to swim safely ashore. D. Lighthouse Supply Shed This wooden shed stands perhaps ten yards away from the lighthouse, its white paint chipped and ﬂecked with ominous splashes of red that you don’t think are paint. This shed stands to the north of the lighthouse. Canny characters can use it as a way to sneak up on the sahuagin guards at the lighthouse if they can roll a 16 or higher on their Dexterity (Stealth) roll. The door to the shed faces south and is bolted as a preventative measure against bad weather. Characters who open it can ﬁnd a few waterproofed tarps, a rope, a lantern, The Port Regan Lighthouse 7 several pints of oil, a handaxe, and other basic supplies that might prove useful if it were necessary to be out and about on the island during a storm. E. The Lighthouse You can see the lighthouse at the southern end of the island, its base built out of blue stone and the upper stories made of grey stone. It is four stories tall with a balcony wrapping around the third story and the fourth story consisting of many windows. At the entrance, you can see a group of scaly humanoid creatures with ﬁns and the faces of predatory ﬁsh. One of them, slightly smaller than the others, wears a collar made of dozens of polished black shark’s teeth. The sahuagin priestess Heptranqi and some sahuagins stand guard at the entrance to the lighthouse. If Heptranqi is slain and half the remaining sahuagins are dead, the survivors will attempt to ﬂee either into the lighthouse to raise the alarm (see area 6C) or back into the ocean. Sahuagin Guards (Hard Encounter) Players Enemies 3 1 sahuagin priestess, 2 sahuagins 4 1 sahuagin priestess, 4 sahuagins 5 1 sahuagin priestess, 5 sahuagins Carved over the entrance to the guard tower is a phrase in Primordial: From the ocean we came To the ocean our hearts belong. To the land we have come. From the land we look ever back. The lock on the door was broken when the sahuagins forced their way into the lighthouse. The door opens smoothly onto area 6B. The Port Regan Lighthouse 8 Area 6: The Lighthouse The lighthouse incorporates the ruins of an old triton guard tower that was once here, resulting in a patchwork of the bluish stone that the tritons favored and the grey granite that the Port Regan humans currently use. It was run by a team of four lighthouse keepers: Hogar Firekeeper (male half-orc), Tawna Lightstep (female halﬂing), Timm Seaver (male human), and Tyna Wildcloak (female halﬂing). The lighthouse was lit by a magic crystal made by dragonborn mages. The crystal is shaped like an egg with an intricate scaled surface; a long crack runs through its surface. It is currently broken but can be restored with the mending cantrip. When functional, the crystal absorbs sunlight during the day and can then release that light if someone touches it and gives the Draconic command phrase “Vær lys,” in which case the scales on the egg open and it radiates bright light for 500 feet and dim light for 1 additional mile. The crystal can be deactivated with the command phrase “Vær mørk.” Both command phrases are written on the base of the crystal. On a sunny day, the crystal could absorb enough light to glow for twenty-four hours before it needed recharging. A. Cellar The stone stairs lead down into a round chamber made of blue stones that have been carefully cut and ﬁtted together without the use of cement or mortar. In the center of the room is a massive round pillar that helps support the tower above. Crates and small barrels are stacked throughout the room with a particularly large cluster towards the northern side of the room. This chamber was built by the tritons as an armory but was used by the lighthouse keepers as a storage space for food, clothing, spare wicks, and fuel. Behind the barrels and crates is a stone door, which can be noticed either if characters move the crates or on an Intelligence (Investigation) roll of 15 or higher. The key is surrounded by a metal plate with an ornate carving of a pair of ﬁsh swimming in a circle. The lighthouse keepers have never been able to open the door (which requires a roll of 25 with thieves’ tools to open without the key) and so have piled their crates in The Port Regan Lighthouse 9 front of it to keep it from opening from the other side. Hexanqi has the key (see area C), which she found in the waters surrounding the island, but has not found the door. If the door is opened, it reveals an oval room with several sagging wooden cabinets in it. The air here smells stale, as the door seals tightly and has not been opened in centuries. Treasure Characters who search the armory can ﬁnd the following: • 1 suit of mariner’s half-plate etched with depictions of ocean creatures. The wearer can use an action to cause the eyes of the sea creatures to glow blue, shedding a bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, or to extinguish the light. •A cloak of the manta ray made of blue-black silk. Primordial words are sewn into its collar with blue-green thread, reading, The manta glides through deep water, choosing its course amid endless paths. • An elemental gem (emerald) that can be used to summon a water elemental. • 2 shortbows (nonfunctional; their bowstrings need replacing) and 2 quivers of 20 arrows each. Because of their archaic design, the bows are worth 4 extra gold pieces (29 gp rather than 25 gp) each and each arrow is worth an extra silver piece, resulting in a quiver of 20 arrows being worth 2 extra gold pieces (3 gp rather than 1 gp). The Port Regan Lighthouse 10 B. Entrance The door to the lighthouse opens to reveal a round room made of a mixture of blue and grey stone. For the most part, the lower third of the room is made of blue stone whereas the upper portions are made of grey stone, but the northern side of the room (where you entered) is entirely blue stone and large portions of the southern side are grey. Light is shed on the room by some glass windows set in the eastern wall. In the northeastern part of the room, just to your left as you come in, you can see a wooden and iron staircase spiraling up towards a trapdoor in the wooden ceiling above. In the southwestern side of the room, you can see a wooden trapdoor in the blue stone ﬂoor. This part of the tower still retains a part of the original triton stonework. A roll of 10 on an Intelligence (History) roll will reveal that the portions of the tower made of blue stone are signiﬁcantly older than the grey stone portions were built on top of them; a roll of 15 or higher will indicate that some substantial repairs were made to the blue stones using some of the same mortar and cement used in the grey stone portions. Tactically minded characters will notice that there are no windows in the blue stone (because the tritons built the tower for defensive purposes). Neither trapdoor is locked but has been put into place for safety reasons only. Characters who climb the staircase can hear Hexanqi and her minions in area C if they have a passive Perception of 14 or higher (or if they make a Wisdom (Perception) roll of 14 or higher). If the characters open the trapdoor in the northeastern corner, they see a stone spiral staircase leading down to the cellar (area A). The Port Regan Lighthouse 11 C. Lighthouse Keepers’ Quarters The trapdoor opens and you see a large round room made of grey stone interspersed with a few blue stones. Another staircase on the southwestern side of the room leads to a trapdoor in the wooden ceiling; the room is illuminated by large windows on each side. It was clearly once a comfortable living area with hammocks, some cabinets, and a writing desk. Much of the furniture has been smashed, however, and its wreckage has been assembled into a crude altar draped with seaweed in the southern part of the room. [A giant octopus at least eight feet in diameter clings to the wall over it, its skin glistening with mucous.] A group of the ﬁshlike creatures you saw before stand congregated around it, led by a ﬁgure wearing with a shark’s skull as a crown. It raises a severed human head before the altar and intones an eerie, warbling chant. The elder sahuagin priestess, Hexanqi, and her guards are here. The spell she is casting at the altar is intended to allow her to force the spirits of the dead lighthouse keepers to reveal what they knew about the triton tower and whether there are any weak points in the tower that she can use to destroy it. * If there are only three players, replace the octopus in the descriptive text with two giant crabs. Hexanqi is a sahuagin priestess with 5 extra hit points. Hexanqui’s Minions (Hard Encounter) Players Enemies 3 Hexanqi, 2 sahuagins, 2 giant crabs 4 Hexanqi, 3 sahuagins, 1 giant octopus 5 Hexanqi, 4 sahuagins, 1 giant octopus The bodies of the four lighthouse keepers lie in a corner. All of them are wearing suits of brown and white sailor’s cloth as well as a bronze pin depicting the lighthouse as a sign of their profession. Their heads have been cut off and their hearts removed as part of Hexanqi’s foul magic ritual. The Port Regan Lighthouse 12 Treasure Hexanqi has a tarnished metal key with an image of a ﬁsh on its handle that allows access to the remnants of the triton garrison’s armory (see area A), the magic crystal that illuminated the lighthouse (see area E), and an triton relic called an amulet of the salt sea (see appendix). Characters who examine the dead lighthouse keepers will ﬁnd that Hogar had a dragonborn-forged battleaxe and Tyna Wildcloak wore a ring of water walking. The rest of their effects are fairly minimal, but characters interested in looting what remains of their possessions will ﬁnd nine gold pieces, seventeen silver pieces, twenty-nine copper pieces, and a set of battered (and clearly well-loved) playing cards scattered throughout the chamber. D. Lookout You climb up the ladder and ﬁnd yourself in a room slightly smaller than the one below, its walls built of grey stone. The southern side of the room has two large windows that offer a commanding view of the Picaroon Sea. There is a bolted door on the northern side of the room that leads onto a stone balcony that encircles the entire tower. A stepladder in the northeastern side of the room leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling. A few boxes and barrels stand in a cluster to one side. The lighthouse keepers would come here to look out over the sea and (in fair weather) walk around the balcony. The space is also used to store supplies for the lantern, just in case the crystal fails to work satisfactorily. The Port Regan Lighthouse 13 E. Light Chamber The trapdoor opens onto a room with a short, vaulted ceiling. It has large windows of thick glass on all sides and a wooden pedestal in the center. A cushion lies in a heap on the northern side of the room. Hanging among the rafters at the top of the room is a large metal lantern, about ﬁve feet tall. A rope is tied to the southern side of the room that leads up towards the lantern. The magic crystal used to rest on the cushion here. If the party cannot mend the crystal, they can do what the lighthouse keepers would do if there wasn’t enough sunlight to charge the crystal: lower the lantern and use that instead. There is plenty of fuel for the lantern in the room below and more in the cellar. Conclusion Upon the party’s return to Port Regan, Captain Joan sends a team of guards out to the island to take charge of the situation. If the party has not mended the magic crystal, she has the guards retrieve it and bring it back to Port Regan, where she hands it over to the town wizards to repair it. She thanks them for their service and promises to keep them in mind for future work.

The Port Regan Lighthouse 15 AMULET OF THE SALT SEA Wondrous item, uncommon This brass amulet is set with a round, pale blue sapphire ﬂecked with white specks. The surface of the gem has been carved with an image of three ﬁsh swimming in a circle. While wearing it, you have a swimming speed of 40 feet. Additionally, you may choose to grant waterbreathing creatures with the Hold Breath trait (like an octopus) within 60 feet of you the Limited Amphibiousness trait, allowing them to survive outside the water for four hours so long as they are within 90 feet of you. The effect ends if you die or lose the amulet, granting the creatures 1 minute to return to the water before they suffocate. Similarly, you may grant creatures that already have the Limited Amphibiousness trait (such as a sahuagin) the Amphibious trait as long as they are within 90 feet of you, allowing them to survive outside the water indeﬁnitely. If you die or lose the amulet, the effect ends and the creatures have 10 minutes to return to the water or they will start to suffocate.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
