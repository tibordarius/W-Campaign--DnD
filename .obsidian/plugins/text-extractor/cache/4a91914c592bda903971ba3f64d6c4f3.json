The Adarbrent clan plans to make Tarmalune their new home and leave Waterdeep. Rolling (dc 11) CHR will allow the Adarbrent clan think about employing the adventurer if they so choose. Let the Adventurers have the opportunity to interact with each other or the NPCs to tell their back story and what their main purpose is to leave Fearun and go to Mazteca. Have the adventurers explain any relationships with any of the others or start to form alliances as they find out more of their back stories. Tarmalune Interests: Use this information for background on the location for the voyage port. This information is known to all on the cruise. Tarmalune has been described as a thriving metropolis and ruled by a twenty-member Council of Tarmalune. The council will accept a law if 12 of the members vote to pass it. 1479 Speaker Hamminas Dorn heads the council. The city has no standing army, but the Vigilant act as the city watch. The Firequench Order are a cabal of wizards, and they keep extremely secretive. Members wear purple robes and mask their faces. They are well liked by the populace because they act as the city’s fire fighters, magically extinguishing any fires in the city. The Vigilant are the city’s watch made up of nearly 100 veteran officers and a large number of “trainees”. Members wear a uniform consisting of black leather armor and black helms. • Gasker Haerocloak is a necromantic wizard that does not claim to be in the Firequench. • Halagothra the Healer is an old woman that has natural healing powers and is not a priestess. Rather than coin, she requires service from those she heals. • Rathgar Malynd is a mercenary captain who leads the Battle Hound Mercenary company. They are known for the ruthlessness and is openly critical of the Vigilant. • Tammes Eldrake is a kindly human wizard and known to champion the poor and is suspicious of the Firequench Order. Ardenmore – Named for the Gnomish builder Arden, this ward houses the city’s most opulent mansions. Copperstreets – Many of the city’s laborers and shopkeepers live in this ward. Dawnside – This ward is inhabited by Tarmulane’s newly Rich. 3 Fishstink – This ward is the home to fishermen and fishmongers and smells like its name. Maerhavel – A well to-do residential ward of successful merchants. The Raging Flame – a one-hundred-foot- tall cylinder of flame of unknow origin. Surroundings: Location: The adventure takes place on a luxurious ship headed to the new continent of New Abier (Laerakond). Setting sails to Tarmalune, the largest of the Windrise Ports. Inhabitants of Waterdeep want to make new trade relations with this new and mysterious lands. The flagship Hippocampus is a very impressive vessel and looks to provide an amazing journey across the ocean. It looks to be a large Caravel with 50/14 complement. Use 50 Veterans for the complement, 14 use Champions. Weather: The day starts off very mild and sunny. A perfect day to set sail with the wind just right to give the ship maximum speed. The journey should be a week or so depending on the seas between the ports. Sounds: The port is filled with sounds of ships and people working, talking and most prominent the fanfare from the celebration of this virgin cruse. The ship leaves the docks with a loud and very festive ceremony. Drinks and food are in full supply as the shipping company wants to recruit many new employees. Several nobles are in attendance as well with the same plans to setup shipping and trade in Tarmalune. The thought of a new world with new products and new customers is appealing to most of the high nobles. The trip along the ocean proves to be very tempting to anyone that wants to join the ranks of all who are in attendance, shop owners are looking for knowledge in their trade to head the new shops that they plan to establish. Food, Drink and companionship is not in short supply. The main deck is decorated and temporary bartenders are setup to serve any needs. The captain is on hand in the main gallery. A large party has been setup in the gallery with the nobles in rare form. The Foc’s’le Deck has many of the same decorations and luxuries of the gallery. Every entrance has guards and there are several guard patrols on the main deck, gun deck and quarter/ Foc’s’le decks. Villainy is not tolerated within this crowd of very wealthy. The hold is not a massive jail, few of guards heavily monitored it. These guards are not your normal guards, but well trained Veterans and Champions. The guards and crew of the ship will be formable in any battle. This creates a sense of great security and it would seem that the nobles made sure their money and themselves were safe by paying the best from the Waterdeep guards to be part of the crew. Days go by without incident and the beauty of the Sea is calming as the adventurers feel themselves get closer to their destiny in this new land of opportunity. The time will pass by quickly as there is only the vast sea to admire on the voyage. Information and new relationships should be gathered during this time as the adventurers build their claim on the new world they are about to visit. Fill the days of the voyage with interactions on what is expected from the adventurers and describe the new lands. These will be the bonds that will lead the adventurers path of success. A special celebration with the Captain, the Dinner with the Captain is planned on the Third night during the voyage. The best 4 that the chefs can offer will be on display and lots of drink to wet the pallets as well. Be ready to meet the crew and passengers on this glorious night of celebration. Travel Timelines: The travel will use the following timeline and allow the players to interact using their back story. Allow the following for the main timeline of the voyage, but also allow changes based on the adventurer’s role playing. • Launch day: The crew and passengers gather in the morning and board the ship. Introductions and settling aboard make up the day as the ship heads off and the celebration launch concludes. • Day 1 – A time for interaction and investigation is in order for the day. This is the best time to get the sea legs and start to interact with noted NPCs. • Day 2 – The day for realization and experimentation as the sea gets deeper, so does the alliances formed. Members of the Zhentarim Alliance will be alerted to the Secret in the Shadows. • Day 3 – This is the day of reckoning, as the day goes by without any excitement other than the Secret of the Shadows. Rogues will be involved in the small incursion that leads to interrogation. • Night fall of Day 3 – The adventurers find out how harsh the sea can be. Notable NPCs on the ship: Talana Taenfeather – a member of the Waterdeep Guard, an elite unit of the city watch. Fastest member of the guard. 4 body guards are along with her for the trip. Laryllia Adarbent – Laryllia is a spitfire with flaming red hair, the temper and tenacity to match. A born seafarer, Laryllia is the captain of the Hippocampus, flagship of the Horizon Armada and a member of those who Harp. Feluna Moonstar: Feluna (NG female afflicted werecat [augmented Illuskan human] cleric 5 [Selûne]) is the young, almost ethereally beautiful sister of Lord Rober. She evinces many of the personality traits commonly associated with felines, including a strong streak of independence, a nocturnal bent, and a hunter's mindset. Feluna first manifested her lycanthropic abilities during the Time of Troubles after being kidnapped and left bound and gagged in the sewers for several days. The Moonmaiden answered her pleas for aid by transforming her into a cat. She now serves at the House of the Moon as one of the Called, having grown comfortable with her newfound abilities. Noble House Macen Ettesrain: Known for goods and services, Man Jusetauv , two Younger men Baron and Percy the nephews of the man and a niece Linnet. 4 guards 3 suspicous characters: Ressic Ophal, Yladhra the Grim, Maknis, using Rouges from the Shadow Thieves, on (DC 17 Perception check) or if a character would have underground ties would know that these men are Rogues, (DC 18 Perception check) or if the adventurer has ties with Shadow Thieves would know them and be a part of the heist. (There is Something in the Shadows). 5 12 Horizon Armada Crew Members: 12 of the best veterans that perform tasks as the crew of the Hippocampus. They are all well trained sailors and fighters. They serve as guards, ship’s galley, and able seamen. Travel Developments: Allow the adventurers to participate in the festivities as according to their class and alignment. Most of them will have a non- eventful time, if they so choose, the adventurers can interact in the following way: During the cruise, the adventurers can interact in many ways. There are a few items that are mainly available to the group as the days go by. Get too drunk and arrested only to find themselves in the galley for drunk and disorderly. Rolling a (DC 14 Constitution check) fails and the adventurer will be intoxicated. Further DC fails while enjoying the drinks will place the intoxication level even higher until the adventurer passes out and is taken to the hold for sleeping it off. Talk to the nobles for employment, finding themselves on the Foc’s’le deck talking business and money. The nobles are very happy to see that they have a dependable adventurer on their side and ask the adventurers to follow them to a more private area to discuss the details of pay and job descriptions. Based on the adventurer’s class the job description will entail what the adventurer excels at. Chasing the The Shadow Thieves, a secret cult that is ready to make this trip and eventful one. The mission details for “There is Something in the Shadows” are started on the 3rd day just before the invasion. Depending on the ties to the Shadow Thieves, the adventurer could be part of the distraction or see that this is a planned distraction on a (DC 16 Investigation). Otherwise a small brawl ensues and the guards leave their posts to stop the tussle. A (DC 15 Perception) will notice a figure sneak past the guards and head down to the lower ship levels. The guards apprehend the adventurer and any others that are interacting in the disturbance and will be placed in the hold until the disturbance can be cleared up. Paraphrase the following and let the characters interact as they feel, rolling a d20 every interval of 5 will allow the adventurers hear one of the following, do not repeat the information on rolls. • Laryllia Adarbent - Do you like this ship, says the Admiral? We found an engineer from Tarmalune, who has great new ideas on how to make this ship strong and fast. We have made several adjustments to guarantee the safety of our passengers. We have Safety Launches, that can withstand the seas. Even if the boat sinks our launches can house passengers until they get to dry land. You will want to be in one if we are ever attacked. • Noble House Macen Ettesrain - Our routes currently include travels to the far lands of Evermeet for the brave scholars or legendary adventurers. The Green Isle has made us aware that Mazteca has been transformed since the terrible events of the past. A whole new continent resides where Mazteca has been, we call it Laerakond (the New Abier). We have been given a map from the Elf scholars to a port in Tarmalune of the Sword Lands. It is our hope to 6 find dock there and build a new trade route to the wondrous new resources that it may have. • Feluna Moonstar- The House of Adarbrent is in disarray after several years and losses from the past. Fahd yn Sarsor al Nisr has bailed out the company, but member of the Adarbrent clan want control back and are willing to go to any extreme to open new trade routes and severe their ties with Waterdeep. Finding new ports in Tarmalune is a promising enterprise adventure for the clan. They still have ties with Master’s Mariners Guild and work with the Harpers. • Talana Taenfeather- Please stay out of the Business of the guards. They will save you from any attack or disaster. Make sure you find safety in the Launch if there is an attempt on the ship. • Only the best sailors can set sail on the Hippocampus. We are trained for battle and weathering the madness of the open ocean. Long journeys are our specialty with a long history of safe passage across the sea. This would be our longest journey to date and we are excited to see the new lands and possibly setup home fronts there along with our Waterdeep homes. • I have head stories of an Adarbrent descendant leaving Waterdeep to explore the sea to the west and never return. The house is in disarray and may not be able to come back from such devastation. There are rumors of a hostile takeover and they would benefit with the relocation to New Abier. • With all of these nobles and riches on the ship, it is a question of when we will be attacked or robbed in any way and not IF. There are suspicious passengers on board that I do not trust and seem to have difficulty finding them at times. Secrets are whispered on every deck so be vigil to any suspicious activity you see and report it immediately to the guards. • The guard and crew are preparing for a great feast. The Dinner with the Captain is a special event to welcome everyone together as they form these new relationships with the new world and these new friends. Everyone is welcome to eat and drink. Bards will play as everyone dances and it is a great time to introduce yourselves to everyone on the cruise. The festival will take a few days to prepare and any help is welcome. After the initial interaction with the NPCs and other PCs during the Captain’s Dinner, excitement starts to ensue. A commotion starts off and there is a scuffle that drags several of the passengers into a brawl. The food and drink seem to be too much for the passengers and/or the adventurers. The guards will help break up the fights and escort anyone to the brig to help sleep off any intoxication. Member of the Zhentarim or adventurers that roll perceptions to see the real events of the evening will lead them to the brig or on deck with the captain. An investigation (DC 19 investigation) will alert an adventurer that a shadowed creature (cat like) is wandering into the Captain’s quarters. Once on the deck of the ship a (DC 10) Perception will indicate that there are several ships headed toward the Hippocampus. Alert the guards and prepare for an attack. This is a good point to start ship combat and keep it up until 7 the boats reach the ship. There are also several large creatures attacking the ship. As there was a large altercation during Dinner, there are not a lot of crew men to help with sailing the ship. Adventurers that have nautical backgrounds are welcomed to help with the chase from the attacking war canoes. “Captain! There are boats gaining on us!” A voice from the Foe’sle Deck loudly alerts the crew as the skies start to close within large clouds of Tempest anger. Lightning and thunder deafening …“Just Over the Bow! Make maneuvers now and get the passengers to safety” … A large shadow in the sea roars as the winds and waves begin to crash on the ship’s hull. This would be a great time to seek shelter and everyone is willing to climb into the lower decks for safety. The chase is on, as the boats race to get within reach for the pirates to catch their prey in the sea. Creatures from the sea’s shadows start to climb the ship, making their way to the cabin’s and other areas of the boat. Screaming and chaos start to unfold as the Crew try to stop the invasion. Encounter at Sea: A well-organized attacked begins on the ship. Several invaders climb onto the main deck and start to capture and rob the nobles on the ship. This happens at the same time as a mysterious figure in a boat wielding a magic device seemingly controlling a monstrous sea creature. The magic device seems to have control over all of the sea creatures and the largest of them start to attack the ship. Sharks start to ram the hull as other large sea creatures ram the hull. Boats full of minions pull aside the ship and attempt to climb onto the decks. Use the naval battle stats to maneuver the ship and rally the sailors. The ship may not be fast enough for the war canoes but it will give the adventurers some experience with naval warfare. They attack and knock out most of the nobles and passengers starting to tie them as sea monsters and giant octopi grab the captives carrying them away. The night sky makes it difficult to see where these creatures are headed and how many there are. It is a flank tie and grab scenario. The adventurers can assist or in the event that they are in jail watch the attack on the ship. The Triton Arch Mage calls forth a giant sea creatures to sink the boat. Minions of creatures called Sea Spawns under the wizard’s control invade the ship. Mostly interested in taking hostages and robbing the loot from the ship, the invaders do not spend time attacking only defending if they are approached. The attackers do not kill, only do nonlethal damage on anyone, only to tie them up and take them hostage. The guards though, do not comply to non- lethal and fight to the death. Conclusion: The ship would not be able to outrun the War Canoes that chase them down. Several sea creatures have been making progress in damaging the ship along with trying to injure a passenger that falls into the depths of the ocean. 8 There is a mysterious figure on a great sea beast. Roll History check (DC 15), Aboleth swims by with a cloaked figure, Triton Arch Mage. The ship has been destroyed and looted and the adventurers find themselves on the captured or (DC 13 below) unconscious. Any adventurer that has saved a noble will have favor and immediate employment if the noble needs the adventurer’s help. The Noble’s Saving Grace award will allow the adventurer advantage and extreme good favor with dealing with the Nobles of Tarmalune or Waterdeep with that Noble’s clan. Zhentarim Secret Mission There is Something in the Shadows The mysterious men on the ship that no one seems to know about are of the following use the following stats to play these NPCs: The Zhentarim have interest in building more trade routes to the new land. There is information kept in the Captain’s quarters that could be beneficial to the Zhentarim and they are willing to get it at any cost. They have hired 3 Shadow Thieves of Waterdeep and the help of any adventurer that is of Zhentarim Faction. Key contacts for any trade routes and information on these contacts are crucial for beginning trade talks. The Hippocampus has already gotten the upper hand with setting up talks to key members of the New Abier Vigilant. The Vigilant work as the high guard of Tarmalune and can be very helpful if they are contacted first. The identities of these contacts will allow the Zhentarim to have first contact and build any new shipping routes to benefit the Zhentarim. A key to the Vigilant is a letter to the leader from the Vigilant asking for audience with anyone that has enough power to forge an alliance and help them with their cause to gain a more powerful hold on Tarmalune and is found in the captain’s diary. The Battle Hound Mercenary company has become a problem for the Vigilant leadership and this letter gives the location of Rathgar Malynd their leader. They ask for a no questions asked, deal with the issue. This is all explained in the letter the can be found in the Captain’s secret diary. Members of the Zhentarim Faction are visited immediately after the launch and told of their mission objective. The plan devised by the Shadow Thieves is to create a diversion and have the guards distracted, so that they can get into the captain’s quarters to investigate. The rogues are prepared with any lock picking or other skills needed to enter the captain’s quarters, the adventurers only need to assist in the distractions. The distraction should be enough to provide a small window of opportunity for the Shadow Thieves effort to grab the letter and note the location of Rathgar. Yladhra the Grim will bear the responsibility of getting to the diary and if the adventurer has interactions during the initial 2 days of the voyage can gather intel for her. This will certainly gain favor for the Shadow Thieves. Otherwise the adventurers will help in causing a large brawl in the galley or deck so that a lot of 9 guards will be forced to call upon the captain and haul everyone to the brig. There should be 12 officers and 4 body guards, during the captain’s dinner on the 3rd day (noted event of the voyage) everyone could be distracted enough to give way to the plan. Once the information is claimed, the Zhentarim Faction must be alerted with this information.

Naval Tactics: Use naval tactics as a guide when groups are battling or fleeing in boats. Captain/First Mate • Rally. Allow player to intimidate/inspire the crew once per battle for an advantage on a roll. Make a Charisma check with a DC of 10 (or higher if crew is disloyal or in real trouble). • Weak Spot. Allow player to look for a weakness in the defenses of the enemy’s vessel. Make an Intelligence check with a DC of 15 (adjust for conditions) to spot a weakness and give advantage on the next attack roll that targets that weakness Pilot • Have the pilot make a Dexterity check to make sure they are controlling the ship well, failure can result in the ship slowing, not turning, etc. • The helm must be controlled by a player or NPC or the ship will be drifting. • For pilot checks you can add the pilot’s DEX modifier and proficiency to the roll, if they are a skilled pilot. You could make sailing proficiency part of a feat, added to Sailor background or something that you add to the PCs background. 10 • As an optional rule you can add the pilot’s DEX modifier to the AC of the ship if they are a skilled pilot. Spellcasters – have them make their own attacks, put out fires, mend the ship, etc. Surgeons – A ship’s surgeon must have some kind of clerical/healing skill. The surgeon can restore 1 crew member per turn, DC 10 with any related modifiers added on. Boarding and Ramming Use the following rules for boarding and ramming. Boarding. The act of bringing your ship up against/alongside an enemy ship with the goal of capturing or destroying it. • The easiest way to think about boarding is to treat it like a grapple attack with advantage. • To board an enemy vessel the pilot must first approach the enemy ship. Have the pilot make a DC 10 pilot check. If the boat is disabled, this can be lower. If the other ship is under full control and evading the attacking ship, make the DC higher. • You can have the players use their own actions to aid in the boarding attack by using grappling hooks, employing boarding nets, swinging over on ropes or dropping a bridge. • Come up with a DC based on conditions and have the captain roll (grapple check by pilot) • A ship can attempt to free itself with an opposed pilot check rolled with disadvantage. Set the DC based on conditions. • Once boarding has occurred, normal melee rules apply. Ramming. To ram a ship is to simply hit your ship into the enemy ship. • You must be at least 30′ away from the other boat and end your turn reaching the other ship. • Attack: 1d20 + proficiency + dexterity (or 1d20+6 for simplicity) versus the AC of the other ship or versus a pilot check (your choice). If a ship has limited mobility you should provide advantage or make this a simply pilot check. • Damage: Speed of Boat (in feet per round) x 1d4 bludgeoning damage, the ramming ship takes half of the damage to itself • Example: 30′ x 1d4 (rolled 3) = 30 x 3 = 90 hp bludgeoning damage to enemy ship, 45 hp bludgeoning damage to attacking ship • If the attacking ship has a battering ram you might want to let them roll a d6 and take less damage. A war canoe will attach to the ship and a pirate raiding party will invade the ship to take over and steal the ship. 5 Sahuagin, 1 Sahuagin Captain and 2 Sea Spawn jump aboard the ship and try to subdue the crew and passengers. There is a Launch boat to make an escape if necessary (complements of 8/1/2) The nobles are first to be put in Launches and released if the ship is in danger of being taken over. The sea serpent will not attack the Launches, thought the pirates will try to take them over and make them surrender. The minions and sea creatures attack the Launches and take them off into the 11 darkness. Use naval combat the flee from the attackers and their war canoe. The battle is furious, however at the end of the battle the ship is torn to pieces by the giant sea creatures and wizard flying on a Wyvern. Adjusting the Encounter Here are recommendations for adjusting this combat encounter. These are not cumulative: • Very Weak Party: Remove Sahuagin Captain • Weak Party: Replace 2 Sea Spawns with Sahuagin. • Strong Party: Add 1 Sea Spawn • Very Strong Party: Add 2 Sahuagin Captains This encounter is made to overwhelm the adventurers and at any time they have an advantage in the fight use the following as a guide for more creatures: a total of 5 war canoes combine the invading force. Each war canoe can have 5 Sahuagin, 1 Sahuagin Captain and 2 Sea Spawns Pirates, and space for 7 captives. The war canoes are equipped with ropes and shackles, magic shackles are used on magic users and all of the Sahuagin have been setup to see Magic with detect magic. 12 Part 2: Temporary Assignment The adventurers find themselves captured and in cages along the shore of a small island. The Sahuagin have setup a temporary detention camp for all of the captives on the ship. The looks of things show that this is not the first time they have done this and signs of what their intent is obvious. The adventurers are in a makeshift cell made of bamboo and twine, this could be an easy escape attempt, if a plan can be devised by the adventures. There are not as many Sahuagin at the camp, they are seen taking their war canoes to another Island in the far distance. The encampment looks like and abandoned village with several worn huts, a (DC 15 history check) identifies this to be a village of what could be natives of the islands and not built by the pirates. Throughout the day, captives are taken into a large tent/hut. They seem to come back beaten and bloody. Some do not comeback. The captives that come back seem to be lethargic and quiet. Getting information from them is difficult as they seem to be waking from a deep sleep and can only remember getting pushed into the tent/hut. Sahuagin are seen leaving in war canoes, it can be assumed that the captives that do not come back are being taken to another island. War canoes and Pinnaces are sparse. Boats of any kind are not available and the Island looks to be in a far off deserted area. Shapes of larger Islands can be seen in the horizon but the activity from the Sahuagin allows the belief that they are actually converging on one main large Island. There are few Sahuagin here, only enough to deal with the captives at hand. The area in the small encampment is sparse as well, it only looks to be temporary and notably disconnected from the other Islands by purpose. Making an escape very demanding, since the only place to go would be to the Larger Island that obviously inhabited by the Sahuagin and others that architected the attack on the Hippocampus. The island is one of the smaller islands in the area, it is still pretty impressive. It could take 7 days on foot to transverse along this side of the island and there is a massive jungle along a high mountain. Various animal sounds can be heard on the island that would indicate your average fauna can be found in the jungle. There does not seem to be any wild animal activity in this encampment. The advantage of the jungle would indicate that wild animals would have no reservation on attacking the Sahuagin or the adventurers. Animal handling could be a factor if encountering a wild beast. There is indication around the encampment that the Sahuagin have lost a few battles with the local wild life, but they are winning the war. There are half of the numbers from the Hippocampus on the shores in cages. There are a few familiar faces in the bamboo cells. The guards are mostly unconscious and bleeding, some are weary and have not recollection on what has happened, especially ones that visit the tent/hut. Laryllia Adarbent is in the cell with the adventurers and is trying to formulate an escape attempt. She confides with the adventurers her idea. The guards are cautious on how many captives they take to the hut, and keep the strength of the numbers to the fewest calculation. Laryllia seems to think they will underestimate her strength and when 13 they escort her into the hut, she will strike a revolt and with help from others maybe subdue the guards. It will take strategy and cunning with the bare hand and flying feet. Magic would help, but any components, holy symbols or focus items are gone. It would be difficult for a magic user to cast spells without components or focus items since they have seemed to take away any magic focus. There is a figure in the shadows cast by the jungle. No one seems to notice this figure so a (DC 17) Perception would only indicate that a humanoid is hiding in the jungle and investigating the encampment. It looks like persuasion could be used to assist in an escape attempt. The adventurers would need a good idea on how to get the attention or not depend on this help. Jusetauv, Baron, and Percy are missing and young Linnet is in the cage crying. She is intent in finding her uncle and brothers, but does not know what happened to them after they went into the Hut. She is begging someone for help and is at the brink of hysteria. Her tears are saddening as others that are captive are also in need to know where the others are gone. Activity in the Hut. The guards bring the captives into the Hut, it is very dark inside and you can see tribal runes, statues and religious items. A high cleric is seated in a throne near the rear of the hut. Chains and shackles are on the floor ready for use and the guards start to restrain the group they escorted into the tent/hut. Kney Ghan, a Priestess/Shaman inspects the captives one by one, they are made to sit on their knees tied as she walks by them slowly casting Geas on each of the captives. The Priest/Shaman will make small talk, if they don’t understand her then she will cast Comprehend Languages to understand them. Then Tongues on the adventurers to cast Geas. One by one, banter and beating happens while the priest asks her questions. A while goes by as the priest tries to understand what the real story is for all of the adventurers. Some of the captives are told to go away and work as slaves. The Geas spell affects them and the captives obey every word due to the spell that lasts forever, it is cast at 9th level. It has to be removed by a remove cure, greater restoration or wish spell. The Geas spell does not allow any action to result in death or it will break the spell. Common work like mining or cleaning, organizing is perfect for captives that need to categorize items stolen from the ships they have robbed. Roleplaying Kney Ghan Kney Ghan is a ruthless and evil priestess. Her words are direct and does not leave the fate of the victims a secret. She loves to toy with her prey as she enlightens them with what is about to happen. The priestess is very intelligent and a long survivor of extreme hardships that has hardened her demeanor. While the prisoners are in her presence, her words are harsh and precise. Threats are easy for her and the powerful magic she possesses makes any threat a fearful one. Quote: “…It truly hurts me that you are not cooperating, I will have to show you what happens to those who refuse my offer..” Opportunity here to interact with the adventurers to learn more about their back story. Kney Ghan will try to get into their minds and pry out any information that will benefit the pirates and then turn the captives into willing participants or slaves for the wizard to deal with. 14 Additional Information: Information that Kney Ghan will offer as the interrogation continues. • There is a massive crew of pirates that have been recruited by the Priestess and her minions. These pirates are victims of past takeovers and weak minded as they are easily swayed by Kney Ghan’s threats. • People that are resistant are turned into slaves and sent to the main island that is just across the sea from them. Most of the slaves work to repair the ships that the Triton Archmage captures or helps mine the minerals needed for survival on the islands. • The bounty that is collected by the pirates are kept stored on a main island. The island is the largest one at this location and numerous smaller islands surround it. Most of the smaller islands are used to “condition slaves” or recruit pirates. Captives that have sailor backgrounds are encouraged to join and become wealthy beyond imagination. Failure to join will cost them their lives. • An example will always be made when the priestess interrogates the captives. She will call it the sacrifice for knowledge and the entire sequence will be to find that one who will suffice in proving her point that resistance will only lead to death. • Those who do not cooperate with either working in the forced labor camps or joining the pirates can be abandoned on one of the smaller islands. These Islands are very dangerous and have hostile indigenous creatures. The numbers of which are unknown and few have survived encounters with them to provide details. • Some of the local islanders have been enslaved or offered as sacrifices. There are certain areas where they have lived and are now taken over by the pirates and used as camps, much like this one. The priestess is quick to point out that there are no survivors who can provide history on these matters. There seems to be some activity just outside the camp as loud animal sounds are heard from inside the tent where the captives have been interrogated. A loud roar is heard as the guards and other pirates yell warnings to each other. Cries of “It’s back” are heard by everyone and the priestess suddenly takes action, leaving the captives alone in the tent still subdued. “…ROAR!” A loud roar is heard as it echoes from the mountainous jungle deep inside of the island. A huge rock slams into the ground just feet from the entrance of the hut that the prisoners are and the Pirates scramble to gather their weapons and retreat from this make shift village. Kney Ghan shouts “Everyone to the main island! Kill the prisoners and run!” Laryllia Adarbent notices that it is time to make her move as the priestess runs outside, rolling DC (survial check 11) shows that she is abandoning everyone as the dangers of the islands are upon the camp. She attempts to break free from her shackles and if there are any captives that could pick a lock, she would ask them to assist to free everyone. 15 The time it takes to attempt to get free of the shackles, a battle begins outside as large beasts growl and bash at the pirates. A few Pirates are thrown through the air and pound the ground with a violent force. The group sees a Huge Beast with a large rock, growling and heaving the rock with ease at the ships during their escape. A giant sea creature emerges from the ocean with 3 long tentacles, grabbing at the huge ape. The priestess jumps on top of the Aboleth and shouts a command and the creature tosses the Ape into the village. More roars come from the trees in the jungle as the pirates and priestess make a mad escape from the village leaving everyone behind to face the islands native fauna. The shackles require a set of thieves’ tools and a Dexterity DC 15 check to unlock. The characters and Larryllia must make an Intelligence DC 18 (Investigation) check to find thieves’ tools. If they fail they are still shackled when the Tabaxi arrive. There are 4 Giant Apes at the feet of the mountain and the village, all of them start to fling huge boulders as if they were pebbles at the fleeing pirates and are able to crush a few of the escaping war canoes. As the pirates start to disappear in the distance, out of the boulder’s reaches, the apes bang on their chests and shout at the sky, waring the pirates to never show foot on the beach again. The priestess makes an angry gesture at the apes and turns to head into the distant waters, yelling “I will return to rid the island of you creatures.” After a long period of roars and stomps, the apes retreat back into the trees of the jungle. The silence is deafening after the mass exodus of the pirates and roars from the giant beasts. A Wisdom DC 14 (Survival) check alerts the adventurers of a presence in the jungle. A group of Tabaxi are hiding in the jungle foliage and are very cautious of any survivors. Any Charisma 17 (Persuasion) check will gain trust with the Tabaxi. The leader of the Tabaxi Jelutong Panther is welcoming to the adventurers once she is convinced they are not with the pirates. If the adventurers have not escaped the shackles at the time of the Tabaxi camp search, they roll Persuasion with advantage. Jelutong is a tall and powerful looking female cat, humanoid. Her skin is a very shiny black and her physic is rather muscular for a Tabaxi. She is traveling with several other Tabaxi, 40 in total. The following is what Jelutong the Lioness offers as information to the adventurers. Rollplaying Jelutong Panther Jelutong Panther is a strong woman, she is also very friendly and inquisitive. She dresses in the finest Tabaxi tribal gear, adorned with the wealth of items she has collected while adventuring. She is always seeking knowledge, especially when it is about something wondrous. Her expressions have a pleasant beauty and anyone that looks upon her strong physic is enamored by her. Her powerful eyes and happy demeanor make her very attractive to anyone she meets. Her Hunt is similar in physic and appearances, they are Dark black, very much like the panther and have sharp powerful claws. All of them feel at home in the jungle and can easily climb the trees and mountains found here. Quote: “…Oh don’t stop, please tell me more about your home, it is wonderfully exciting to learn more about its mysteries.” • We have traveled the world in search of treasures and returned home to share 16 our stories and wealth of knowledge of Faerun. Our surprise was finding that our home had been demolished and enslaved. • There are no signs of our elders and only a few of the villagers have been accounted for. This island was our ancient home, hidden from the world so that we could enjoy our freedom. The Jungle Mountain clan has claimed these mountains for thousands of years to store our adventures and treasure for the future of the Tabaxi clan. • We have a temple far inside the jungle, expertly hidden from any one that may venture here, we may find clues to where our elders have been taken and could find refugees if there are any still alive from our clan. • Riches from across Faerun are kept in our vaults and these islands have been our home along with the great beasts that live here. We do not know what happened here, because we have been on a lengthy adventure to obtain this Rare Wonderous Item: Folding Boat (DM has stats). We intended to share this item with our Hunt so that we could travel to places that we have only dreamed about. When we returned to the Jagtropogus Islands we found that our people were gone and our villages had been ransacked. We suspect it is the pirates. After the Tabaxi tell of their history they ask for your help to find their people and they offer to assist with traveling to your intended destination. Laryilla agrees to help and asks the adventurers to join her. She tells the Tabaxi that her people are also missing. Jelutong informs the adventurers to head toward the far Island just across the sea, it is the largest of all of the islands and travel to the Volcano near the northern end of the island. She suspects that is where the pirates have fled to and thinks this is where they can find the missing villagers. There are very little resources here for the adventurers and only a few weapons and armor. The Tabaxi indicate that they have a village down the coast of this island about a Ten Day down the coast. It could be advantageous for the group to travel there to find help with the rescue. The Tabaxi do not offer to show the group their temple, but will meet them at this village after they have found enough items to journey into the main island to attempt a recon on what has happened to the people of the island, as well as the people from the ship. 17 Part 3: All Washed up The adventurers now find themselves along the beach of an island. After traveling a 10 day along the coast they will have opportunity for encounters based on the following. The group can search for the debris during the walk along the beach to the village, and follow encounter A with an Intelligence (DC 12) Investigation shows that the debris looks to be from several large boats. Chests are easily opened with a rock or other item Locks have AC 4 HP 10; the locks are rusty and brittle. Around the village is a large forest and mountainous range, the other side is the beach open sea. The village is a medium sized community that looked to have had over 100 inhabitants but there is no one here and any tracks are gone through time. If the group searches the village, they will find a pile of items near the edge of the village close to the tree line. Follow encounter B. If the group searches the inside of the village huts inside the main village area have them follow encounter C. Encounter A - Beachline: The adventurers search in the debris that is washed ashore. There are floating chests, and bits of ship floating in the waist deep waters along the way to the village if they travel along the shore. A Wisdom (DC 15) Perception check will alert the group to 4 Giant Crabs that are scourging in the debris floating on the shore. A failure will only indicate large rock like features in the sand and the crabs will surprise attack when a creature enters their space. If the party goes on unnoticed, they can open chests for the treasure listed for Encounter A. The crabs will wander behind the party as they open the chests, if they back track, then it is likely they will step on one. Adjusting the Encounter A Here are recommendations for adjusting this combat encounter. These are not cumulative: • Very Weak Party: Remove 1 giant crab. • Weak Party: Remove remove 1 giant crab and the nature check is at a disadvantage. • Strong Party: Add 1 Giant Crab during the second round with no surpise. • Very Strong Party: Add 1 Giant Crab during the second round as a surprise round. Encounter B – Tabaxi Rubble The adventurers search the village for items and see an area where there is an area where there are a few pirate corpses and a stack of weapons. A small destroyed area about 15 ft., wide and 20 ft., long in an oblong shape is made up of fallen weapon racks, various broken chests and other pieces of debris. An Intelligence DC 14 (Nature) check indicates this is a poisonous snake pit. 1 swarm of poisonous snakes and 2 Giant poisonous snakes reside in the nest of weapons and debris. A Save will allow the adventurers to surprise the snake swarm, a failure will alert them of the presence of the adventurers but not start to attack, or a critical failure will have the swarm surprise the adventurers. 18 Adjusting the Encounter B Here are recommendations for adjusting this combat encounter. These are not cumulative: • Very Weak Party: Remove 1 Giant Poisonous Snake and give advantage to the party on the Nature check. • Weak Party: Remove 1 Giant Poisonous Snake. • Strong Party: Add 1 swarm of poisonous snakes during the second round. • Very Strong Party: Add 1 swarm of poisonous snakes during the second round as a surprise. Encounter C – The Armory The adventurers can search the inside of the huts, as they search they notice a large hut that is marked with strange letters, an Intelligence DC 10 (Investigation) will show them that a weaponry was once here. The entry and main area of the weaponry are emptied and dark. There are broken windows and slivers of the sunlight create a dimly light room that stretches for about 100 ft., by 80 ft., with a few rooms along the left and right sides. There are fighting dummies and archery targets along the walls and to the end of the building. It looks long deserted but there are several arrows along the far side wall and in the targets, swords are leaned against the dummies and there is cob webs along the ceiling. An Intelligence DC 16 (Nature) check will indicate that these are fresh spider webs and a save will show the adventurers a dead boar wrapped in silk hanging from the ceiling. A failure will not alert them that in the darkness 3 Giant Wolf Spiders crawl along the dark ceiling near the hanging boar. If any creature touches any of the webbing around the room, the spiders are alerted and know exactly where the creature is. The spiders will attack from the ceiling as they sneak or dash to the creature that they have sensed in the area. Adjusting the Encounter C Here are recommendations for adjusting this Combat encounter. These are not cumulative: • Very Weak Party: Remove 1 Giant Wolf Spider and give advantage on Nature check to keep from rprising the party. • Weak Party: Remove 1 Giant Wolf Spider and give disadvantage on the Nature check to have party surprised. • Strong Party: Add 1 Giant Wolf Spider and not surprise the party. 4 total • Very Strong Party: Add 1 Giant Wolf Spider (surprise the party) 4 total Treasure: As the group searches the area they can find the following by searching the chests and village huts. There are several chests that can easily be opened from damaging the locks (AC 6) for 10 hp. Encounter A Treasure: A total of 5 chests can be found with the following items: 2 light crossbows and (1d4) cases of bolts. 4 short swords 2 great axes 1 potion of healing 1 Explorer's Pack Water Logged (10 gp). Includes a backpack, a bedroll, a mess kit, a tinderbox, 10 torches, 10 days of rations, and a water skin. The pack also has 50 feel of hempen ropes wrapped to the side of it. 1 Priest's Pack Water Logged (19 gp). Includes a backpack, a blanket, 10 candles, a tinderbox, an alms box, 2 blocks of incense, a censer, vestments, 2 days of rations, and a water skin. 1 Set of Padded armor 1 Set of Hide armor 1 rusty shield with a symbol of Balinor 19 Encounter B Treasure: Exceptional weapons are here Uncommon and better quality common weapons. Exotic weapons and finesse weapons are here also, as the snakes were successful in hiding the more valuable stash from the pirates and the group found a few dead pirates with weapons and gold. Trident – Good condition found on the dead Sahuagin Captain. Long Sword – on a dead Sahuagin Pirate Spell book – from the dead Sahuagin wizard. 1st: detect magic, identify, mage armor, magic missile 2nd: detect thoughts, mirror image, misty step Quarter Staff Light Crossbow Case of Light Crossbow bolts Enounter C Treasure: 1 Diary of Oceanside Waterfeet – The Tabaxi elder. The diary is worn and old, the pages are almost destroyed by time and weather, but if carefully stored can be carried and returned to Jelutong. Have the adventurers roll a Strength DC 5 check, failure will allow the adventurer to open the book, but as they do a page falls out and crumbles into unrepairable pieces and any further investigation will destroy pages of the diary. It would be best to give the diary to Jelutong and let the study it. The adventurers find several weapons of their choice as found in the Players Handbook of starting equipment. There are huts for all classes and contain your basic common starting gear, without gold. The pirates have ram shacked and pillaged the village so most of your common items and no valuables are left. Barrels of Bolts along the targets can be found. The characters can place as many of these in a case that will fit into backpacks. Barrels of Arrows along the targets can be found and quivers are available for the characters. Unused Blank Spell book A book used to copy spells into for wizards. This book was unused and left behind by a wizard, intended to use as a backup for their spell book. The desk also has ink and quiver. The ink looks dried, but fresh water may make it useful, or find an octopus somewhere for ink. All of the equipment is very worn and a few years old. It can help in a battle but they will need to find new weapons as they adventure. Conclusion: The adventurers do not find any signs of the Tabaxi that once lived in the area. There are many bones and debris of a tragic past, but they do find enough items to allow them to continue safely to meet the other Tabaxi and inform them of the fate of the village. Upon a few more days camping inside the village, Jelutong rows up with her hunt and greets them. “Hello! We have good news and bad news…” You see Jelutong and her hunt exit a boat, She yells a command and the boat suddenly starts to fold into itself as the contents and oars all get folded together and form a chest. Habor then opens the chest and pulls out a map, showing the adventurers a map that looks to be the main Island. “We know where our people are kept, but they are enslaved by the Tritons who attacked your ship 20 and there are monstrous creatures keeping watch over the area.” Jelutong relays the following information. • The map of the island was found in the Temple. There were few Tabaxi found in the temple, mostly the women and children that have hidden in the temple after the attack. • The survivors are still at the temple and safe from the Pirates, unless they search the Island for the temple. At this time, there is no known reason to search for the temple. • The elders may have kept the temple a secret, but could have managed to release information that the women and children are in hiding. The pirates know that there are survivors and have been seen at the beach where we found the travelers from the distant land. Our allies have helped up keep them at a distance, but we fear they are building an army of monstrous creatures to invade and finish off the clan for good. • A detailed map of the Volcano, Destrucavous the Angry God was retrieved and can be given to the adventurers. The island has various places that can be setup with villages and they would be at the various entry ways into the Volcano. Be careful as there are many who have joined the pirates cause. • The captives have enslaved the weak- minded and those who have no more hope. They are finding rare and valuable minerals from the Volcano and some of the magical properties of the Island have been found useful to the many Arcane/Divine casters in the Pirate’s group. There is an interest in these materials and magic properties. Wondrous things have been reported. Jelutong asks that the adventurers help to free the prisoners and in return they will provide all of the help they can. They have set up a meeting place on the map. They suggest going separately into the island so that suspicion is not aroused during the trip across the ocean from the smaller Island. The Tabaxi know these islands well and have bases on every one of them. They will scout what is left of the Island clans and try to recruit others to help, as they are sure a similar fate has been forced upon them. Travel stealthy across to the small island to the east, then go north to the main island. We will travel to the other islands and gather forces. If you see any Tabaxi, give them this. She hands the travelers a scroll with the Jungle Mountain Clan, a Large Lion with Claws spread, jumping with Mountains in the background. The Tabaxi will welcome you and I have outlined the plan on the scroll. Please make haste, if the pirates are successful in gathering more Island magic they would be unstoppable. 21 Part 4: Search and Rescue The plan is to use stealth and find the Tabaxi or anyone that wants to help with the rescue mission as you make your way towards the main Island. The journey is quiet and long during the night and no creatures are alerted to your position. The sea remains rather calm as your boat glides to the small island. The moonlight allows ample dim light for you to keep your destination in view and as you approach the island, there are signs of life in the trees. Suddenly you hear a bump on your makeshift canoe as it hits a rock nearing the beach. The group jumps out of the boat and pulls it ashore at the nearest land mass. General Features Around the Beach, the water crashes lowly and the rocky shore establishes a great point to make a shoreline camp. Beach. The beach is rocky, unlike the other Island and has difficult terrain all along the ends of the island. Towards the middle of the Island is more rocky terrain but it is inhabited with dense jungle. Sounds. The sounds of wild life surround the adventurers as waves crash against the rocks of the beach. Typical beach sounds sooth everyone and make it possible to make stealth rolls with advantage. Smells. The smell of the salt water and fresh humid jungle fill the air. The rock is very porous and there are whiffs of sulfur in the area which can only indicate this island was the product of the volcano that is on the main island or another one near. Lighting. The night sky is lit by the full moon. The stars are numerous in the sky and the dimly lit island can be viewed as any other room illuminated by candle light. Jungle. The island seems like a smaller version of the one that everyone is familiar with. There is a dense jungle forest on the inside of the island and small mountains that could easily be climbed. It looks difficult to travel through but it is not intimidating. The Tabaxi Campsite Deep in the jungle, there is a Tabaxi Campsite. The adventurers must reach this campsite in order to get them to join or investigate to see if there are any on this island. They are given the trails to take from Jelutong and it does not take long for them to see a small village in the distance. There are slain sahuagin along the trail. The group must make an Intelligence DC 18 (Nature or Investigation) to notice there is something in the jungle following them. As the adventurers get closer to the camp grounds 5 Tabaxi Warriors and 1 Tabaxi Clan Leader ambush them. Surrounding them on the trail. The party can use a Charisma DC 10 (Persuasion) check and not attack the group of Tabaxi, showing them the letter that Jelutong has given to them. A failure save will not instantly gain acceptance from the hostile Tabaxi and they will 22 shackle the group and force them into the camp. The Tabaxi find the letter when they frisk the team and make note to the Elder of what they are carrying. Making the Save will allow them to stop and read the letter. The group is in the Tabaxi camp and joined by the Village Elder. They have a lot of questions, as they are Tabaxi. They have little use for vague answers and if the party cannot answer them with specifics and detailed accounts, they will become suspicious of the group. • What has brought you to these hidden islands? • Where did you come across this canoe, it looks to be Tabaxi and we do not know of any surviving Tabaxi clans in this area? • What do you know of Jelutong from the Mountain Jungle clans? • What do you want from us? • Explain this letter and when did you receive this? All questions must be in detail, if there is any vague or stuttering sentences a Charisma DC 15(Persuasion) must be made to convince them that you are not spies sent from the main island. The Tabaxi clan is still not satisfied with the groups answers, though if the group has saved any persuasion saves, they are not likely to imprison them, or kill them. If the clan is inclined to believe the group, they will offer a challenge to join the effort to save their friends. The Recruitment The untrusting Tabaxi make it apparent that leaving the village and fighting the pirates on the main island is not a beneficial plan for them. They have been under constant attack from the Sahuagin since the pirates arrived. The Molikahi Cliff Clan has lived here for a long time. Making Intelligence DC 10 (History) checks reveal the following about the Clan. • Their markings are those of a jaguar, very large and fast. These quiet and quick cats look to be dangerous, most of them have seen many battles in this jungle. • They split with the Jungle Mountain cats a long time ago, but have maintained constant communication with them and shared the same sacred abbey that is hidden in the Jungle Mountain islands. They no longer wanted to share the islands with the monstrous creature, as they presented a danger that they did not want to continually fight. • The Molikahi Cliff Clan are not as physical as the Jungle Mountain clan and one can easily see why they left the island for this one. This smaller island does not have a dangerous aura and the fauna is mostly exotic fruits and trees. • The Molikahi Cliff clan seem to fundamentally offer more knowledge than brawn as noted from Jelutong’s Hunt. This Hunt has more scientific approaches to life and has setup a very nice laboratory. The elder Jag Creek • is a large and well adorned Tabaxi with beautiful Jaguar spots. Jag Creek shares with the group stories about how the Sahuagin have invaded several times. The grow stronger each time they attempt to raid their village and the Tabaxi grow weaker. “The Jungle Mountain clan have the giants helping them fight the Sahuagin, but we only have 23 our wits. Which I fear is not enough.” Says Jag Creek. If you want us to assist you, you will have to make sure our village is safe from invasion follow this information and formulate a plan. • There is a port on the far side of the island where the Sahuagin have camped. This is where they sail into with raiding parties. • The Tabaxi have magic powder that causes tragic explosions. We have tried to battle them, but they over power our strongest forces. We can only get so far into the encampment before we are spotted. • The Sahuagin have replacement troops every 10 day. They arrive at noon from the main island with more weapons and provisions. They are broadening their camp so that they can house more troops for the raids. They have doubled in size which makes it almost impossible for us to fight against, even with our magic. • Take these barrels of powder into their camp, strike the fuse with a fire source and run. The barrels will destroy the huts and anyone inside. • The Tabaxi of the Molikahi Cliff have created a vast network of tunnels throughout the island. The can stealth to anywhere on the island and surprise even the cleverest invaders. The tunnels and cliff dwellings are a massive and very impressive to those who have not seen them before. The caves are a tight fit for large creatures, which seem to dominate the fauna of these islands. Once you have destroyed the Sahuagin, it will be safe for us to travel and leave our women and children behind. We have no doubt that if there is no more camp on either side, the Sahuagin will no longer attempt to raid our village. The Tabaxi scouts guide you to the Sahuagin camp. You see only one war canoe. There are 4 Sahuagin Pirates, 2 Sahuagin Captains and 2 Sea Spawn Pirates in the camp along with a War Canoe. There are sounds of hammering and drinking as the pirates are building more huts to house the troops. The Tabaxi scouts will stealth into position to help the party as the party determines how to raid the pirate camp. They need you to provide a diversion for them so they can set the charges and destroy the camp. The party can make a Charisma DC 10 (Persuasion) check to talk them into keeping the war canoe intact. Let the party devise a plan and act out a surprise attack against the Pirates. The scouts will join the party’s fight only if the odds are for the Sahuagin, but mainly rely on the party to take them out as they set the explosives. Adjusting the Encounter Here are recommendations for adjusting this combat encounter. These are not cumulative: • Very Weak Party: Remove 1 Sahaugin Captain and 1 Sea Spawn Pirate. • Weak Party: Remove 1 Sea Spawn Pirate • Strong Party: Remove 1 Sahuagin Captain • Very Strong Party: Add 2 Sahuagin Pirates Developments: If the Party is successful in defeating the Sahuagin, they find favor with the Molikahi Cliff clan and Jag Creek vows to help the Jungle Mountain cland. 24 The group now will travel with a scouting group and meet at the rendezvous spot with Jelutong. The Scouts identify that the groups of Pirates have watching parties on guard at most of the main beaches of the islands. There is an underwater cave near the rendezvous site that they have used before to infiltrate and their plan is to swim to the cave and meet with the others at the rendezvous. With their help the party is now prepared to meet any combat. 25 Part 5: Dangerous Liaisons The party is now ready to head to the rendezvous. Allow the adventurers to gather any equipment, armor or magic items necessary. The Molikahi Cliff village is a small but well established magic hub for the island. It has not been raided due to their diligence is being secretive and strengthened their defenses. Speaking with the Elder The adventurers discuss the plans to join the others on the main island. These are some of things the Elder Jag Creek will offer to the group. • We are a small village and the Pirates seem to have little interest in us, they concentrate more on finding the secrets that we keep on Mountain Jungle Island. • We have heard the are looking for the Tabaxi temple, for all of the wonders that we keep there. They will never find it and if they do they will not survive long against our defenses. • The Cliff islands only have the beach where you entered and the beach where the pirates entered, these are our travel routes to the other islands. Dangerous cliffs surround the entire island, the rocks are porous and sharp, which tends to result in instant death if one wrong foot hold is used. The rock is also fragile and attempts to climb the rocks make it impossible to use climbing pitons. • We can see the pirates as the leave the main island. It allows us to use our allies in the water and prepare our defense when they try to raid. Otherwise we seek refuge in the caves and tunnels as to not be detected. Our tunnels are quite small and usually undetected. They have tried to destroy some of the entrances, but we have many below the water. After the group gathers the information they need. The Elder Jag Creek will take them to the inner tunnels, if there are others that are large creatures, or party members that are claustrophobic, then the group will be taken to the beach that they had earlier landed. The Elder performs a ritual that will allow everyone to breath under water. They must follow the Kabaxi to the innermost tunnels of the main island as to not be detected by any troops that are above the water. That does not mean they also have patrols under water so stealth is key and the swimmers must stay hidden in the coral. Developments The swimmers make their way to the main island. There are patrols and danger around the caves that they intend to use so let the group devise a way to sneak underwater into the cave. Use the following chart for encounters as the group rolls Intelligence DC Checks (Nature) against the following: DC roll Encounter 1 Surprise Sahuagin Pirate Patrol 2-4 Surprised by Sea Spawn Patrol 5-9 4 Sharks attack 10-14 Giant Octopus Attack 15-19 Surprise a Sea Spawn Patrol 20 Uneventful 26 Surprised by Sahuagin Pirate Patrol The party rolls a critical fail and as a result the nearby Sahuagin Pirate Patrol are alerted at their presence.

The matter of taking back their islands can now begin and the Tabaxi are very happy with the group’s help in the matter and they provide the group with passage to anywhere they would like to go. They would like to have ore help to defeat their foes and inform the group to keep vigilant for them to contact them with more information. They are very recluse and take every precaution to keep their islands a secret. They draw a map to avoid the are in any future travels across the ocean, so that there are no unnecessary Pirate encounters again. The Tabaxi gives everyone directions on how to meet again. They rarely stay on the Islands, but until the pirates are defeated they must make sure their people are safe. The travelers will likely meet them again to fight the pirates and help liberate island. 28 Conclusion The adventurers were successful in surviving the Pirate attack and were able to make it to New Abeir with the help of the Tabaxi. Laryllia is now in Tarmalune along with the survivors of the voyage. She has reached out to her family to rebuild her ship and provide a Hippocampus II for the travels. The Tabaxi were able to provide a safe route for the travelers, so that any further pirate interaction would not include our new-found enemies. The nobles were able to find space in Tarmalune and were very grateful for getting them to the new land. They share with you a bond that would never be unbroken and anything they can repay you with they will. You can also be their guest in their houses any time you wish, as you are not only an ally but family. The Tabaxi bid you farewell and express that this will not be the last time that we meet. Your favor with the Mountain Jungle Clan and the Molikahi Cliff cats are great and you are welcome to their villages any time you want to brave the travel to their Islands. All of the travelers have a map to their Temples on Faerun and New Abeir and hope they will visit often, though they know it will be dangerous as long as the Pirates have control of the Volcano on the main Island. Jelutong shouts “We will ask for your help soon, go and find worthy adventurers to join our war against these foul Pirates” as they sail off back to their home lands. Laryllia shares with the group that she plans to find an army to help the Tabaxi and asks the Adventurers to also join the initiative to find recruits. Meet either in Waterdeep or Tarmalune anytime you are ready and we will set sail to the Tabaxi and help them fight the Pirates and free their Islands.

Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption. An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.

This caravel is a typical example of the type, although the inter-nal arrangement can vary greatly from ship to ship. Its notable features include: • Quarterdeck: The quarterdeck is a raised, open deck at the stern. The ship’s wheel is here, along with a small davit for a ship’s boat. • Foc’s’le Deck: This is a raised, open deck atop the fore-castle. The caravel mounts a ballista here; the weapon can’t fire straight ahead because of the foremast. On the starboard side is the hawsepipe and tackle for the ship’s anchor. • Master’s Cabin: The largest and most comfortable cabin on the ship is still quite cramped by most standards. • Wardroom: The captain, officers, and passengers take their meals here. This room also serves as a drawing room or parlor for the officers and passengers. • Main Deck: This open deck features a catapult and two large companionways that descend to the lower deck. The catapult can only be fired to the broadside; it can’t train forward or aft (a typical problem with large weapons mounted on small, cluttered ships). The companionways serve as both stairways (ladders, in nautical parlance) and cargo hatches. Chicken coops and pens for goats, lambs, or other small livestock often take up any available space left on the deck. • Forecastle: Most of the ship’s crew sleeps here, although in good weather many crewmembers prefer to sleep on 44 the open decks. The forecastle holds a dozen cramped bunks. • Galley: The ship’s galley is in the forward part of the lower deck. It has a small stove and shelving for all kinds of foodstuffs. The ship’s cook and his assistant(s) sleep here. • Chain Locker: The ship’s anchor chain is stored here. It passes through the hawsepipe in the forecastle up to the foc’s’le deck. • Lower Deck: This space serves as the first of the caravel’s cargo holds, as well as the crew’s mess deck. Crewmembers take their meals sitting on whatever cargo is convenient. If the ship is heavily laden, this deck might be covered to within a foot of the overhead, leaving only a single fore-and-aft passage between the crates, casks, and bundles. • Officer’s Cabins: These tiny cabins are the private rooms of the ship’s officers. Paying passengers usually bump an officer from his or her cabin to the forecastle. • Ship’s Office: All the ship’s paperwork is kept here, in-cluding cargo manifests, pay records, and the ship’s paychest (usually in a sturdy, locked chest). • Sail Locker: Spare sails, canvas, and sewing gear is stored here, as well as plenty of lines, hawsers, firewood, and heavy tools. • Lower Hold: Most of the ship’s cargo is stowed here, as well as provisions (including as many casks of fresh water as will fit). Beneath this lower hold lies a small crawlspace where heavy ballast stones help to stabilize the ship. 45 Player Handout 1 A letter from the Zhentarim Faction Leader: Initiate: Your presence and skills are needed aboard the Hippocampus.
