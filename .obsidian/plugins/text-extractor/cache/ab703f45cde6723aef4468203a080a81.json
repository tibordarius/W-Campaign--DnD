But a great captain is at ease, knowing that he has a ship’s mage onboard. Specially trained wizards, ship’s mages master spells which keep a vessel and its crew in ship- shape. This includes preventing and repairing damage to the vessel, calming dangerous weather, and providing arcane firepower in naval engagements. Wizards who specialize in abjuration, evocation, or transmutation are the most common recruits for ship’s mages. Good-aligned ship’s mages might serve aboard merchant ships or warships for good and just rulers, while evil-aligned mages offer their support to the navies of tyrants or aboard the ships of murderous pirates. Recluses at Sea. Ship’s mages often share their landlubber counterparts’ preference for solitude. Unfortunately, such solitude is a rare commodity in the tight confines of a ship, and many ship’s mages demand their own private cabin as part of their agreement to sail. In these cabins, they keep their spellbooks (locked away and warded against water damage), spell components, and charts that help them track their proximity to magical ley lines running along the ocean floor. Encounters Captain and First Mage A ship’s mage serves as the first mate on a pirate vessel, using divinations to help the captain track valuable prizes. 1 ship’s mage 1 pirate lord (see the NPC - Pirate Lord on DMs Guild) Castaway After an unfortunate mutiny, a ship’s mage is found adrift in a rowboat, being driven along by a summoned water elemental. 1 ship’s mage 1 water elemental Negotiations A dangerous sea voyage requires a ship’s mage, but the only one available for hire is being recruited by two rival sea captains. 1 ship’s mage 2 bandit captains     1 SpellsRepair Damage1st-level transmuationCasting Time:1 action Range:Touch Components:V, S, M (three iron nails) Duration:Instantaneous An object or construct you touch regains a number of hitpoints equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.This spell has no effect on creatures that aren’tconstructs.At Higher Levels.
