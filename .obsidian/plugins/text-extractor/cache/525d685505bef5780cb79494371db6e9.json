As a result, there are a few options for play: Each adventure can be used in a standalone way. Any time the adventurers are at sea, one of these adventures can be inserted into the set- ting being used. Alternatively, these episodes can be strung together into a larger, ongoing campaign. They have been written with this idea in mind, and the ongoing threat from the Far Realms creates the basic through-line to the larger campaign. Well-meaning DMs should also prepare their players: Because many of these adventures have a personal thrust to them (the betrayal of good friends, the splitting of one’s own personality, etc.), Dungeon Masters and players should communicate about how much each is com- fortable with. If, for example a player doesn’t want to temporarily lose the agency of their character, or if your players aren’t interested in PC vs. PC matchups, maybe the adventure needs to be tweaked. The episode numbers refer to the recom- mended order of play, if played as a whole campaign. But some may be moved out of or- der as needed. EPISODE 1: WHERE NO ADVENTURER HAS GONE BEFORE At the edge of the sea, something lurks, some- thing watches, something waits. It yearns to enter our reality, and its purpose is beyond our comprehension. ADVENTURE SUMMARY The characters and their ship are commis- sioned to investigate a strange pink ribbon that appears at the edge of the sea for an hour at dawn. When they enter the ribbon, the ship be- comes damaged, several crewmembers are in- jured and/or killed, and one of the party, and perhaps one or more other members of the crew, particularly shows some strange effects. Unbeknownst to the rest of the party, these characters have begun to be empowered and directed by a malevolent otherworldly force. When the damage is assessed, the party real- izes they cannot reach any known port before they start taking on too much water. But an is- land is nearby where they might stop to effect some repairs. But meanwhile the powers of the affected crewmembers are growing. Upon reaching the island, the party is met by a group of wary native people. When they start showing a willingness to help with the repairs and to lead them back to their settlement where they have clerics to help their wounded, the affected party members attack them. The danger of the PC (and NPC[s]) is then turned on the rest of the party. If they can sur- vive long enough, there’s a chance that one of the clerics from the nearby village can remove the curse on the affected characters, but the party may need to destroy one of their friends for the sake of the Material Plane. RUNNING THE ADVENTURE To run this adventure, you need the D&D fifth edition core rulebooks (Player’s Handbook, Dun- geon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual). T SECRET NOTES This adventure requires some secret notes be passed to at least one character (the ESP-er). You may find it beneficial to pass notes to multiple players, to keep the suspicion as real as possible. The non-ESP-er players might receive notes that mention a weird look they notice from the ESP-er that sets them on edge. 4 SEA TRAVELING Most of the monsters that appear in this adven- ture are from the Monster Manual (MM), along with new creatures and NPCs, and monsters from Volo’s Guide to Monsters (VGM), Mor- denkainen’s Tome of Foes (MTF), and Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons (FTD). When a creature’s name appears in bold type, that’s a visual cue pointing you to its stat block in Appendix A or its source book, as may be indicated by the ab- breviations above. Spells and equipment mentioned in the ad- venture are described in the Player’s Handbook. Magic items are described in the Dungeon Mas- ter’s Guide, unless the adventure’s text directs you to an item’s description in another book or in Appendix B. WHAT LIES BEYOND? In actuality, the ribbon is an imperfect portal to the Far Realm. On the nearby island Al- tharp, atop a dormant volcano, is a crushed draconic shard (FTD). Hundreds of years ago a powerful warlock named Philip Verdane was demanded by his patron, a being from the Far Realm, to do combat with an ancient amethyst dragon (FTD) named Vureemduraeros, or Dawn Brightstar. Verdane defeated Brightstar, who poured her psionic power into a pink am- ethyst stone. However, the warlock spent the next year cracking the stone every day as it re- juvenated at dawn, and casting a corrupting spell over it at the same time. Finally the gem became a twisted version of the dragon’s mis- sion, each dawn causing a tear between the Material Plane and the Far Realm. It is only be- cause the opening does not last long that it has avoided detection by those who would oblite- rate it. But this weakness has also been the sal- vation of the Material Plane, because only slow invasions have been possible. Small corrup- tions and minor incursions have taken place. Still, eldritch horrors now walk the Material Plane, seeking a way to make the gap wider. (See Appendix B for more information on the cracked pink amethyst.) ADVENTURE HOOKS Occasionally sailors will report sight of a bright pink ribbon that appears at the light of dawn, distinct from the sunrise itself. There are ru- mors even of a strange mountain, corrupted by malevolent evils, giving passage to our world from dark planes beyond. Some will even con- tend that there is a challenge given by the gods to anyone who finds this light and grasps it, that they will attain great boons and perhaps even divinity themselves. Any of the following hooks might draw the players into the adven- ture. Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text. PLACING THE ADVENTURE As mentioned, these voyages can find a home in any sea-based campaign. It’s recommended that the party have their own ship and a base of opera- tions. The town of Saltmarsh in the Greyhawk campaign setting is an excellent choice, but any lo- cation with a need for seafaring adventurers will do. The sea upon which the party travels will need to be large enough that there are many un- charted islands and other locations. This adven- ture in particular will find the ribbon somewhere far to the east. THE RIBBON/BARRIER/LIGHT Throughout this adventure, these terms will be used interchangeably to describe the event on the horizon at dawn. However, when communicating with the players, it’s advised not to use the term “barrier” unless otherwise indicated, as this gives too much away about its true nature. And certainly don’t call it a “portal.” WHERE NO ADVENTURER HAS GONE BEFORE 5 RESCUE MISSION The characters are commissioned to recover the wreckage of an old ship, the Valiant, that was last seen a hundred years ago approaching this ribbon. They are either given by their em- ployer or find along the way a moldy old cap- tain’s log from the ship—the name “Captain Jon Kerris” is visible. Most of the pages are wa- ter-damaged and unreadable, but one can glean some hard-to-understand passages that say something about invasion, power, and hor- rible gods and monsters. EXPLORE EVERYTHING! For the crew looking for something excep- tional, something really out of the ordinary, this ribbon poses an interesting challenge. There’s something beyond it. There has to be! Some employers might be willing to pay hand- somely for any clue to what secrets this ribbon hides. INVASION OF HORROR Settlements and ships close to the ribbon have started reporting horrific monsters and visions, and the stories go beyond the tales of sailors. Ships have gone missing, and a rot has spread down the island of Altharp from atop its dormant volcano. ACT I—ENTER THE BARRIER Whatever the hook, the adventurers will set sail for the east, heading towards dawn. REACHING THE RIBBON Clues from Captain Kerris’s log and/or the sto- ries of different sailors lead them in the right direction. The journey should take at least a week, if not several, from wherever the charac- ters start. At your discretion, they might expe- rience one or more random encounters along the way. It should be night when they finally near the location. Presumably one or more of the characters will be keeping watch, or an NPC crewmember will do so. If the latter is true, that NPC should wake the characters, at which point, read the following: Depending upon the mission the characters have undertaken, they may push straight through into the barrier. If they try to stop, however, it’s too late. The momentum of the ship carries it directly into the ribbon’s edge. Ask the players to make a Charisma saving throw. Without revealing successes or failures, take a note of whose score was the highest (and whose Charisma score is higher in case of a tie). Read the following: The ship’s hull takes 8d10 force damage, but however much damage it takes, there is a wide gash in the hold or belly of the ship more than 5 feet long. In the chaos immediately following the encounter with the barrier, this damage is not noticed, so it takes on water quickly. At your option, one of the NPC crewmem- bers of the ship will experience the same things A thin line of yellowish red dawn begins to rise on the horizon. In its light you can see the small shape of an island several leagues to the south. But as the distant sunlight intensifies, much closer and much brighter is an iridescent pink light that grows quickly until it rises like a wall more than a hundred feet high and stretches as far as you can see to the north and the south. The light ripples and bends like a ribbon. It feels as though it is right in front of the bow of the ship. The light overtakes you, crackling like lightning. You can’t see anything but pink light. The main sail suddenly catches fire, and something like a wave rocks the ship, splintering several of the boards and rails, and sends you spinning, hurt- ling away. 6 SEA TRAVELING as the character who rolled the highest Cha- risma saving throw. You may roll a d20, and choose that this happens to the NPC on a result of a natural 20. Pass the following note pri- vately to the character who rolled the highest Charisma saving throw: In the moments after this encounter, the other characters discover the affected PC (and NPC) unconscious and raise them up. But when they do so, they notice that a slight pink aura shines around the character. (Or their eyes are pure silver.) A DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana or Reli- gion) or Wisdom (Insight) reveals that some- thing from the barrier has infused itself into the character. A detect magic spell reveals that some magic from the school of enchantment or trans- mutation, but can’t get more specific. Nothing but a remove curse or greater restoration spell can undo the effects. Hereafter, the affected characters are called “ESP-ers.” ACT II—GEOMETRIC PROGRESSION The fire in the mast requires a DC 10 check to put out (see Ghosts of Saltmarsh for fire rules). But they also find that they have taken a good deal of damage. Besides the mast being unusa- ble in its current state, any character that is be- low decks may notice the water filling up the belly. The ship’s bosun can attempt repairs us- ing carpenter’s tools. On a 15 or higher, they gain 1d4 hours of sailable time. Likewise, the mending cantrip can be used each round, but the gash in the hold is too wide to completely fix. They’ll need to make port before the end of the day or sink. Meanwhile, the ESP-ers’ powers are growing. Even if the events aren’t followed exactly as outlined in this adventure, the powers will grow in the progression indicated on the “Powers Gained by the ESP-ers” table. POWERS GAINED BY THE ESP-ERS Act Powers II You have gained the ability to cast detect thoughts and dissonant whispers at will, re- quiring no material components and ex- pending no spell slots, and the save DC is 14. In addition, you can extend your will to a greater distance. Almost through sheer psychic power, your attacks can reach far- ther. Your melee attacks that aren’t spells have a range of 30 ft. and deal magical force damage. III You have gained the ability to cast the fol- lowing spells, requiring no material compo- nents and expending no spell slots, and the save DC is 14: - At will: shocking grasp - 3/day: phantasmal force You have also gained +2 to your Armor Class, as the aura around you provides some magical defense. IV You have gained the ability to cast the fol- lowing spells, requiring no material compo- nents and expending no spell slots, and the save DC is 14: - At will: hold person - 1/day: telekinesis You have also gained Damage Resistance to acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, poison, and thunder. If the players don’t think of it, one of the NPC crewmembers can call out (perhaps from the crow’s nest), “Land ho!” toward the island of Altharp to the south. The island is 2d6 miles away. The ship will start sinking in earnest in 1d6 hours. If the ship can’t make it to the island before the “sinking in earnest” time runs out, forward momentum stops. The crew will have to escape in jolly boats (if equipped) or swim away. Swimming to escape the eddies of the ship re- quires a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. At your option, you may allow the ship to rest on You feel an electric shock in your brain and fall unconscious. When you awake, you are weak- ened but have a new awareness: there is power beyond the barrier, power you need, and if you focus, soon you will be able to cross and get it. WHERE NO ADVENTURER HAS GONE BEFORE 7 a coral reef near the island rather than sinking to the bottom of the sea. Along the way, the ESP-ers are growing in power. Pass the ESP-er player the following note: Any NPC ESP-er you include gains the same abilities as the PC ESP-er. If you include such an NPC, you may choose to inform the ESP-er player that they have an ally. As suspicion grows, the other PCs may try to restrain the ESP-ers. If this occurs, allow the ESP-er player to react however they wish. An NPC ESP-er who is confronted will react with aggression. If they succeed in incapacitating the party, they will go to the island and head up the mountain toward the cracked pink ame- thyst. As they near the island, read the following: ACT III—SQUASH YOU LIKE INSECTS Eventually, the ship comes to a resting point and the characters can assess their situation. If the ship sinks to a reef, repairs will take 1d4 months. If the characters arrive at the island, repairs will take 1d4 days of such daily checks. Either way, for the repair day to count, the ship’s bo- sun has to spend 8 hours each day at the ship, making a check with carpenter’s tools, DC 15. If months are required, he can take 1 day off per week and still keep up with repairs. Once at the beach, a DC 10 Wisdom (Percep- tion) check reveals a number of figures skulk- ing in the forest, watching. Besides many wild animals, 4 duergar (MM), each with the feat “Gift of the Gem Dragon” (FTD), wait in the forest. They are not really trying to hide them- selves, but are looking with curiosity at the newcomers to their island. In fact, after a mo- ment, they will come out and ask if the ma- rooned party needs any help. A DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that they are sincere in their aim to help, but part of this is that they don’t want any visitors sticking around. However, these duergar will react differently to the ESP-ers: if they are visible to duergar passive Perception (10), they will warily A sandy brown mountain stands erect from the sea like an arrowhead toward the sky, hundreds of feet high. Veins of black stone wind down the mountain’s face. A thickly forested island blan- kets its feet. A thin dark beach rings the outside of the island. Thin billows of smoke rise from deeper in the forest, as if from campfires or chimneys. There’s something more going on here. Your compatriots are looking for a way to remove your power. Go with them to the island, but do not let them destroy you. Your new abilities will be your salvation. You have gained the ability to cast detect thoughts and dissonant whispers at will, requiring no material components and expending no spell slots, and the save DC is 14. In addition, you can extend your will to a greater distance. Almost through sheer psychic power, your attacks can reach farther. Your melee attacks that aren’t spells have a range of 30 ft. and deal magical force damage. ALTHARP DUERGAR The duergar of the island of Altharp are just like those in the Monster Manual, with the following exceptions: their alignment is lawful neutral, their Dexterity score is 10, and they have the feat “Gift of the Gem Dragon,” detailed in Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons. The dwarves native to this island were in ancient times devoted to Dawn Brightstar and her mission. But after Verdane destroyed her and corrupted her gem, their set- tlement grew corrupt by the same Far Realm magic. Although not totally evil, these dragon- blessed dwarves took on darker features and live underground in the forest of Altharp. The Altharp Duergar mine iron from beneath the mountain, which is a long-dormant volcano. There are hints of ancient art in their equipment, but most is dull and purely utilitarian. One ex- ception is a sprinkling of fine crystals that deco- rate the armor and weapons of the duergar. A distinct class of twenty trained warriors stand ready to fight, alongside forty miners, among the village population of roughly a thou- sand. 8 SEA TRAVELING approach, spreading out widely like a team of dogcatchers. One of their group will start run- ning back toward their village, while the other three begin looking for an opportunity to inca- pacitate the ESP-ers. Pass the following note to the ESP-er player: The fleeing duergar is at least 100 feet away and takes the dash action each turn, depending on how quickly hostilities begin. It should be very unlikely that anyone will capture him. Al- low the ESP-er player to roleplay the curse how they will. They may be able to convince their crew to fight with them against the duergar, in which case the fight will be over quickly. In the event that the party chooses to fight against the ESP-ers, there is a good possi- bility that the ESP-ers will be overpowered. The duergar will not choose to kill the ESP-ers if possible, and during the battle will call out to the party that help is on the way. Likely this will end with the ESP-ers bound, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated. If the ESP-ers and any allies defeat the duergar, however, the ESP-ers will be drawn toward the mountain. Roquet and the other duergar (see Act IV) will pursue after discover- ing the scene at the beach, in which case Act IV will take place closer to the mountain, perhaps even up in the caves. ACT IV—PRAY TO ME Give the ESP-er player the following note: If the ESP-ers have been incapacitated, it only takes a few moments before they are able to break out of it with ease. They burst the ropes that tie them, or they shake off the potion or enchantment that holds them, or whatever else is applicable. Allow the ESP-er player to make this decision as they wish. You may wish to in- clude this option for them in the note for this act. Once combat begins it will take 2d4 rounds before Roquet arrives. At that point, read the following: Scale this encounter how you see fit. If the ESP- er is already struggling against the PCs, maybe Roquet is accompanied by one other duergar. But if the PCs are on the verge of death, add one duergar per PC. Or any number in be- tween can be used. Roquet’s goal is to touch the ESP-ers and cast remove curse on them. If there are two ESP-ers, this will use all his level-2 spell slots. To ac- complish his goal, he is likely to cast command on the ESP-ers or to turn invisible until he can They will try to kill you if you don’t kill them first. The rest of your crew will join with them unless you prove your power to them. But they are mere insects before you, insects who dare to hide power from you atop the mountain. You have gained the ability to cast the follow- ing spells, requiring no material components and expending no spell slots, and the save DC is 14: - At will: shocking grasp - 3/day: phantasmal force You have also gained +2 to your Armor Class, as the aura around you provides some magical defense. Your crew is obviously no longer worth your time. They don’t understand. How could they? You are a god to them. There is only one final stage to cross. Destroy them here, climb the mountain, and recreate this island as you wish, a perfect paradise of your design. You have gained the ability to cast the follow- ing spells, requiring no material components and expending no spell slots, and the save DC is 14: - At will: hold person - 1/day: telekinesis You have also gained Damage Resistance to acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, poison, and thunder. A group of the same pale dwarves burst out of the forest and assess the situation. One is obvi- ously an important figure, with black stones braided into his beard and a grey circlet around his head. He shouts to you, “Hold them, if you can! I will end this!” And the dwarves rush for- ward. WHERE NO ADVENTURER HAS GONE BEFORE 9 make a touch attack against an ESP-er, after which he will cast the spell. Any duergar that accompany him will protect him until his goal is accomplished. The ESP-ers’ goal, meanwhile, is still to as- cend the mountain and find what they believe will be the source of their power. In reality, in a cave near the mountain’s peak, is the cracked pink amethyst. If Roquet succeeds in removing the curse from the ESP-er PC, the duergar will assist in making repairs to the ship, so that it takes one- quarter the time it otherwise would have (round up). However, they refuse to allow any- one to come into their village or to climb the mountain. Their reasoning is that it is all sa- cred, and it is their sworn duty, inherited from this realm’s protectors hundreds of years ago, to protect this plane from unnamable horrors beyond. AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS If your campaign uses experience points, this adventure poses an interesting challenge, since most of the combat is assumed to be among the PCs, besides any random encounters. One way to award experience points is to divide among the whole party 200 experience points per duergar either side combated. If other crew- members assisted, this can offset the experi- ence (or add to it, depending on how it plays out). UP THE MOUNTAIN? If the party wishes to force their way to the mountain, or sneak by, the Altharp duergar will fight to the death to defend their sacred places. Still, the party might succeed. The Brightstar Mountain is full of dangers. You may wish to make use of a random en- counters table for the mountain passage. But about 1,000 feet up is a cave entrance. IN THE CAVE The caves are all carved out of soft brown stone and black molten rock, and the ceilings are about 10 feet high unless otherwise noted. There are no light sources. A corrupting influ- ence courses throughout the cave, visible as a midnight-blue fluid that drips from the walls (at your option it may extend to some degree down the mountain as well). Every 5d6 minutes, a creature must make a DC 13 Consti- tution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic dam- age and be poisoned. The creature can repeat this saving throw after 1 minute to end the ef- fect on itself. Additionally, when the Constitu- tion saving throw is rolled, the creature must also make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or experience short-term madness for 1 minute. Consult the Short-Term Madness table (see “Madness Effects” in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) to determine the form of the madness. The locations are identified on the map on page 11. 1. ENTRANCE There are four visible passages from this circu- lar chamber: north, south, east, and west. The north and south passages are simple and straightforward. To the east, the passage slopes gradually downward, and every 5 feet stands a A thin layer of mud coats the floor, and various mushrooms grow in the corners of this circular chamber. To the north, south, and east are pas- sages, each also covered in mud. But it’s dark, and you can’t see anything beyond a few feet into those passages. 10 SEA TRAVELING violet fungus (MM) ready to attack. The stair- case at the end of the north passage leads down and then curves eastward to a depth of 30 feet before reaching the doorway into area 4. 2. VAULT The slime in the northwest corner is a black pudding (MM), which attacks any creature that enters the room. Treasure. Inside the chest are 8 pink ame- thysts, each worth 50 gp. 3. CHAPEL The door to enter this chamber is of the same stone that makes up the walls and ceilings. Note again that as in other chambers, there is no light source here. As a result, the following description should be given only if the party brings light or has a member with darkvision. If the only vision given comes through darkvision, remember that no color is visible. While the bowl with snakes has red liquid and the bowl with birds has blue, the characters will not know this unless they illuminate the chamber. Characters who investigate the bowls dis- cover that each is sitting atop a small hole, each a foot in diameter. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check shows that the bowls are not placed perfectly. Each one is tilted and wobbly over the holes, as though they aren’t meant to rest there. Any character who investigates the altar finds the following inscription written into the stone in Deep Speech: The solution to the riddle is as follows: a char- acter must drink the contents of the birds’ bowl (blue liquid), then put a drop of blood into the snakes’ bowl (red liquid), and finally pour the mixture down the hole on the right side (south side). The characters will not notice whether they have succeeded or not until they arrive in area 4, and the details are given there. A character who takes a drink from the blue liquid will take 1d4 necrotic damage. The char- acter’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduc- tion lasts until the character finishes a long rest. The character dies if this effect reduces their hit point maximum to 0. A character who takes a drink from the red liquid will suffer 2d8 necrotic damage, and that character’s Constitution and Wisdom scores are each reduced by 1d4. The character dies if this reduces their Constitution score to 0. The character falls unconscious if this reduces their Wisdom score to 0. HINT CHECKS Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint: Intelligence (History or Arcana) DC 10. Deep Speech is sometimes written right to left and Every few seconds, a fiery spark bursts near the north wall of this octagonal room. A winged idol there looms over a stone altar. The idol has a peeled, fleshy face with what might be half a dozen tongues or snakes protruding out from it. Each wing drips slowly with liquid, each of which sparks like flame on the altar below. Along the east wall is a low stone bench with two bowls sitting atop it, each full of liquid. The bowl to the right is made of iron and the outside is swarming with five open-mouthed snakes. The bowl to the left is made of stone, with four birds facing inward, beaks touching the top of the liquid.

Wisdom (Perception) DC 15. The liquids are different colors, but you can’t tell what the colors are without light. Additionally, the liq- uid in the birds’ bowl smells faintly of salt- water. Intelligence (Nature) DC 10. The word “brood” can apply to a newly hatched group of either birds or snakes, but most commonly to snakes. Wisdom (Medicine or Survival) DC 15. The liquid in the birds’ bowl is moderately toxic, but there is good chance of survival if in- gested. The liquid in the snakes’ bowl is deadly. THE CAVES IN ALTHARP MOUNTAIN = 5 ft. 12 SEA TRAVELING 4. GEM ROOM Heavy iron double-doors are shut at the en- trance to this chamber. A DC 15 Strength (Ath- letics) check is required to push them open. If the characters successfully completed the puzzle in area 3, the two star spawn manglers (MTF) in the room are asleep behind the rocks in the southeast corner. They will wake up in 1d4 hours or if they take any damage. If this is the case, also read the following: However, if they did not complete the puzzle correctly, the star spawn manglers lie in wait and will ambush the characters at the first op- portunity. A Wisdom (Perception) check of 17 or higher reveals their location. The holes near the entrance are large enough for a large or smaller creature to fit through. The sides are smooth and require a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb, unless the creature has a climb speed. A creature who be- gins falling down the hole must make this check in order to stop falling even if it has a climb speed. A creature who fails this check falls indefinitely into the belly of the mountain and the magma thousands of feet below. The window on the eastern wall is about 15 feet high, and only half a foot in diameter. The gem in the ceiling is the cracked pink ame- thyst. It is also trapped set to go off when touched. The only way a rope could be affixed to the ceiling is if it managed to touch the gem itself. But this would set off the trap as well. CHAMBER OF SLEEP AND DEATH Complex trap (level 11-16, deadly threat) Trigger. This trap activates when the cracked pink amethyst in the ceiling is touched. A wave of force ripples out from the gem, and a me- chanical clunk is heard from the floor as thin vents are revealed under the dust. Initiative. The trap acts on initiative count 20. Active Elements. The trap fills the chamber with poison and closes the door. Closed Doors. The doors on the west wall slam shut and are locked in place by magic. This effect activates only once, the first time the trap is triggered. Poison Gas. Poison gas floods the room, fill- ing the 10-foot-by-20-foot area beneath the gem, rising 10 feet high, and extends out- ward 10 feet every round. Each creature that starts its turn inside the cloud of gas must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save and falling asleep, or half as much damage on a successful one. This gas is corrosive and also affects creatures that don’t need to breathe. If the star spawn manglers are asleep, they will awake when they first have to make this saving throw, although they might fall asleep right away again. Countermeasures. There are a few ways that the trap can be overcome. Open the Doors. Opening the doors is the quickest way to circumvent the trap, but they are warded with magic. To open the doors, a character must first succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find the locking mechanism. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check is then required to disable the sphere of force that sur- rounds the lock (dispel magic is ineffective against it). Success on a DC 20 Dexterity Dim light pierces the gloom of this long, trape- zoidal room from a tiny window on the eastern wall. It refracts off a pink gem embedded in the ceiling, 20 feet up, which has noticeable cracks all over its surface. Rubble and stones are piled around the southeast corner of the room. Bones litter the floor near the entryway—most are from animals, some could be humanoid. There are two massive holes in the ground and a large copper bowl near the bones. There is also a hole in the ceiling above that in the floor to the left, and another in the ceiling above the bowl. A thin purplish vapor that smells vaguely of wet rust and saltwater dissipates from around the bowl. WHERE NO ADVENTURER HAS GONE BEFORE 13 check using thieves’ tools picks the lock. Fi- nally, a successful DC 15 Strength (Athlet- ics) check is needed to pull the door open. Each check requires an action. Close the Vents. The vents can be covered to stop the flow of gas. A successful DC 15 Strength check can be made to block up the vents with a cloak or similar object. How- ever, sufficient material must be available to cover 10 feet by 20 feet, or eight 5-foot- by-5-foot squares. Someone must remain holding the blocking objects until the whole area of vents are closed. When they are all covered, the trap deactivates. Avoid by the Pits. The gas is heavier than air, so stays near the floor. While it billows up to the ceiling near the gem, it will never reach the ceiling above the doorway or any- where past the holes in the floor. Instead, once it reaches this point, the gas will start spilling downward. A creature who re- mains at least 10 feet high near the entrance has a chance to outlast the trap, which will continue emitting gas for 1d6 rounds after it first reaches the holes 14 SEA TRAVELING APPENDIX A: MONSTERS AND NPCS This appendix details creatures and nonplayer characters that are mentioned in this adventure and that don’t appear in the Monster Manual. That book’s introduction explains how to inter- pret a stat block. The star spawn mangler appears in Mor- denkainen’s Tome of Foes, but is reproduced here for your convenience. ROQUET The religious and cultural leader of the Altharp duergar, Roquet is a sturdy pale dwarf with a grey circlet indicating his rank, and black magma stones decorating his beard. STAR SPAWN MANGLER Beings from outside our reality, left to guard the cracked pink amethyst atop the mountain. WHERE NO ADVENTURER HAS GONE BEFORE 15 16 SEA TRAVELING APPENDIX B: MAGIC ITEM CRACKED PINK AMETHYST Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) The amethyst appears to be a cracked pink gem about 6 inches in diameter. While you are holding the gem, or wearing it if set into a necklace, you gain the following benefits: • Each of your attacks deal an extra 1d8 force damage on a hit. • You gain resistance to psychic damage. • You are immune to disease. • Your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and you can use an action to begin flying with a speed of 30 ft. for 1 hour. This ability recharges after you take a short or long rest. • As an action, you can target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution sav- ing throw or take 16 (3d10) necrotic damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This ability recharges af- ter you take a short or long rest. Curse. The amethyst has been corrupted by malevolent magic. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a remove curse spell or similar magic. As long as you remain cursed, you cannot discard the gem, which immedi- ately teleports back into your pocket or pack. It carries the following detrimental properties: • The spirit of the ancient amethyst dragon Vureemduraeros still resides in the ame- thyst, but she is hostile and mad. Each time you use an action to use one of the ame- thyst’s properties, there is a 50 percent chance that she tries to take control of your body. If you fail a DC 23 Charisma saving throw, she succeeds, and you become an NPC under the DM’s control until her spirit is banished using magic such as the dispel evil and good spell. • While attuned to the gem, you have vulner- ability to all forms of damage other than ne- crotic, psychic, and poison. Although Vureemduraeros still dwells within the shard, the dark magic that corrupted her prevents her from rejuvenating as normal. Only a true resurrection or wish spell can restore her to the normal form of a draconic shard (FTD).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
