How many adventuring parties have first got to know each other sitting around a table drinking imaginary beer? Innumerable campaigns have begun in dusty, ale-soaked tap rooms, and the bartender is a staple of any good DM’s roleplaying arsenal. Tavern Tables is a quick and easy resource for DMs who find themselves with a sudden need for a tavern. Inside this document you will find a map and details of a new tavern, The Spitting Turtle, rules for a new tavern game, and a random roll table containing a multitude of NPCs that your party might encounter in the watering hole of their choice.

The spitting turtle A drop-anywhere tavern “You’ll get no food or board at the Turtle, but the ale is second to none. Don’t cross old Grundleson, though. He might look daft on them stills, but he’s one gnome nobody dares laugh at for long.” The Spitting Turtle The Spitting Turtle is a large estab- lishment located in what was once a market hall. The cavernous roof is a good 30’ above the floor, supported by a number of thick wooden pillars braced with dull steel. A 15’ high mezzanine level at the rear of the tavern overhangs a number of private booths against the back wall. The large central bar is the hub of the tavern. On busy nights there might be six or seven bartenders working the pumps, though during the day there are only likely to be one or two bartenders working. The hatch to the cellar is located in the middle of the floor behind the bar. Periodically a small bell can be heard ringing from below, followed by the staff working the bar stamping their feet to signal to those in the cel- lar that it is safe to open the trapdoor and climb the ladder. This trapdoor also doubles as the ale drop, and the floor between the bar and the main doors of the tavern shows clear signs of wear from years of draymen drag- ging casks across it. The Landlord The landlord of the Turtle is Genthar Grundleson, an aging, irate gnome who walks on a pair of large stilts that appear to be bolted into the bones of his thighs. In the stilts he still only stands a tough over 5’ tall, but the sight is something to behold. Genthar suffers no fools, and is par- ticularly eagle-eyed when it comes to patrons trying to take advantage of his staff - be it to wrangle cheaper drinks, or for other ends. Genthar is notoriously blunt and outspoken, always saying what he means and meaning what he says. He can be a good source of information about local happenings, but he is as likely to give answers as he is to tell people about the group of newcomers going around town asking questions Rumours The Spitting Turtle is a popular water- ing hole, and it is always filled with a variety of people with a variety of problems. Some examples of these include: 1. Genthar has been in a particularly fowl mood recently. Patrons mutter 1 that the places where his stilts join to his legs have begun to rust, and that this is causing him great pain. He would probably look favourably on someone who could repair - and protect - the metal and put an end to his suffering. 2. If the Turtle seems to be running low on the variety of ales it stocks recently, that is probably because one of the local breweries have re- fused to deliver to the tavern since one of their draymen took a nasty fall down the hatch behind the bar. 3. Staff from a nearby rival tavern have been coming to the Turtle and causing trouble, with the intend of driving customers away. This has been going on for the past few weeks, and is rapidly escalating. Last time they came round they attempted to sneak into the Tur- tle’s cellar, where they intended to poison the ale. The Spitting Turtle One square = Five feet Mezzanine Level Main Bar/Ground Level Cellar 2 Tavern Tables How to roll 1d50: Since you probably don’t have a pentacontahedron to hand (or 1d50, if you prefer), you can instead roll 1d100. Treat any re- sult from 1 to 50 as the number you rolled; for any result of 51 or higher, simply subtract 50 from your roll and take that as your result. 1d50 | What’s Going on? 1| Three human warriors look up wearily from plates covered in what appears to be odd- smelling pickles of dubious quality. 2| Three well dressed halflings and a human in rags are dividing up a pile of electrum pieces while enjoying some ale and quiches. One of the halflings is wearing an eye- patch. 3| A minotaur with one horn and a pixie wearing tiny plate armor are sitting beside each other and sharing a bottle of wine. It looks like they’re discussing old times and lost friends. 4| A shifty-looking tiefling in very fine clothes is sitting at the table with a local town girl on each arm and a half empty bottle of fine wine in front of him. Behind him stands an angry looking young man who might be hiding a dagger. 5| Two bards are at the table arguing. One is a red robed tiefling with a gold-painted viola and the other is a human in shabby clothes with a battered lute. They appear to be preparing to engage in a musical duel. 6| A miserable gnome in shabby motley is trying to repair his broken lute as another patron looks on and jeers about how the lute sounds better now. 7| A seething half orc is sitting alone with an empty pitcher of dwarven ale and a bro- ken pewter tankard. His fist is bloody from hitting the table, but he has tears on his face and is holding a lock of hair in his other hand. Mournfully, he mouths the name “Delano”. 8| A beautiful elven maiden cackles loudly as she walks away from the table, the wine she was drinking still coming out of her nose. Behind her is a miserable looking dwarf, still on one knee, sadly holding up a gold ring. 9| Festooned in ribbons and bells, a lithe young half-elf in bright colored tights leans over a portly middle aged merchant. The fit young fellow is bragging about his skills as a caravan guard, but the merchant seems dubious. 10| A voluptuous goliath woman is clutching a gnome to her chest and tearfully begging him to leave the adventuring life to stay with her. You can’t tell if he’s acquiescing to her request or suffocating. His five hafling compatriots are afraid to intervene. 11| Eight rough looking men in identical ragged tunics huddle over bowls of gruel, eyes darting around angrily. They are all chained together and a tough-looking dragon- born in plate armor sternly oversees them while brandishing a longsword. 12| A frustrated half-elf is standing at the head of a full table, and those seated at it are looking at him dubiously. Empty platters that once held hors d’oeuvre are scattered 3 before them, ignored as they grimly look over paperwork. He keeps saying, “It’s not a pyramid scheme!” 13| A white-faced human holding a bloody stump frantically looks at an indifferent cler- ic across the table from him. He seems frantic, and keeps repeating something about a “bear owl”. 14| A well-dressed, charming young man scoops up the pile of coins from the centre of the table with a wicked grin as four annoyed sailors throw in their losing hands and start leveling accusations of cheating. 15| A woman wearing barely more than tattered rags, her powerfully muscled body hor- ribly sunburnt and bare feet bloody and blistered, sits at the table alone with seven empty glasses in front of her. With a hoarse voice she bellows , “Bring another water, damn you!” 16| A worried young man barely out of his teens sits alone with an untouched drink. Scattered around him are a small coin purse, a dagger, a length of rope, and a piece of parchment that is lying open in front of him. He keeps glancing at the tavern door nervously, trying hard to be nonchalant. 17| There’s an empty table with a half full tankard sitting on it which the tavern staff seem to ignore. Occasionally there’s a squeak from the wood of the empty bench be- side it. After a while you notice that the tankard is now empty. 18| Two dwarves, an elf, a half-orc and a human all stand up from their chairs and pour a bit of their ale onto the ground. With deep sorrow in his voice the elf chokes out, “Here’s to you, Fancy Dan”. They all gravely take a drink in unison. 19| A small child sits at a table, feet dangling six inches above the floor. He is surround- ed by empty pewter mugs, and two comatose thugs lie under the table. He drank them there, and seems pretty composed. 20| An exquisitely-dressed young man stares into a pitcher of wine. He sniffs it, grimac- es and tries to steel himself to take a swig. Watching someone with sorrows they are unable to drown due to wine snobbery is a bittersweet feeling. 21| Two uncomfortable looking town guard awkwardly peer under the table. Beneath it is an overweight goblin, covered in reeking filth and arranging boxes like furniture. He’s demanding they leave; this is his house now! 22| A goliath and gnome are on a date. The goliath only seems interested in loudly talk- ing about bands he’s seen. The date is clearly not going well. 23| The corner table seems empty at first, but get close enough and you’ll see a small group of heavily armoured mice sitting on upturned mugs playing a game of dice. The tavern cat sits nearby, nursing a deep gash in its paw. 24| Three very agitated-looking dwarves in scale mail armour enter the establishment. They survey the room before one of them locks eyes with a member of your party. He taps the others and they glare menacingly. They sit, placing their axes down, not taking their eyes off you. 25| A quiet, solemn man of undetermined age sits alone staring at a chessboard with a look of deep concentration etched on his stern face. 26| A dirty svirfneblin is meticulously arranging his collection of tiny glass pigs. Any- time anyone gets close to his table, he covers the pigs with his damp hands. He has not ordered anything to eat or drink, nor does he intend to. 27| A trio of brawny men are spitting a baby pond turtle into each others mouths with incredible accuracy. The objective of their game isn’t entirely clear, but bets are 4 being placed. 28| This taproom is oddly subdued and quiet, and you notice that all of the chairs and tables have felt pads attached to the base of their legs. The bartender tells you - in hushed tones - that the lady of the house is sleeping upstairs, and that she is not to be woken. 29| At this table you see 4 average civilians enjoying their ales and engaging in light conversation. Undoubtedly the most suspicious thing you’ve seen all night! 30| A bard jumps onto a tabletop, yelling, “No tips, huh?!” She drop-kicks one tav- ern-goer’s roast chicken, smashes her lute over another’s head, then vanishes in a puff of smoke. 31| A calm and poised orc stares through his small, cracked glasses as he labours over a journal. He keeps catching glances from the other patrons because he’s the only person who’s entered without a weapon or armor. 32| A tiefling appears in an open doorway off to the side of the kitchen, aromatic woodsmoke pouring out from behind him. His arms are laden with seemingly-end- less links of sausages, and he calls out happily, “I liberated a few links, boys!” 33| An odd tiefling sits alone at a table. People are starting at him not for the usual reasons, but because his horns have been filed down and his eyes are completely yellow, pupils and all. 34| A drunk dwarf stumbles through the tavern door, carrying two stuffed goblins com- plete with armour and terrified expressions. He hiccoughs as he addresses the bar- keep. “How many pints for the pair of ‘em?” 35| A gnome with a wand directs globes of ale towards his grinning, open-mouthed companions. Sometimes he’s successful... 36| A large tortoise moves from table to table with a cask of ale strapped to his back. Patrons refill their mugs as he passes, dropping coins into a metal tin slung around his neck. Surprisingly, nobody attempts to take a drink without paying for it. 37| One table toward the back of the tavern has tall wooden screens pulled close around it. Thick, purplish smoke rises up from behind it, and occasionally you hear a deep, rumbling burp. 38| A young woman sits at the bar with an odd six-stringed lute. She is playing the same few bars of a song over and over, growing more frustrated with herself as she tries to get it right. Every time she starts again one of the bartenders winces visibly. 39| A group of trolls dressed in the latest street fashion are performing in an open space in the center of the tavern. Their music is mostly percussive, and sees them punch- ing rocks, slamming chairs on the ground, and kicking a barrel back and forth be- tween them. A large banner on the wall reads “STAMP! The Musical”. 40| A stout human man lies slumped over a barrel in the middle of the room, as the bar’s staff stand around him looking like they are waiting for someone. It appears he collapsed while making a delivery, and nobody knows how to help him. 41| A rhythmic thumping sound can be heard from beneath the floor of the tavern. A burly guard stands by the door to the cellar, where a small queue has formed. He seems to be checking a list before deciding whether to allow people to go downstairs. 42| A group of halfling women are crowded around a table that is far too small to com- fortably seat all of them. They each have mugs of coffee in front of them, and most of them have babies with them. Some of them are knitting, while the rest seem to be happily chatting to one another. 5 43| A group of children sit at a table in the back corner of the tavern. They have tank- ards of apple juice in front of them, and one is wearing a colourful paper crown. 44| A slender elven woman in red leather armour stands atop a table brandishing a rapier. She appears to be telling the story of an epic battle, acting it out with wild swings of her sword. She has already spilled a number of drinks, and appears to have given a nearby man an accidental haircut. 45| A cleric sits alone, patiently and expectantly. All around him are place settings with prayer books of his deity arranged neatly in front of them. He’s been sitting there for over an hour. 46| One table is surrounded by scarecrows in chairs, who have been posed as though in the middle of a game of cards. They don’t appear to be moving. 47| A man is attempting to punch through pieces of wood, with little success. Those surrounding him are eagerly exchanging money as he keeps insisting that this time he’ll get it. 48| The bar staff don’t actually seem interested in doing their jobs. They are gathered around one end of the bar, rudely dismissing any customers who get near them while having a loud conversation about a plan to make money by growing hedges. A piece of parchment is pinned to the bar in front of them, covered in diagrams that don’t appear to make any sense. 49| A group of adventurers sits at a table, trying to figure out how long they’ve been in this tavern. They speak as though they have tried - and failed - to leave several times. 50| A group of teenagers sits at a table in a far corner of the room. They are each dressed in over-the-top adventuring gear that seems to have been made out of scraps of wood and painted paper. They each have sheets of parchment in front of them and multiple odd-shaped dice. The teen at the head of the table stands behind a folded paper screen, seemingly telling the others a story. 6 Spit-turtle “You see them idiots playin’ turtle last night? One near enough choked to death, and all for a handful of coppers. Turtle tasted like crap after, too, but fear’ll do that to meat.” The Rules of Spit-Turtle Spit-turtle is a gambling game played in The Spitting Turtle. The game is played over three rounds, with the player who earns the most points be- ing crowned the victor. Playing Spit-turtle requires a target of three concentric rings painted on the floor in a 2’ square, and a line marked on the floor (called the “spit spot”) 5’ away from the target. Turns alternate between players, who must place a turtle in their mouth, stand at the spit spot, and launch the turtle toward the target. Spitters score 1 point if the turtle lands in the outer ring, 2 points for the second ring, and 5 points for the middle ring. In addition, the score for that spit is doubled if the turtle lands on its feet and is still alive. Players score 0 points for that spit if the tur- tle’s shell breaks on impact. Alternate Rules Instead of being played with a target and for points, Spit-turtle can instead be played by multiple players who use each others’ mouths as targets. Rumour has it that the scoring sys- tem is incredibly complex, and the actual rules for victory - and gam- bling - on this version of the game are nebulous and best explained by those engaged in play (assuming they can talk around a mouth full of turtle).
