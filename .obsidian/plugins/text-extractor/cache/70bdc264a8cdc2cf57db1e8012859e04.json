Adventure Background Dante Coldharbour, undead scourge of the sword coast, has taken to the sea in his ship \"The Maiden's Neck\" once again. Awakened from his long slumber by an accidental run in with Zhentarim slave traders who most graciously offered their blood, Captain Coldharbour has mercilessly slaughtered any foe who has come against him. Every crew he murders adds to his undead fleet and brings him one step closer to his ultimate goal, an army of vampires strong enough to Fly in from the sea and take the mighty city of Waterdeep once and for all. Many vessels have been noticed missing and so the Lord's alliance sent a crew of paladins and priests on a warship known as the \"Piercing Light\" to look into these disappearances and eliminate the culprit behind them. The crew inevitably discovered the vampire menace at large and expanded their search for the legendary vampire hunter Trejonn De Laperre to help neutralize the impending threat. -3- My hope is that this adventure is a building block for the DM's imagination to run wild with possibilities. I provide enough structure to progress the game and provide some intriguing content, but I also envision many DM's like myself, love to innovate and create something new! Hook The party begins their story awakening in a cage. They have no recollection of where they are, nor how they ended up in their current predicament. The last thing any of them remember is spending the night at a small inn on the way into the city of Wa terdeep. You awaken groggy and out of sorts, you notice the large iron cage that holds you is sitting in an oblong wooden room, most likely the hold of a traveling frigate. The air is damp and rats scurry about making squeaking sounds as they go. The only other items in the room are some barrels and creates stacked neatly at the opposite end of the room. The cage door requires a strength DC of 21 or a sleight of ha nd DC of 18 to unlock it. The barrels upon inspection are filled with rum, while the crates are filled with grain and corn. Other Potential Triggers The DM ca n b e crea tive here. They ca n ha ve a crew ma te come a nd check on them, or a wa ve hits the side of the b oa t ca using the ca ge to cra sh open. One wa y or a nother the pla yers will need to esca pe the ca ge. Feel free to innova te to ma ke the esca pe more interesting. Cage Stairs to upper deck Slaver Frigate Lower Deck -4- Zhentarim Slave Ship As players approach the steps climbing up to the upper deck, they will begin to hear screams and notice the ship is beginning to sway as if in a storm. Upon placing your hand on the hatch to ascend to the upper deck, the boat lurches and a mixture of sea water and blood flow down the hatch, washing over you and you are immediately overcome with the stench of death. The deck is covered with the bodies of the ship's crew, and standing among the carnage, eyes blazing red is a va mpire thra ll staring directly at the party grinning. A storm is raging around the ship and the party can barely make out their surroundings through the darkness and rain. The occasional lightning flash will reveal that there is a march larger vessel just twenty feet away on their ships starboard side. The party can escape the ship in multiple ways and be creative. If they choose to fight the thrall, they will be a bit over their heads, but nonetheless it attacks them when they take any action. With an investiga tion check DC 13, they can discover a life boat to escape in. Regardless of how the party decides to escape the doomed vessel, have the storm overwhelm them to where they end up floating on driftwood the following morning. Vampire Thrall Hatch to Lower Deck Helm Slaver Frigate Upper Deck -5- Piercing Light The players will be awakened floating of driftwood. The DM can determine if they are together or separated. I've also included a table for sea encounters if the DM decides to throw some enemies at the exhausted party. You awaken as the suns rays beat down upon your sea soaked faces. You grasp for life onto one of the several shabby pieces of wood floating about, most likely from the vessel that had once held you captive. A successful perception DC of 15 will be able to figure out that they must have drifted south from where they were initially attacked. After the players float for awhile or after a sea encounter, a large ship will appear in the distance. The Piercing Light sails up to the floating wreckage and pulls the party onboard. A successful perception DC of 15 will be able to figure out that they must have drifted south from where they were initially attacked. Cresting the waves, a few hundred feet away from you, you see a golden ship. The ship has elvish carvings running down the port and starboard sides and has a figure of an angel mounted on its bow. the ship's sails look almost to be made of golden canvas as they reflect the sun beautifully. Aboard the ship you see men, dwarves, and elves scurrying about as they notice you floating in the open water. Sea Creature Encounter Table D100 Crea ture 1-25 Reef Shark (x2) Giant Octopus25-50 Killer Whale50-75 75-100 Giant Shark -6- Aboard the ship they will meet Celeste Dua loin, a dwarven paladin who is leading the Piercing Light on their expedition. Celeste explains that they are searching for a ship crewed by vampire pirates and wants to know if the party has seen anything. She also offers for them to join her crew and aid them in their hunt. If the players accept her offer to join up with them, she will want to test their mettle by having them fight a Vampire Thrall who only has half its HP. If the party survives the encounter, Celeste will commission them with a small ship (the players can name the ship whatever they please) and ask that they seek out Trejonn De La perre, the famous vampire hunter. Once they find him and learn his secrets, they are to rendezvous back with the Piercing Light as Celeste will be continuing the search for the vampire pirates. Open Seas This is the point in the adventure where everything opens up. The party now has access to a small vessel and the whole sea is before them! The DM can decide on how the players will find Trejonn. One quick option is to have Celeste give the players a map that will guide them south in the general direction. Another option would be docking at an island village and asking around the tavern for information on the hunter. The discovery of the isla nd through skill checks will require a DC of 18 or a b ove. The players may also want to explore other islands along the way, but all of this is up to the DM's preference. Once the party has located the island where Trejonn resides (through whatever means necessary) they can embark on the journey which should take them around a full day of sailing. This is a prime opportunity to build the party closer together and let them role play a bit. After a long day of sailing you see in the distance a small island. The island has little vegetation and is surrounded by a rocky beach. Jetting out from one side of the island is a long wooden dock, looking to be hundreds of years old. There is currently no boat anchored to the dock. Just a bit further on the island is a small hut looking to be made from wood taken from a ship. There is a warm glow from within the windows and smoke is bellowing out from the chimney. Feel free at this point to throw in another sea encounter using the table given on page 6 or another encounter crafted by the DM. -7--8- You find a journal that describes the many ventures of Trejonn and how he slayed many vampires with his special weapons. The Hunter's Secret As the players embark on the island, the door of the cottage opens and an ancient looking elf appears. His hair is gnarled and white and his beard hangs low to his mid section. He greets you and welcomes you into his home. His small hut is long with a small fireplace at the end. The walls are lined with shelves, and in the center of the room is a circular, stone pad embedded flush into the floor. The elf sits in a small wooden chair in the corner and ushers you to sit with him around the fire. After the party and Trejonn exchange introductions and the old hunter is updated on the vampire menace, he reluctantly explains that he is in no state to hunt the creatures anymore and has lost hope. He claims to have lost everything while hunting the creatures and no longer believes there is any point to stopping them. \"When one falls, two more rise up\", he claims somberly. The party will have little success in convincing him to fight with them, but there are some secrets to his home that are waiting to be discovered. 1-25 25-50 50-75 75-100 Investigation DC Detail You find a small circular, concave section in the middle of the stone pad. At the bottom of the indention there is a small gap. You find a hidden compartment behind one of the bookshelves that contains a crossb ow, a via l of holy wa ter, and a cloa k of the b a t. You find a ceremonial dagger hidden beneath a loose floor board. On the dagger is the elvish word for key. After a successful discovery of any of the above items, Trejonn will be more willing to talk depending on what you have discovered. If you just found the journa l, a DC of 18 is required, the stone indention is a DC of 16, the da gger is a DC of 14, a nd the hidden closet is a DC of 12. If the pa rty finds two or more items they get a dva nta ge on persua sion/intimida tion checks. Trejonn's Cellar 1 2 3 4 -9- Once the party convinces the old hunter to help them, he leads them over to the stone circle where he brandishes the ceremonial dagger and cuts open his palm. He holds his dripping palm over the small drain in the floor. As the blood from Trejonn's wrist falls into the small opening, the floor opens before the party as a spiral staircase descends leading down into a dark cellar. The old hunter points to the bottom and says, \"only a true hunter can retrieve the weapon from down there. Good luck to you all. \" He then hands you a small piece of paper with a quickly drawn map, and returns to his chair by the fire, tears welling in his eyes. 1. Cellar Entryway The steep spiral staircase leads down twenty feet underground. Once the party reaches the bottom a small dimly lit hallway stands before them. The hall before you is lit only by small magical orbs attached to the walls. The walls seem to be made of solid stone while the floor is covered in a lush, red cloth material. The pathway takes a slight curve before jeering off to the right, and a wooden door lies straight ahead at the end of the curved walkway. 2. Hallway of Blood This hallway is enchanted with a hidden mist. A character of a pa ssive perception of 15 will pick up that something magical is amiss. This mist will make the characters see hallucinations of some of their greatest fears. This is an area where the DM can get creative. If he/she knows the characters backstory, then have the mist take the form of something they know will terrify the said character. Each party member will experience the mist differently and a successful Dispel Ma gic spell (DC of 15) will clear the mist. If the party doesn't clear the mist, it is also fun to have them fight each other. Have each member believe that their party has become something they fear and have them attack. Drinking holy water will also dispel the mist and clear the head of anyone who drinks it. As you enter the hallway, your heads begin to pound painfully, and what was once real to you begins to shift right before your eyes. 3. Trejonn's Store Room This room is a small store room filled with baskets of food stores, rum, some basic weapons (short swords, daggers, rapiers, battleaxes), and a bag of wooden stakes. The room before you is a cluttered mess of bags of food, alcohol, and a scattered pile of weapons. There is also a large sack in the far corner. 4. Relic Room This 20x20 square room is plain except for a rectangular altar on the end of the room. The altar has a small chest sitting on top of it. The chest will not open for anything, but a blood offering. Any amount of blood placed on the altar will open the lock and reveal the treasure within. -10- As you enter this small room, you notice a rectangular altar on the far side of the room with a small chest on it. As you approach the chest you read the inscription across the altar, \"as life flows from you, onto this sacred space, hope will be revealed, the darkness begins to fade\". When chest opens it reveals five golden stakes. ea ch sta ke when wielded b y someone will tra nsform into the wea pon of their choice a nd do 3x da ma ge to va mpires or other undea d. As the stakes are removed, the cavern starts to crumble and try to bury the players. They will need to make three successful dexterity sa ves to esca pe unha rmed, otherwise they will suffer 1d10 bludgeoning damage for every fail on their way out. As you ascend into the room above, you see a vampire standing over the corpse of Trejonn, the creatures lips glisten with the blood of the fallen hunter, and without warning, he lunges at you with fangs bared. The Beginning of Death's End The creature before the party is a vampire spawn, and with their new weapons, should be disposed of quite easily. Once defeated, the players will be contacted by a spectral bird outside the house with a message describing the exact coordinates of the Piercing Light and the vampire pirates. The message notes that the Paladins have engaged the dark creatures and need assistance from the heroes. It should take the party a full day of sailing to rendezvous with the Piercing Light. Feel free to throw in a sea encounter on the way to shake things up. When they reach the scene there is wreckage everywhere. Warring Ships The piercing light sits before you on its last legs. there seems to be the splintered remains of other ships as well floating in the surf. The deck of the ship is stained with blood, and the remainder of the crew looks tired and battle worn. Celeste will greet the party and inform them that they engaged the vampires and had some success against a majority of the fleet. Losses were suffered on both sides, but the vampire's lead ship, The Maiden's Neck, escaped into a cove nearby. They are trapped and the times to attack is now. Celeste asks you to pursue the ship into the cove and finish off the vile creatures once and for all. She ensures you that they will join you once they get the ship back in battle shape, and the crew has recuperated a bit. -11- When the players enter the cove there will be no turning back. This may be a good time to remind the players to prepare for battle and rest up if they need to. They can restock some supplies on the Piercing Light, but as the ship and its crew just went through an intense battle, there will be little more than a few health potions to help them. As the players enter the cove they will see nothing. The Maiden's Neck is enchanted and floating safely under the water at the entrance to the cove. As soon as the player's ship crosses the threshold of the cove, the maiden's neck will rise up and block any exit from the cove. They will giant javelins into the hull of the players' vessel and stop it from moving. Around twenty vampires will immediately board the players' vessel and escort them aboard the Maiden's Neck. If the players choose not to be escorted and to fight, let the fight play out. The party will likely be killed. If the players oblige the creatures' request then move on to the final encounter. The Maiden's Neck You are led aboard the ship of the wretched vampire scourge. Lounging carelessly on his throne in the center of the deck sits the vampire Captain. A dead paladin corpse sits across his lap, completely drained of blood. As he sits stroking the dead woman's hair, he introduces himself as Dante Coldharbour and claims to have an offer than few could refuse. At this point Dante will give the players a choice. They can choose to join his crew, be turned into vampires, and aid him in overthrowing the great city of Waterdeep, or they can be killed and thrown overboard, never to be heard of again. Give the players a chance to choose. Dante will not let them leave the cove alive, one way or another. He wants his army and will have it no matter stands in his way. If the players choose to be turned, they can become vampire spawn in a day's time and will be recruited into Dante's forces. If they choose to fight, build some tension up to the moment of combat right before... As the undead crew approaches to destroy you, you notice in the distance a massive wave accelerating at incredible speed toward the Maiden's Neck. Atop the wave is the Piercing Light with several priests praying over the water, making it glow with holy light. As the wave crashes over the ship the vampires are burned to a crisp save for Dante Coldharbour who is able to turn into a cloud of mist at the last second and land safely back on the deck as the giant wave coasts further into the cove. The vampire captain stares at you with all of the hatred of Hell welling inside, as his comrades perish around him. He curses you one last time before beginning his attack. Dante is a very strong va mpire and will not be swayed from destroying the party. This battle will take place on a 50x50 square representing the deck of the ship. Outside the square are pools of the holy water that washed over the ship earlier. When the party defeats Dante: The Vampire Lord screams as he disintegrates into a smouldering pile of ash. The Piercing Light and its crew sail over to find you standing over the ashes of the vampire captain. Celeste thanks you for your service and rewards you with the ship you've been traveling on in addition to anything you find on the Maiden's Neck. The contents of the Maiden's Neck include: 360 Gold 24 Platinum 1 book of religious scriptures and prayers (25 gp) 1 set of thieves' tools (25 gp) 1 book of religious scriptures and prayers (25 gp) 1 disguise kit (25 gp) 7 lbs. of gold trade bars (350 gp) 11 bottle(s) of common wine (2.2 gp) satin robe worth 250gp feather robe worth 250gp Horseshoes of speed Potion of gaseous form Potion of superior healing Dancing Sword Congratulations you have completed Sea of Blood! -12- NPC Stats Trejonn De Laperre Medium Humanoid Elf, Chaotic Good Armor Class 13 (leather armor) Hit Points 33 (6d8 + 6) Speed 30 ft.
