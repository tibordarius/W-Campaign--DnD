You will need a copy of the Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition Players Handbook, as well as the Dungeons Masters Guide for rewarding your players with treasure, and the Monster Manual, Mordenkainen’s Tome Of Foes and Volo’s Guide To Monsters for the creatures your players will encounter. ___________________________________________ At some points along the module you will see an entry marked similar to as follows: † 3x Hill Giant (CR 5, MM115) Medium encounter, 5400exp This marks a combat encounter, and you refer to the correct Monster stat block. It tells you how many of what kind of monster take part in the encounter, and in brackets their individual Challenge Rating and the book they can be found in. Where the Challenge Rating is followed by the note “Special”, the creature’s stat block can be found in this module, usually shortly after the encounter. The bottom line denotes the difficulty of the encounter, and the collective EXP reward for completing it (which is shared amongst the party). ___________________________________________ Abbreviations At some points through this module you will encounter some abbreviations, especially in notes for combat encounters. These are explained as follows. Their exact meanings are explained in the Players Handbook. EXP: Experience Points HP: Hit Points AC: Armour Class DC: Difficulty Class MM: Monster Manual MTF: Mordenkainen’s Tome Of Foes VGM: Volo’s Guide To Monsters Reading The Adventure Setting This adventure is designed to fit into any setting, any world, so long as it is in a mundane mortal and physical plane of existence. It is intended to be able to neatly slot into any world you wish - Faerun, Dark Sun, Dragonlance, or one of your own creation. It will work in any world. As such, feel free to make whatever adjustments you feel necessary for the world you are using, including altering names and locations to better fit the world your players are used to travelling and adventuring in. ____________________________________________ Game Balance Island Adventures has been designed to suit any level of adventurer, offering notes in each entry for possibly combat encounters. Depending on the number and level of players in your party, you are encouraged to adapt any such notes as you see fit. ____________________________________________ Reading Any open text such as this paragraph can be read aloud if you wish as it provides background and game information, including descriptions of people and locations which enhance the character of the game the players are in. ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t Text in grey boxes such as this should not be read aloud. This text is DM only information which reveals secrets and offers advice on what to do should players choose certain avenues of exploration and combat. It also provides combat tactics for monsters which the players should be made aware of directly. CHARACTER “Text in bordered yellow boxes such as this one is dialogue – specific words to be spoken by specific characters at various points in the game to bring players deeper into the narrative by roleplaying along with the Non-Player characters around them.” 2 The sea is wide and treacherous, and yet open and inviting to those seeking exploration and adventure. Setting out across the waters of the world is an intriguing and captivating thought for Dungeons & Dragons, mimicking the great voyages of epic heroes such as Sinbad, or perhaps going out in search of danger or revenge like Crusoe and Ahab. Or perhaps they go seeking opportunity and plunder like the pirates of old, casting off the shackles of land authority and claiming the freedom that only a sturdy hull and a full sail can provide. The Island Adventures offers you a collection of short, one-shot adventures – random challenges a party might encounter whilst at sea. Perhaps they are on a grander quest or simply exploring for explorations sake, but these adventures are designed to fit into any greater adventure as stand alone distractions. _______________________________________________________________ THE PIECES OF EIGHT Also included in this module is a singular campaign, THE PIECES OF EIGHT, which sets a party on a mission to recover eight artifacts which promise great reward should they be reunited. This quest is designed to be set up, and then the party can set out onto the sea to explore where they will, and find adventure where it is to be found. Along the way, they can complete the eight missions in this pack to earn one of the eight artifacts from each, before bring them all together for a final reward. _____________________________________________ USING THE ISLAND ADVENTURES Besides using them as a unified quest, the Island Adventures can also be used as standalone gameplay sessions. Each of the Island Adventures takes place as the Island Adventures names make clear – upon an island somewhere out in the seas of whatever world you have chosen to set your game. Each entry which follows is a small island, with notes detailing everything of interest a party might find upon it so that you don’t feel you need to improvise. You should however feel free to adapt any of these adventures to better suit specific quests you are running (perhaps by altering the monsters to feel more familiar to a region) or even to better fit with your own whim (if there are items or dangers you prefer personally. _______________________________________________________________ You will find on this page a table listing all twenty of the adventures offered in this pack, allowing you to either choose one for yourself, or to determine one at random if you prefer a surprise. If you do want to randomize an Island Adventure, simply roll 1d8 and check the table below. It is suggested if you do randomly determine an adventure, that you as DM make sure to read that specific adventure through first thoroughly so that you are aware of its details and possible pitfalls. It is better for the DM to know what is coming than to later realize that a mistake has been made, and the intended resolution is impossible.

Haggard quite possibly well beyond his years, he is bearded and grey-haired, and sits with the hunched disposition of one defeated by life. His clothes are nautical, but long-worn. The old man, who introduces himself as Bellamy, tells many stories of his youth, sailing the high seas as an adventurer and pirate. He talks long about good friends, valiant acts or heroism, and exciting sexual encounters in all corners of the world. Bellamy will speak long into the night to anyone who gives him ample attention, and will even happily buy drinks for anyone who will put up with his stories. Eventually though, in the early hours of the morning, he will retire and stumble out of the door towards his own home. _______________________________________________________________ Morning will come, and the party will be about their own business, when Bellamy will come again. This time though there is a look of determination about him as he limps on his wooden leg towards whomever was gracious (or piteous) enough to give him their attention last night. He comes this time clutching a satchel at his side. The Pieces Of Eight Bellamy speaks extremely hopefully, and if the party (or characters) consent he will lead them into a nearby tavern, sit them down, and reveal to them the legend of the Pieces of Eight. _______________________________________________________________ THE PIECES OF EIGHT Once the party are settled in the tavern, he will begin relating the legend of the Pieces Of Eight to them. DC18 Arcana: A character who passes has of course heard of these legendary beings, powerful elemental beings many believe are simply a fantastical story too amazing to be true. They are described as proud and majestic, though sometimes capricious in their nature.

BELLAMY “But it all came to a tragic end. My life cut short, and now I find myself stuck in shitholes like this, drinking piss water and reliving old tales.” “A glass eye. A wooden leg. I bet they’d have replaced my lungs with stone if they could have.” “My old companions have long since left me behind, useless to them in this state. I can’t fight. I can’t sail. I can’t do anything of use to anyone anymore.” BELLAMY “You there! You!” “I know your type. I know it very well. You’re adventurers aren’t you. Questers.” “Out in the world for some purpose of your own I’d wager good money, but having a blast of a time along the way. Adventure! Treasure! And a lot more besides!” “You were good enough to grant me your attention, so I’ll plead my case for a little more. I wish your help. I wish to employ you! Or perhaps enlist is a better term for it.” “I severely lament my current situation, but I believe there is a way to resolve it. A legend I knew about in my youth but could never seek out myself. Something I have researched since, and believe I have the solution to. Great reward awaits if you’re willing and if you’re daring.” “Are you interested?!” BELLAMY “Tell me good folk, have you ever heard of such a creature as a Djinni?” BELLAMY “Powerful beings they are. Mighty even!” “And it is said, that some have the power even to rewrite reality. It is said that Djinni can be immensely grateful to those that aid them when they are in distress, and are powerful enough to grant any wish a person might make of them. The strongest, those that are nobles amongst their own people, can change ANYTHING.” “Long ago, there was such a creature walking these very lands. Kidizinam. The Weaver. That’s what they called him.” “It was cruel at times, kind at others. But it came into conflict with those that sought its power, and was felled. But slain it could not be, and so these 4 DC18 Arcana: The description given seems fantastic, but not beyond the realm of possibility for a powerful arcane spellcaster. Thinking it over, there are some spells which could be used to accomplish this feat – perhaps True Polymorph to transmute the Djinni’s form into a gold ingot, and then Fabricate to turn that ingot into coins. From his satchel, Bellamy withdraws a map of the local sea. On it, eight regions have been circled, though each is still a significant area. Bellamy’s plan is that he will go elsewhere whilst the party gather the coins. He says he knows of a ritual which can be used to reverse the spell cast on Kidizinam, but he must seek out specific details and the ingredients. He is confident that he will be fully prepared for when they return. After the party set out on their mission, Bellamy will happily drink with them to toast the quest, and the following day will set out to fulfill his own side of the task – to gather the materials necessary and to confirm the exact mechanics of the ritual to release the Djinni from the coins. _______________________________________________________________ THE COINS Each coin is an intricately designed piece of high artistic merit. Each is roughly two inches in diameter and one third of an inch thick. Made of what can only be discerned as pure 24 karat gold. Each face has the same the design on it, a distinctive set of arcane runes unfamiliar to the casual observer but of deep significance to one who has studied the arcane arts in a practical manner. The designs are very old, and suggest not only deep and ancient arcane power, but also the working of dark and powerful gods at the behest of a powerful caster, or one who is owed a debt. ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t BELLAMY [continued] powerful people, adventurers such as we I suspect, were able to tightly bound the Djinni with powerful magics such that it could never escape!” “So it is said, they were able to transform the Djinni’s form into an ingot of solid gold, and from that crafted eight golden coins, splitting the Djinni’s essence between them!” BELLAMY “I have had time to consider this legend. And I believe it to be true!” BELLAMY “These places. These are where I believe the ancient adventurers scattered the coins in order to prevent them from reuniting again.” “It is my every intention to seek them out. To find them, reunite them and to free Kidizinam. And in its gratitude I will ask the Djinni to restore my health. To make me whole again so that I can go on with a decent life!” “If the legends are to be believed, different Djinni can and will grant different amounts of wishes. This one I believe is strong enough for more than one.” “So I make the offer. I ask you to take this map, and to gather the coins on my behalf. I can not sail myself, but if you can go out and retrieve the Pieces Of Eight, and then bring them back to me, I can do what is necessary to free the Djinni. I will take the first wish, and any that remain will be yours.” “What say you?” If the party agree, Bellamy will be overjoyed and excited at his plan thus far working out. He will hand over the map with eight circled regions which will lead the party to eight islands. This sets up the use of the eight stand alone Island Adventures missions presented in this module under a single unified quest. As an optional way of introducing this quest, it is possible you may have used one of the eight adventures already as a stand alone adventure. The coin gathered from that will generate interest if the party tries to find information on it, or if they try to sell it. Bellamy will hear of it and approach them, telling them the legend and again asking for their help. If the party did sell the coin, Bellamy will acquire it and bring it back to them. DC15 Arcana: The nature of the designs suggests the influence of Old Ones, both in the binding upon them and the nature of the casting. This act was achieved by one under the patronage of a dark dimensional being. 5 Each coin is hefty, feeling heavier than this amount of gold really should, and to one who can detect such things clearly radiates a magical aura. The binding magic upon them is too much for simple mortal spells though, and can not be broken by common dispelling magics. A more specific ritual such as the one Bellamy plans is the only way to undo this ancient magic. _______________________________________________________________ ASSEMBLING THE COINS After the party have gathered the eight coins, they must be taken to Bellamy for the final ritual. The magic cast upon them is extremely resilient, and standard magical dispelling simply does not work on them. Only the ritual Bellamy has in mind will reverse the spell and free the Djinni hidden within. Bellamy can be found exactly where he was before, in taverns about a city, waiting for the party eagerly. As soon as the party do return he is overcome with excitement and takes them to a private room, insisting that the ritual be carried out immediately. He has waited too long he says, and will not wait another moment. Bellamy will happily tell the story while he is preparing, of his journey further inland to an ancient temple. There he spoke with many monks and priests who gave him the details he wanted. His route back detoured to gather a few important and necessary ingredients, but he is now prepared to get the ritual underway. _______________________________________________________________ Bellamy begins by arranging a collection of thirteen lit candles in a circle upon the floor, and then begins to draw lines between each and every candle whilst muttering words in Celestial. When he is done, Bellamy turns to the party. With each coin placed within the circle, a faint sparkling aura will start to shine within the space. The coins placed within the circle will vibrate, and each further coins causes the aura to shine brighter and brighter until wisps of blue energy start to fly within the area. As the final coin is placed within, the light will shine bright and sustain that level. The eight coins will rise, and before the party’s eyes lose cohesion and turn to liquid gold, the fluid joining and becoming part of the blue energy wisps flying around the circular space. Bellamy will say a few final words, and the wisps will all join together. A flash of blinding blue light fills the space, and as it abates the party find that fills the space, and as it abates the party find that the drawn circle, the candles, wisps and coins are all gone. What stands in their place is a large gold skinned humanoid – the Djinni Kidizinam freed at last and standing in the middle of the party. The Djinni outstretches his arms, and speaks in a boisterous voice. By all accounts Kidizinam comes across as a very jolly and almost festive being, truly grateful for its freedom. ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t BELLAMY “The circle and star are complete.” “Now, place the coins into the circle, one by one!” Close examination of the candles suggests that they are made of an unusual wax. Bellamy will call them “special”, but not reveal anything further. DC18 Nature: the wax is from Human ears. The chalk Bellamy uses to draw lines across the floor appears to be lined with silver, making the drawn lines shine in the candlelight. Finally, the words he is muttering can only be understood by a character who knows the Celestial language. They appear to be prayers in an ancient variant of the language to all gods, asking for the work of “Dark Ones” to be undone. KIDIZINAM “Finally! After so many years I am free! Free to see the sky and to feel the wind on my face!” “Free to know the world and its peoples again and anew.” “My thanks to you, little things. You who have done this thing for me!” KIDIZINAM “Joyous I am at my own recognisance, and grateful I am for your aid in my time of peril. Unto you shall I granted TWO wishes.” “Any two deeds you desire, name them, and they shall be yours!” 6 Bellamy will immediately speak, claiming the wish he feels owed as his due for bringing the party to this quest and this point. The old pirate speaks up loudly, wishing for a restoration of his health, and the physical body he had as a healthy young man. Swirls of violet energy snake from the Djinni’s outpointed hand to encircle and then wrap around Bellamy. Within moments those swirls dissipate, and in Bellamy’s place stands a young, vibrant and healthy young man with a massive grin on his face. The young man could be Bellamy’s son, but the party know better – it is Bellamy himself as he appeared in his much more youthful and healthy days. He is young, skinny, and has his own two eyes and his own two legs again. Bellamy looks to the party, his greatest desire granted and he now satisfied. He picks up his satchel, turns, and moves towards the door. With a grateful and honest nod, the smiling boy departs. The Djinni’s second wish is now theirs. As the second wish is clearly and intentionally made, the Djinni grins, points towards the party, and again violent swirls of energy loop out from his hand, down his finger and out into the world. The wish is granted – mostly. And with it Kidizinam disappears, leaving only a puff of blue smoke to fade away where he once stood. _______________________________________________________________ ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t KIDIZINAM! BELLAMY “It worked! By all that is holy it worked!” KIDIZINAM “This first wish is granted. And your second?” The wish conferred onto the party as their reward for freeing the Djinni works as per the Wish spell (PHB288). Kidizinam is not entirely benevolent though, and like most of his kind has a mind for trickery and will either grant the wish VERY literally, or find some way to twist the intent of the wish so that it is granted in only a very technical way. Wishing someone to life for example may result in reincarnation rather than resurrection. Wishing an enemy dead may turn them into a powerful undead Lich. Wishing for vast hordes of gold may see the tavern crushed under a suddenly appearing mountain of gold. As such the players must be careful what they wish for, and how they wish for it. As DM, you may well also wish to limit what your party can wish for so as not to imbalance your future games. You need not explicitly say so, but the Djinni can twist the party’s intent to something more balanced to the setting and games you have planned. He might even move them across the world if you wish, or to another world entirely, to a place where you plan to take them on new adventures. 7 On a small beach at the edge of a forested island, the party spy a large ship perched upon the shore. Its hull broken, its mast fallen and its sail long since lost. The ship does not appear old, much of it appearing to be of fairly modern design by local standards. Yet it stands silent and unoccupied. The island, roughly two hundred and fifty to three hundred feet in diameter, is covered mostly in dense woodland pierced only by three jagged hilltops of dark rock. The south-west corner of the island is home to a sand beach, on which sits the wreck of a wooden ship, its cargo spilled out onto the sand. As the party make land, they see crates and debris littering the beach, and can obviously make out large holes in the hull of the ship in its front left and middle right sections. The wood there has been shattered as if by great force. There are no signs of any crew, nor are there any bodies. The ship shifts slightly in the sand when the party climb onto it, but soon settles and appears stable enough to be explored. _______________________________________________________________ THE HOLD In the lower section of the ship, the party find several broken barrels which once held supplies. Crates which once contained food now lie empty, and a few empty hammocks drift in the slight breeze. Towards the centre of the hold, the party find the first evidence of what may have happened – three broken metal cages, the bars torn apart, each a good size for a medium to large humanoid. The metal bars of the cages are still strong, but have 1. Shipwreck ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t been bent out of place by something extremely physically powerful. _______________________________________________________________ THE DECK On the top deck the party find the sort of accoutrements you would expect on a ship – rope, rigging and other tools in reasonably good condition. Towards the back a set of broken stairs lead up to the bridge where the wheel appears to be broken, some force having hit it and split it into two. A dark patch just behind suggest dried blood. Beneath the bridge a door swings gently in the wind, leading into the Captain’s Cabin. _______________________________________________________________ THE CAPTAINS CABIN Within the cabin below the bridge, they discover the one and only body on the entire ship. Decayed and infested with assorted insects, a humanoid figure in extremely fine black silk, overlaid with a red and gold coat lies with arms and legs outstretched, a sword just out of reach of one of its hands. The body is mostly intact, but a large gash across its midsection is the obvious cause of death, something Points of interest: •  Little animal life beyond a few rodents and exotic berry or fish eating birds. •  Tropical flora and fauna, with access to coconuts and various edible berries. DC15 Investigation: The condition of the wood seems to suggest that the ship has not been here long. Weeks, maybe months have passed since it got here. A year at the most. DC20 Investigation: From the dispersal pattern of the debris, it seems that the hull was broken from the inside out. The scattering of wood also suggests that the hull was intact when it landed, but was broken afterwards. DC18 Perception: A decent search of the area will uncover a bag of rotten fruit. It is an odd looking fruit, and the smell suggests something out of the ordinary. A substantial whiff of the rotten remains will make a character briefly woozy. Once the fruit has been discovered, it can be identified by someone with the correct knowledge. DC18 Nature: The fruit appears to be that of the Tallyman Oak, known to be used as an ingredient in sleeping potions and tranquilizers. The crew of this ship may have been using the raw fruit to keep something docile. The fruit as it is now (in a rotten state) is no use for anything. 8 having taken a large chunk out of its side. The room is decked out in finery, the wealth around and the number of ledgers making it clear that this person was some kind of tradesman at the very least, or perhaps a successful smuggler. The bed is made with comfortable linen, and the table is carved of excellent quality mahogany (though both are broken and torn from the impact which beached the vessel. Triggered Event - THE HOWLING •  As any characters finish exploring the Captains Cabin, leave the wrecked ship, or set any fires for any reason. The party will become alerted by a loud and visceral howl which fills the air around the island. Resembling the anger of man rather than any normal beast it will instantly alert them to danger nearby. From the north edge of the beach a predator emerges, sniffing at the air, its teeth grinding in anticipation of fresh meat. As the party spy it, a second will emerge on the other side of the ship, pacing through the hole in the ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t vessel’s midsection and making for the party’s rear. † Shipwrecked Beasts (see page 28) _______________________________________________________________ Defeating the two creatures will leave the island once again quiet save for the chirping of birds and slow wash of the sea lapping against the beach. On each of the two creatures the party find a set of shackles about the ankles, identifying them as former captives and the contents of the cages on the shipwrecked ship. There were however three cages, and of the third creature there is absolutely no sign. The island is peaceful again, the disturbance gone and all danger has passed. DC15 Medicine: Judging from the size and nature of the wound, a good eye will judge that this person was actually pulled apart, and this wound is a rip, not a cut. On the Captain’s body, the party are able to find: •  A good quality red coat with gold trim, torn in several places. •  A gold ring with a seagull sigil on it worth approximately 25gp. •  A pouch containing 17sp. Elsewhere in the room, the only items of value which do not seem damaged are: •  A small locked wooden chest. If opened, it contains 32ep, and a small wood etching of a young girl. •  A portrait of an officious woman in a tight noble-woman’s dress. She appears to be scowling in a disapproving way. It is labeled “My Love”. It is however a very well painted piece of art. The ship is badly damaged, and even with a lot of care and attention, it is unlikely it can be made to sail again. Any craftsman would look on it as a source of materials only, or firewood at the very worst. The party can salvage parts from the ship should they need them or find any value in them, but must eventually leave most of the hull here where time and the sea can claim it. The Captain is also in possession of a fine golden coin with a distinctive arcane crest upon it. This is one of the coins required for the PIECES OF EIGHT quest. 9 A gentle breeze, a sparkling waterfall and a pristine lagoon invite the party in for a peaceful and pleasant rest. This is not a place of danger, but a trove of fresh fruit, and relaxation. In nearly every regard, the lagoon and the beaches on its west and east sides are ideal, the sand shores broken only by a beautiful sparkling waterfall which descends from the side of a small mountain. Upon finding their way there, the party are at once captivated and find the idea of relaxing here for a spell almost too inviting. 2. The Enchanting Lagoon ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t CAUGHT BY THE SPELL Those under the charm of the lagoon have an odd sparkle in their eyes, and a strong desire to never have to leave the island. They are entirely captivated by the splendor of the place. Those who notice something is wrong can track the source of the problem to a faint glow at the bottom of the lagoon. Whatever is down there, they feel that it is pulling at them somehow and trying to influence their minds. _______________________________________________________________ UNDER THE WATERS It seems clear that the only way to rescue those member of the party caught by the spell on this island is to explore whatever is down there. Even if none of the party are caught by the spell of the lagoon, there is a suggestion of something magical happening under the water, maybe even some treasure they can claim for themselves. The lagoon is around 200ft in diameter, and reaches 100ft deep at its middle point. Attempts to get down to the bottom are also perilous, as characters will have to pass by the creatures who live in the deeper areas and actively try to defend the magical source. † Lagoon Snappers (see page 28) _______________________________________________________________ THE LOST TRAVELLER The centre point is easy to lock onto as even a cursory glance focuses on something glowing with a golden light. As the party approach it becomes even clearer, and soon the party realize that it is a humanoid form. Chained to a large boulder resting at the bottom of the lagoon’s centre, the party find a clothed human. His flesh is mostly gone, either having decayed away or been consumed by the ravenous fish that reside here. The chains are strong, and firmly bound around the Points of interest: •  Many sweet and delicious fruits and berries. •  A multitude of small animals, rodents and birds. •  The higher mountains in the north west and south east corners are rich sources of herbs and flowers common in healing poultices. The party are at once caught in what is actually a magical effect attracting them to the area. The effect is captivating but also revitalizing, healing wounds and making all old injuries feel like no trouble at all. Aches fade, and mental worries are all but forgotten. On first arrival it’s a low level field barely readable by those capable of reading magic. As they stay longer however, the effect becomes stronger and more noticeable. After a bit of time in the lagoon, the characters must start making Wisdom Saving Throws at DC18. Any character who fails is charmed by the lagoon, wanting to stay at all costs. Characters who pass slowly become aware of the effect, and realize that there is some kind of magic pull on them emanating from the lagoon. 10 human’s body. This is an obvious execution, this poor victim having been drowned for some unknown crime. In its arms, held in a skeletal grip and bound within the same chains holding the body underwater, the party see the source of the glowing – a golden device of intricate pipes wrapped and molded as a musical instrument. From the clothes the body is wearing, and the instrument in its hands, it is easily assumed that this poor soul was a musician, and this the tool of his trade. The instrument draws the eye, a masterwork of great beauty and presumably enchanted to enhance the natural musical abilities of whoever plays it. The drowned bard carries nothing else with them. _______________________________________________________________ Removing the instrument from the water ends the magical effect. It will cease to glow, and any character charmed by the lagoon will come to their senses immediately. For all intents and purposes, the lagoon is now perfectly ordinary, and no longer magically captivates as it once did. ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t HORN OF CHARM Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a Bard) In the hands of a gifted musician, this horn can create a beautiful melody which stirs peace in those who hear it. Once per day you can use an action to play the horn and cast either Charm Monster (single target) or Charm Person (affecting all creatures within 20ft). Alternatively, you may choose to give your party an Instrument Of The Bards (DMG176). As the party inspect the horn or try to use it or put it away, they find that it rattles as though something were within it. Whatever it is prevents the horn from being used properly. With a little effort (mostly just shaking the horn) a small object falls out. It is a fine golden coin with a distinctive arcane crest upon it. This is one of the coins required for the PIECES OF EIGHT quest. 11 The party approach an island with a single large peak on its western side, the woodland covering its surface broken over its middle revealing a small collection of primitive huts surrounding what, from a distance, appears to be a mast at the centre of the village. What draws the attention though is an odd green glow emanating from the top of the mast. From off-shore, the party can make a few people moving about between the huts, and they look humanoid. As they pass or approach they realize that the islanders have noticed them and are calling and waving to them in what seems to be a very inviting way. They have smiles on their faces and large fruit in their arms. A group of adults can be seen constructing a new hut in the village, and a group of children play in the waters. As the party approach shore they get a better view of the wooden huts, all made from bound bundles of long, straight branches taken from the native trees. All are roughly rounded, with a domed roof bound in four corners with large leaves draped over the top to provide simple waterproofing. The villagers are dressed in a mix of simple leather hides and coverings made from reed, rope and leaves. _______________________________________________________________ 3. Ferality ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t As soon as the party set foot on land they are greet warmly, offered fresh and tantalizing fruit, even some small bits of recently cooked fish from a grill on the shore. Children crowd around them, speaking and questioning in the local language which players have a hard time understanding. _______________________________________________________________ At the centre of the small village the party get their first clear view of the glowing object on the top of the mast. The mast in fact appears to be a totem pole. It is of simple design, a single straight log with a variety of images shallowly carved into its surface depicting large, monstrous beasts with open jaws. In some examples the creatures appear winged, possibly demonic. At the peak of the totem a pair of wooden planks spread out like wings either side of a set of hooks resembling a brazier holding a large dark green rock in place about 30ft off the ground. The green rock emits a pulsing glow which seems to hum at extremely close range to the totem. The party are brought before it, where many villagers starts to raise their arms towards the rock and venerate it. Points of interest: •  Several small animals make their home here, the woods filled with beasts resembling boar, deer and large wild cats. •  Numerous fruit bearing trees and bushes litter the terrain. The natives also have small fenced areas within their village where they have planted simple and sustainable wheat crops. If characters use magic to understand, they discern welcoming gestures, and conversation on how odd the strangers look. There seems to be an effort to invite the strangers into the centre of the village. DC18 Investigation: The log the mast is made of appear to be too straight for local manufacture. It also has a few holes and design details which appear regular enough to suggest that this was once a ship’s mast. If any characters are able to understand the local language through the use of magic or special abilities, they make out a mixture of prayers and declarations to a god the locals are call “Um- dreck”. Apparently they believe that the green rock was sent to them by Um-dreck long ago as a token of his favour. It landed from the sky and destroyed a neighboring island where “unclean ones” resided. It is clearly an item of magical power, and investigation by one trained in magical forces can identify it as a large sample of Urs-Rock, an exotic and powerful magical substance with great destructive properties. It is extremely dangerous, and also very valuable. 12 Triggered Event – FERAL HEARTS •  Should any player try to touch or take the green rock of Um-dreck, or at sundown. The village will remain peaceful throughout the day, offering a place to rest and maybe even trade if the party are able to establish communication. However all of this will change should the party attempt to touch or take the green rock, or when the sun goes down. Once triggered, the villagers will immediately turn hostile to the party. They will remain happy and gleeful, but in each the party will recognize a green glow flaring in their eyes. Every island native from adult to infant will start to twist and warp, their bones breaking and repositioning, their fingers and toes extended, their nails and teeth lengthening to become vicious blades. Spikes and horns will sprout from their bodies, and they will all as one charge at the nearest party member to them, shrieking with delight. † Feral Villagers (see page 28) ______________________________________________________________ ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t It is possible that come sundown, a party member may want to use the cover of darkness to steal or examine the rock. In this case, the event can still be triggered, but it may be better to delay a little for dramatic effect. The only way to put them down for good is to destroy the rock and end its effect on them. To destroy the rock, the party must deal at least 20 points of damage to it, however it is immune to Piercing, Bludgeoning and Piercing damage. Anything else will cause it to fracture and leak a sick green light and start to hum with increasing volume. 1d4 turns after being split (during which the Feral Villagers continue to attack) the rock will explode dealing 3d6 necrotic damage to any creature within a 30ft radius. Player characters can attempt to pass a DC16 Constitution save for half damage. As the rock explodes, its light lingers for a few moments before disappearing entirely. Every villager drops to the ground and begins to decompose with alarming speed, as though it were only the power of the rock keeping them in their living state for this length of time. The rock itself will shatter and drop to the ground as fragments, all devoid of any remaining power. If the party try to escape with the rock, they will find every Feral Villager chasing it down trying to reclaim it and put it back where it belongs. If the party DO escape, they will have the rock which is of no value to commoners, but of great value to a Wizard interested in destructive magic (approximately 500gp). The Feral Villagers fight to the last, taking perverse delight in attempts to cut down the party, and constantly regenerating thanks to the power of the Rock of Um-Dreck. Inside the tribal chieftain’s hut, the party can find a few trinkets which may have washed ashore. Amongst them though is a fine golden coin with a distinctive arcane crest upon it. This is one of the coins required for the PIECES OF EIGHT quest. 13 On the horizon a small atoll comes into view, a tiny island barely larger than the party’s own ship, but from it rises a small plume of smoke. As they approach they spy an open fire, and next to it a man waving in the air calling to them, the atoll littered with wooden debris presumably from this marooned soul’s previous vessel. As the party approach the man begins cheering with sheer delight, calling out in desperation and with the hope he can muster for rescue. As the party approach he calls to them, and if need be he begs and pleads to be brought onboard, and agrees to do anything they ask of him in return. As he comes onboard he is overly thankful for the rescue, and praises everyone on board in the names of every good god he can think of. _______________________________________________________________ A young man, malnourished and exhausted from being out in the sun, the man introduces himself by the name Ramon. •  Ramon is objectively an extremely handsome young man. The sort who, in some places, might be able to live a comfortable life relying on his looks alone, or might one day be the subject of a narrative on the subject of eternal youth and beauty. •  On arrival, he only has an extremely worn and ragged pair of trousers left. He has no other clothing on. •  He says he was a galley-hand on a vessel called the Combatant, working for a smuggler named Eurl Kristofsen. •  He had set out from a city quite close to the party’s own departure point (though not the same city – feel free to choose a city for yourself). •  At some point along the crossing, someone on board ship had been found murdered. He suspected the Boatswain as there was a feud involved, but Ramon had been accused and marooned. The wreckage littering the atoll was already here, the result of a previous shipwreck. _______________________________________________________________ Ramon swears he had no role in the death, and thanks the gods again for the party rescuing him. The party’s journey will continue from there, Ramon extremely happy to be dropped at the first inhabited 4.

Conversations with Ramon will always be extremely pleasant, and Ramon will prove to be surprisingly knowledgeable on absolutely any subject, including any specialist subject of the person he is speaking to. The name Kristofsen will be familiar to any characters with a nautical or sailing background, or who have spent time conversing with sailors and seeking out rumours of the sea. He’s a somewhat notorious smuggler and swashbuckler, a man of great charisma who commands both respect and comradeship. DC18 Insight: Ramon appears to be telling the truth about everything, but there is a hint that he is hiding something. He does not however appear hostile in any way. It is very easy to assume that a party of players will be suspicious of Ramon the moment you as DM put him amongst them. In order to assuage them, you might want to consider extending his time amongst them before carrying on with the rest of this adventure. Instead of moving on from here, considering leaving Ramon amongst them as they continue to go about their other quests. Perhaps he can be useful to them, or show skills (such as cooking) which convince the party to keep him around when he asks. This way he can earn their trust over time. RAMON! 14 One night, either the night after he is rescued or much further down the line after he has earned the party’s trust, Ramon will find an opportunity to have a private conversation with a member of the party. It will be pleasant and informative, but then Ramon will do something unexpected. He will lean forward and try to kiss the character. After the kiss concludes, either by a successful resistance check or Ramon releasing the grip, Ramon forcefully knocks the character out onto the deck (or flees there himself if it’s a large/heavy character). He will at first try to hide, but will recognize that as futile should the character he attacked come after him or call out an alarm. If he encounters another party member before an ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t In reality, the character Ramon is speaking to is slowly becoming magically charmed. He is taking his time to learn about every party member, and then trying to find ways to have private one-on-one conversations during which he can assert his charm. alarm is raised, he will say that his first victim is in trouble and needs help, and use whatever opportunity he can to escape the situation and reach the top deck. Once there he will try to escape, but when finally cornered, he will turn and begin openly mocking the party. He will claim to have uncovered all their secrets, and call them fools as a set of leather wings emerge from his previous smooth skinned back. Ramon then leaps into the air, diving into the rigging and using that vantage point to gain the benefit of cover, swooping down to strike and strafe before returning to the air. † Marooned Incubus (see page 29) _____________________________________________________________ __ Once defeated, Ramon drops to the deck where he will eventually bleed to death, claiming to have loved them all. He will still have a smile on his face, and as he dies will make one last attempt at charming a party member for a final kiss (which will revitalize him). If he is able to get that final kiss, he will heal enough to attempt an escape, and will fly off into the night. His laughter fades into the distance. If Ramon escaped, he will not return. As the night wears on though, whether Ramon was slain or not, party members who try to sleep find themselves dreaming of conversations they had with the young-looking man, and finding it hard to think ill of him. Those who spoke with him most, and his evening’s first intended victim have the deepest sleep and the most vivid dreams, speaking with Ramon on more personal subjects they never discussed in reality. The party never sets eyes on him again. The character will at once know something is wrong, but feel like they’re not in total control. Their body is acting, but their subconscious tells them something is very wrong. *Note that Ramon does not care about the race, sex, gender, or sexuality of his companion. He is Pansexual, and will try it on with absolutely anyone. His only limitation is that he will not make advances on or attempt this with an Elf, because they are of course immune to being Charmed. *Also note, that Ramon will never go further than attempting to kiss his victim, DC16 Wisdom Save: If passed the character is able to force control of their own body and break out of the spell. Should they fail, the character takes 1d10 Psychic damage as Ramon kisses them. The character feels as though they are being drained of vital life energy as the kiss goes on, and their hit points maximum is reduced by the damage taken until they take a Long Rest. After the first amount of damage, the character may attempt to resist the spell again, taking more damage if they fail again. If the test is failed a third time, then Ramon will be his own undoing. He will deal his damage for a third time but in his fervor will knock over a nearby stack of crates, causing a large sound. This will alert other party members. Note that this damage will not kill. If the affected party member is reduced to 0 hit points, then they are left stable at that point and will not need to make Death Saving Throws. On his body, or in a pouch he drops as he escapes, the party will find a few trinkets of their own that Ramon had clearly stolen as keepsakes! If the party are on the PIECES OF EIGHT quest, they will also discover all of the coins bearing the distinctive arcane crest they had so far collected, plus an additional one! Ramon it seems had one of the coins already, and was taking this opportunity to take the others. 15 A single peak rises up from the ocean, a mountain island at the heart of a forested island. Occasional bursts of steam jet out from caves in the east face of the mountain. Coming ashore, the party find the island quiet beyond the occasional squawk of birds and snuffling of boar. As they explore, they find nothing inherently dangerous until they approach the mountain where jets of steam leave the rock slightly damp. _______________________________________________________________ THE MOUNTAIN The rocky base of the mountain makes climbing the side of the mountain simple enough, and the jets of steam make finding a cave entrance easy. The opening of the camp is damp, and the air extremely warm and humid. Air appears to suck in, and then rush out again as though the mountain were breathing. _______________________________________________________________ VENTURING INSIDE The caves are extremely muggy, air sucking in and then expelling out again in jets of hot steam, hot enough to cause discomfort although not enough to do any sort of physical harm. The caves wind through multiple tunnels, eventually bringing the party to a large chamber which starts to open out but then ends abruptly with a solid wall. It looks rocky, but its surface is somehow distinct from the rest of the rock. 5. The Sleeping Beast ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t A part of the wall shifts, and splits apart horizontally, revealing a massive glaring orb, like a deep round void bordered by nebulaic rings of colour. It shifts back and forth, taking in the party, and then suddenly the wall starts to move. The caves - the whole mountain – starts to shake violently as the creature, whatever it is, starts to move. The entire mountain starts to split as the titanic creature wakes and starts to rise, breaking free of the stone which has formed around it over many long centuries of slumber. Rock falls and the island breaks apart as the party are forced to flee for their lives against the rising of a creature they can barely fathom. _______________________________________________________________ ESCAPE The party has no choice but to try to escape as the entire island breaks apart. •  The caves start to collapse as the party move through them, passages closed off or falling away as a great chasm opens beneath them. Every character but one will need to make a DC15 Dexterity Saving Throw to avoid falling rocks. The final character, randomly determined, must make a DC18 Saving Throw as the floor collapses under them. Should any character fail any of these saves, they take 3d6 Bludgeoning damage. As the party escape the caves, they see the massive form of the behemoth rising out of the rock. The peak of the mountain shatters as its rigid, ferocious head lifts and lets out a frightening roar which shakes the land and sea. Even the clouds above part at the sound. The beast resembles a titanic saurian beast, with a hard chin, teeth larger than a Wizard’s tower and two eyes on each side of its head. •  As the mountain breaks, mud and rock washes down its side. Every party member must make another DC15 Dexterity Save to avoid falling debris. Any character caught takes 1d8+2 Bludgeoning damage, and in the effort to find their footing suffers one level of Exhaustion. •  As the party reach the edge of the woodland which once ringed the mountain, they discover the terrain fracturing , rising in places and falling beneath the sea in others. The vessel the party used to reach shore is no longer where it was, and floats freely away from the land. Points of interest: •  The island is populated by numerous medium sized mammals – mainly boar and large wild cats, as well as rodents and common sea birds. •  Most of the island is open, with a few gatherings of oak trees and wild bushes, interspersed with a variety of common and rare flowers. •  Berries and nuts are common, as is a fungus known to be useful as a bonding agent for spell potions. DC15 Nature: This intake and expelling of breath could be a result of a volcanic air-flow. Drawing the attention of the party, a small piece of metal glitters at the base of the wall. It is a fine golden coin with a distinctive arcane crest upon it. This is one of the coins required for the PIECES OF EIGHT quest. DC15 Investigation: Something goes wrong regardless. Investigating the rock wall successfully gives a character a few seconds warning, as they realize that the surface is moving very slightly, and seems almost organic. 16 As the party find their way back on board the ship, they turn one final time and see the large, spike- spined monster rise up on the shattered fragments of the island. It lets out another bellow which pulses out of the area, strong enough to force the party’s ship away. With that final cry it turns and dives into the water, submerging to the deepest depths. The ripples of its impact on the water push the ship further away and then slowly subside, leaving only a few small rocks suggesting where a mountainous island used to be. ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t If the party used a landing boat to reach the island, this boat now floats freely away from shore and be reached by swimming to it with a DC18 Athletics Check. The party may only have one vessel which they brought to the shore itself, or used some other magical form of travel to reach the island from their ship. In these cases, their ship is also offshore and can be reached with the same check. Should any characters remain on shore whilst others reach the ship to bring it to them on the shore, the characters on the shore must struggle to retain their footing and avoid falling rocks. They must make either a DC15 Survival Check or Constitution Save to survive the breaking of the land. 17 Large, tropical land mass comes into view on the horizon, and as the party approach they see a single large hill with a flattened top. Amongst dense foliage they catch sight of man-made structures – a set of ruins hidden amongst the trees which might hold long lost secrets. As they come nearer the spot, a distinct artificial structure sitting at the highest point of the large hill, partially concealed by dense foliage. Getting to it will clearly be an arduous trek. There is very little in terms of shoreline, sharp rocky edges forming the break between land and sea. There are enough fissures and cracks for the party to climb the ten or so feet however, and find themselves standing on the edge of the tree line. _____________________________________________ After climbing up on the surface of the island, the party are at once met with dense plant-life and continuous noise from what they presume to be wildlife hiding amongst the brush. Making their way through will be long and difficult, requiring skill, persistence and the strength to endure. A character, on behalf of the party, will need to make a check to lead them through to reach the large hill at the centre of the island. A skilled walker of woodlands can find paths through the jungle with a DC18 Survival Check. This would be the fastest method, bringing the party to the base of the hill within an hour. A nimble and light footed character could try to find ways over the most dangerous areas with a DC18 Athletics Check, or an impatient character can start hacking their way through, blazing a trail for the rest of the party with a DC20 Strength Check. These two 6. The Ruins Of Ultrek ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t methods take longer however, as not every member of the party will be able to assist and might take longer to follow behind the leader. As such, the party will reach the base of the hill after two hours. _____________________________________________ DC16 Perception: Halfway through the jungle, between the rocky shore and the bade of the hill, a party member who passes this skill check spies something artificial hidden amongst the growth. It appears at a distance to be a stone monolith with carvings on its surface. Roughly 8ft tall, it’s details are obscured by moss and vines. If the party investigates further and remove the obstructions, they find that it is an 8ft tall totem bearing a squared stone carving of a skull at its top. The column below is divided into three sections, each carefully carved upon intricate decorations which could be a language. Points of interest: •  The island is very tropical. A dense forest of large-leaved trees cover the entire surface, the trees coming up from cracks in the ground. A DC15 Nature check can indicate that the island may once have been volcanic in ancient history, resulting in fertile ground for these trees to grow. •  A large number of insects make their home here, some of whom vary in poisonous and toxicity. There are also a variety of snakes making their home in the rocks beneath the surface, and a small number of large birds living in the higher trees. •  The island is extremely fertile ground for many plants, herbs and berries common in simple healing poultices and some poisons. A DC20 Nature check can help a character to search thoroughly towards the top of the hill to find a single example of a rare plant which can be used to make a superior healing poultice. As the party make their way through, there is a 50% chance that a random player will find themselves bitten by a poisonous/venomous (snake, spider, etc) which has managed to make it way towards them unseen. The character takes 1 hit point of damage, and must make a DC15 Constitution Saving Throw or else be Poisoned until they can find appropriate healing. The language on the totem is old and unique, and not one likely to be regularly known by party members. However should they use other non- mundane methods to translate it (such as using magic), then they can discover that it roughly reads as follows. TOTEM “This is a holy place to be walked on only by the chosen people.” “Cursed and doomed are they who walk here without the blessing.” “Walk safe the holy people, whose time will surely come.” 18 THE BASE OF THE HILL With a final effort the party reach the base of the hill, and find themselves at the bottom of a large overgrown but still visible stone stair which leads up the rock. Each step is finely made from a yellowed marble, with patterns carved into their surface. Above the party see a sheer rocky climb littered with broken rock and more foliage piercing the surface of the stone. Whichever route the party use, it will take at least two hours to rise to the top of the hill, where the party again find themselves confronted by an extremely dense tree line, however this one is far denser than before. The party can just about see through the tightly packed trees and see a clearing at their centre with a flat stone floor standing before a stone structure, though there is too much obstruction to make it out clearly. There does seem to be an opening on its front though, facing the flat stone courtyard. As characters make their way into the stone courtyard, they find themselves standing in a large square space with an 8ft totem in each corner identical to those party may have seen hidden in the temple. At the eastern edge of the courtyard, a set of broken steps rise up to a small stone temple which rises up above the tree line like a tower, though the design is very simple. Standing roughly 50ft high, the sides are smooth stone, a yellowed marble identical to every other man-made structure (stairs, totems and the courtyard) on this island. The flat stone is broken by a recessed ring every 10ft, and adorned with occasional carved skulls similar to those seen on the totems. The floor of the courtyard is decorated with a single large engraving of a squared, but somehow still humanoid skull. ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t DC15 Nature: The density of the trees blocking their path at this point is unnatural high, suggesting that they may have been placed, or that their growth has been supernaturally encouraged. The party must find their own way through the trees and onto the courtyard. The trees are quite tight together, preventing any character of size Medium or higher from squeezing through. Anyone smaller can just about force their way through though providing they are not wearing heavy armour. If attacked, each tree has an AC of 16 and 30 hit points. If set on fire, the flames will spread through the entire hill-top jungle (but not the floor level trees). Such a fire will burn hot and bright, and will stay that way for a very long time, lasting well into the coming night and still smolder in the morning. THE TEMPLE As any character make a move towards the temple, as soon as they step foot on the first stop (or approach the opening) they are alerted to a deep growling from inside the structure. Guttural and filled with rage, the noise pouts them on alert at once, as a large, black feline steps out of the darkness and glares at them with the eyes of a hungry predator. † Cougars (see page 29) ______________________________________________________________ The Cougars who attack are the defenders of the temple, and seem to be empowered by elemental energies. As they attack, the party can easily notice that their strikes are infused with either the power of Air, Earth, Fire or Water. The Air Cougar seems weightless and almost ethereal, the Earth Cougar more solid and blocky than a cat such as this should be. The Fire Cougar has fur which seems to ripple and writhe like flames, and finally the Water Cougar seems to act in a semi-fluid state. ______________________________________________________________ Once the defenders are defeated, the party can explore within and find more of the ancient writing inside. The entire tower is a single chamber roughly 40ft wide, its roof reaching far up to the very top of the building. Every wall is adorned with carving and writing which exalt the gods of the elements, the four powerful beings it seems the builders of this place once worshipped. At the centre of the room there is a small podium only 3ft tall, its sides covered in the same writing but its top appearing to house moving parts at the top of a hidden mechanism. A DC16 Investigation Check reveals a latch which releases a stone ‘T’ shaped plunging switch. Pressing it down sets in motion a series of clicks and what sounds like machinery turning, but then they stop, and nothing happens. 19 As the switch is depressed, a series of clicks become louder clangs, and large stone can be heard and felt shifting below the ground. An extremely loud grinding suddenly becomes apparent as the engraved skull which dominates the centre of the courtyard slowly descends into the floor, and then splits at four points. Each segment is pulled back towards one of the four corners, revealing underneath a mass grave filled with humanoid skeletal remains, all carefully arranged so that from the angle of the temple they resembled the same stone skull as was above them. DC16 Medicine: the position of the bones gives a stark image, but it is undeniable that these people were ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t An investigation of the area outside will reveal something interesting about the four totems at the corners of the courtyard which links to this mechanism. Each has the same writing on it as the totem found in the jungle below the hill, however they also feature a single additional character unique to each individual totem. Magically being able to read the language will make the process easier, but a DC18 Investigation Check can help a character to draw links between these symbols and those within the temple. By comparing icons, they discern that each totem is linked to one of the four primal elements. ____________________________________________________________ From here, the characters must activate each totem in turn by exposing it to the element it is linked to. A burst of air for Air, contact with dirt for Earth, a source of fire for Fire, and moisture for Water. As each is activated, it begins to glow and hum, each getting brighter and louder as others are activated. Once all four are activated, the switch in the temple will work. The switch will also unlatch itself and be revealed if it hasn’t been already.) alive when they were placed here. The careful arrangement is too precise and has decayed in just such a way as to suggest that these people lay here, arranged, of their own free will as a sacrifice to their gods. _____________________________________________________________ At the centre of the arrangement, the party spy a stone casket, a circular chest roughly 4ft in diameter. The lid lifts with a little effort, and inside the party find one more humanoid skeleton, adorned with jewelry. Possibly a leader or shaman of the group laid out around them, this form is placed in his finery at the centre of the display. Upon the remains the party find a headpiece, necklace and belt buckle, all made of gold with a rough value of 50gp per party member. In the clenched, skeletal hand of the entombed leader, the party also find a fine golden coin with a distinctive arcane crest upon it. This is one of the coins required for the PIECES OF EIGHT quest. 20 The party’s vessel emerges from a dense, claustrophobic fog to catch sight of an island immediately ahead, barely half a mile away to the east. They steer sharply and pull in the sails to prevent themselves from driving straight into the beach ahead, and drop anchor just off the western edge of the island. The island seems pleasant enough, with tropical trees and a mountainous region in its centre, and possibly a lagoon on its southern side. As they inspect it from offshore and consider landing though, they catch sight of an Elven woman standing on the beach. She drops a basic containing some kind of fruit and cheers with unimaginable joy before she turns and runs into the trees behind her, shouting something which can’t be made out from this distance. ______________________________________________________________ THE CREW OF THE MINNOW As the party come ashore, they pass through some scraps of wooden wreckage. It looks very much like the remains of a ship’s hull. The reach land and are once met by six humanoid figures who emerge from the trees, massive grins on their faces. They are first approached by a large, stocky Human male who introduces himself as Jonas. Jonas goes on to explain that he was the Captain of a ship called the Minnow, which crashed on this island after emerging from thick fog nearly twelve years ago. He and the five others with him are the last survivors of that dreadful wreck. 7. The Fate Of The Minnow ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t Jonas introduces the other survivors: •  Gill, the first mate, is a short, thin and possibly malnourished Elven male who speaks extremely nervously. •  Howell, a human male who introduces himself as a merchant, and promises great monetary rewards in return for his rescue. •  Went, the human female wife of Howell. •  Grant, a young (even by Elven standards) elven female performer of some kind. •  Mary, a Halfling female who appears to be dressed for cooking (in an apron). He says there was a seventh until recently, a Wizard by the name of Hinkley, but he as a human had succumbed to age just a month too soon for rescue. ______________________________________________________________ Through promises of reward and appeals to common kindness, the survivors will seek affirmation from the party that they can be rescued. They have supplies enough for a voyage if that is what it takes, and on receiving the news that they can come with the party, the whole group will start to celebrate. They will insist on packing their things, and celebrating their good fortune after twelve years trapped on this island. They will lead the party inland to a settlement they’ve built around an inlet of water. The party will at once recognize pieces of a ship used to make their huts, which will explain where the rest of the ship went. Points of interest: •  This is a tropical island with several fruit and berry giving plants littered across its surface. The inhabitants have built several structures to mimic their lives back home and attempted rudimentary agriculture. •  Domestic animals of all sorts make them homes here, some having been raised form those who were onboard the Minnow. JONAS “By the gods I never thought I would live to see this day! People! Real life other people! Rescue! Surely we are saved!” “Glorious heroes, surely sent to us by the gods, please, please say that you’ll take us away from this place! For so long we have waited for some sign of hope! Please say you are that!” A character with a nautical background or a propensity for speaking to sailors (or who has recently gathered rumours from sailors) may have heard of the Minnow. It was a passenger vessel, lost as Jonas says nearly twelve years ago. It was said to have been chartered for passage over the sea, but never arrived. It was presumed lost with all hands. As the party heads towards the settlement, a rough walking order should be worked out as the survivors intermingle with the party. Whichever party member is nearest Gill will stub their toe as they walk through the woods. 21 The survivors are happy to talk the party through a tour of the island as they pack what they have, apparently having been able to save their personal effects from the ship after the crash. •  The nearby mountain they say is an extinct volcano, and they consider it bad luck to go there. •  To the north of the settlement is a hut they painted green. This is where they keep much of their supplies. •  On the south-western corner is a patch of land where Howell has apparently created a small golf course. •  A cave close to the settlement contains a vein of gold ore, which for a time they celebrated because they thought themselves rich, until they remembered they could never spend it. They care little for it now, and it is worth approximately 100gp. •  On the south-east corner there is a beach with a large patch of quicksand. •  In the north-east corner, they say that there are two turtles who have been racing for twelve years. ______________________________________________________________ ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t Whilst the survivors are busy packing, they offer food and drink to the party (including a fairly foul home brewed moonshine). It becomes apparent though that there is one hut nobody enters, and which nobody seems to currently live in. The survivors explain that this is the one that belonged to Hinkley, the old Wizard who was once a part of their group. Inside are a number of odd contraptions similar to those that might be found in an alchemists lab, but of poor hand-made quality. There is no spellbook, as might be assumed for a Wizard, as the other survivors say that Hinkley asked them to burn it upon his death. They had no ideas on the ways of Wizards, so did as he asked without question. One of the odd contraptions catches the eye of a party member. It seems to be a glass orb, perhaps once a fish bowl. DC 16 Arcana: It appears to be an attempt at creating a Scrying Orb. What is of interest though is the power source. Wires leading out from the globe end in clamps which hold in place a fine golden coin with a distinctive arcane crest upon it. This is one of the coins required for the PIECES OF EIGHT quest. 22 Once everyone has finished packing the chests and bags they have available, they will turn enthusiastically towards the beach where they first greeted the party. Gill however will say that they have some food in their supply hut to the north, and asks for help in collecting it for the voyage home. Its not too far, and his bags are being carried by another survivor so one or two party members would be extremely useful in retrieving the crates. Gill leads any volunteers to the small hut. It is plain and simple, and hidden behind several large leaves. Inside are three crates filled with fruits and meats, well preserved and wrapped in leaves. As they turn to leave however, a gorilla will leap out from behind the hut and attack Gill. † Giant Ape (CR7, MM323) The Gorilla will focus its attention on Gill who will try to escape at every chance he has. But the creature will be more a nuisance than anything else to the party, and will flee into the trees when attacked. After, Gill will claim that the damned Gorilla has it in for him, and has attacked before. He will resume trying to recover the supplies. _______________________________________________________________ ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t As the assembled group reach the ship, more calamity will strike and with greater force. As Gill first sets foot on the deck, a nearby rope will come undone from its housing at the side of the ship, requiring first a DC16 Athletics or Acrobatics Check to catch the flailing rope as it swings in the increasingly strong wing, but then a DC18 Strength Check to tie it back into place. Looking out to sea, the party will also see the same dense fog they came through to reach this island starting to move in their direction, obscuring their view of both island and the open sea. As efforts are then made to raise the anchor, a loud crack will sound out and the ship will lurch slightly to the side. Investigating below deck, the party will realize that their hull has been pierced. A 2ft crack in the side of the ship’s prow is now taking on water. And will be a serious problem if it can’t be fixed. During the packing and investigation of the Wizard’s hut, there should be a small number of clumsy “accidents” all in the vicinity of Gill. A piece of roofing falling in for example, or Gill himself tripping and spilling the drink he was trying to offer onto a party member. At each point the party should be inconvenienced, but not harmed. GILL! If the party are in serious trouble with this leak and have no means of fixing it themselves (and no better ideas), the elven performer Grant can chime in to say that she has limited Bardic skills, and knows a Mending Cantrip. This will not fix the hole straight away, but sustained effort and the help of other party members in trying to close the hole will eventually lead to the tear being sealed. By now a pattern of behavior might be becoming evident to the party. Gill is supernaturally unlucky, and attracts danger and calamity wherever he goes though he has absolutely no knowledge of this (and neither do the rest of the crew, who just think that he’s clumsy). This however is more than likely the reason the Minnow crashed. On the way back to the ship, more disasters will occur and actually become more frequent. They will also affect the party members who are with Gill. •  A tree branch will fall, dealing 1hp damage to a random character. •  The bottom will fall out of a random food crate, spilling its contents on the ground. Gill will want to stop to recover the food. •  As Gill arrives at the beach where everyone is preparing to set off, the tide will suddenly and violently start to come in unexpectedly. This will cause a scramble amongst the survivors to get onto the ship by whatever means the party have available (raft, magic, etc,). •  The phrase “oh no, not again” will be common amongst other survivors. 23 The party have a brief respite after this in order to deal with the problem and get underway, putting the island behind them. _______________________________________________________________ THE STORM Should the party resume with their rescue efforts, the fog will clear after roughly half an hour, but to worse conditions. The sky now darkens and the seas get choppier as a violent storm descends on the ship. The party will be within the storm for at least two to three hours. During this time, sailing will be extremely difficult, and other hazards will come into play. •  DC18 Survival: A character must first try to interpret the storm, and find a better path through it. If they succeed, all party members gain +1 to further rolls in the storm. •  DC18 Athletics: As the storm intensifies, a rogue wave washes over the deck. The party and passengers must hold on to avoid being washed overboard! •  DC22 Strength Save: The character manning the helm needs to keep a firm grip on the wheel as the ship rises and falls down mighty waves. If they succeed, all party members gain +1 on further rolls ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t in the storm. •  The cracked hull will split open again, requiring the party’s attention to fix it. Otherwise it will widen, and supplies from below deck will be lost. •  The main sail detaches at one point along its top. A character must climb up with a DC20 Athletics Check to reattach it and keep moving. •  DC20 Perception Test: Advantage for any character who in the rigging or up a mast. If a character passes, they spy a clearing ahead and can guide the ship towards it and out of the storm. If nobody passes, repeat one of the other events above (or create your own). _____________________________________________________________ When the ship finally passes the storm, the seas become calm and the sun shines again. The ship is damaged and will need some serious repairs once it finds its way back to a safe harbour, but the worst is over. The party have defeated Gill’s curse and can now sail on. The Minnow survivors (those who survive) are grateful and finally at peace now that they are away from the island and in calm waters. When the party next makes dock they are thankful and depart to try to find the remnants of their old lives. Howell gives them an address, his old family home, in a city further inland, and tells the party that if they ever need his aid or some gold, they are simply to come and ask for it. Gill’s misfortune is obviously the source of these disasters, though he is not himself doing anything wrong. However the party may well realize that he is at the centre of it and want him off their ship before any more serious damage is done. It is worth noting though that should he be left behind, these disasters will stop and the party will be safe from further harm. The other survivors however will not want to leave him behind. If Gill stays on the island, they will elect to stay with him (if they have the choice). If Gill is attacked in any way as well, they will try to protect him. † Commoner (CR0, MM345) *Grant, as a Bard, will have access to Bard Cantrips Matters need not come to violence, but this option is available at the party’s discretion. DC16 Arcana or Religion: To a character with Religious or Arcane knowledge, it seems that Gill’s misfortune could well be a result of a curse from a more powerful being, quite likely a god or higher demon. As such the only courses of action available are to push through and confront it, or live with it. To make things interesting, a random Minnow survivor (EXCEPT Gill) should be washed overboard, prompting the party to attempt to rescue them by whatever means they can. 24 A distance shape comes into view, and as the party get nearer it is revealed to be a sail, and beneath that a small ship anchored out in the middle of nowhere. On approach the party hearing someone shouting to them from the other vessel, and waving a light in the air to catch their attention (a sunrod). A small, rotund Human man calls to them and asks to come onboard. He desperately need their help. With the consent of the party, the small vessel comes alongside, and the man comes onboard. A short Human, easily mistaken for a Dwarf beneath his bushy, ginger moustache, he wears extremely fine clothing which singles him out as a man of taste and resources. He introduces himself as Silas Cole, a successful merchant. Should the party agree, Silas will be elated. From a pouch on his side he will withdraw a scroll, upon which is the spell Water Breathing. 8. The Colossus ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t With their consent, Silas will read the scroll and cast it on the party, allowing them to descend into the depths without fear of drowning. He also gives the party a further scroll of Water Breathing, to aid in rescuing Willas, and then wishes the party luck as they dive overboard. _______________________________________________________________ The waters start clear and pristine, but quickly give way to claustrophobic darkness as the party descend into the sea. Sparkling light far above reminds them of where the surface is, but as that goes out of sight the party find themselves guided only by gravity and their light sources. Schools of fish swim by, and the occasional singular submarine life-form will pass at some distance, keeping clear of the party as they intrude. The first sign the party see is after some time. Looming out of the darkness, the character leading the way spies a flat surface, possibly a dome of some kind beneath. At first it seems to be stone, but on closer inspection is actually identified as bronze. The seabed is still some way down, so as the party pass the structure they discern more details and discover it to be a colossal bronze head. In the little light they have available, the party can make out elven features on the gigantic face which peers out at them from the darkness with blank eyes in a serene expression. _______________________________________________________________ As the party descend further down, they get a better view of the entire structure and the seabed coming up below. The sight they find is that of a broken, sunken city of stone, the architecture of an ancient Elven design. Crushed halls and toppled towers litter an area roughly a mile across, and at its centre, still standing tall, the grand colossus which first greeted the party on their descent – a 1000ft tall bronze statue of an elven warrior in finely carved armour. _______________________________________________________________ THE CITY The vast majority of the city is broken and decayed from long years at the bottom of the sea. DC16 History: much of the design and architectural aesthetic puts the character in mind of Elven designs from about 1500 years ago. Many hallmark features are still used by modern Elves (leaf and other natural themed motifs). There is a legend of a coastal city that was lost, superstition suggesting that it had SILAS COLE “Greetings kind people, I am Silas Cole. Merchant. A finder of lost things. As it were.” “it is good fortune that you came by here today, for calamity has struck me and I am at a loss for what to do. I need your aid!” “I came out here with my brother Willas to conduct some….salvage. There are treasures right below our feet, which we sought to make a pretty penny on let me tell you. But the spell! The spell which allowed him to breath beneath the water will have worn off by now, yet he hasn’t returned!” “Please! I have more of the spell! I will split what treasure he found down there.....60/40?” Though his instincts as a merchant give him ground to start negotiating on splitting the treasure, he is ultimately more concerned with his brother. He will haggle for some time, but will finally settle for any price which sees the party descend into the waters to rescue his brother. If the party ask, Silas describes the treasure as the finery of an ancient civilization. Art, gold and jewels. In case the party have no means of generating light for themselves, Silas will also reluctantly hand over the sunrod he was using to attract them, though only if asked for it. 25 grown decadent and being destroyed by the gods as a result. DC16 Investigation: What remains has been covered over with sea life and weeds, but in amongst the wreckage players can find a few examples of ancient art, including jars, weapons (non-magical) and other ceramics or metals. Even a few coins. The party are able to gather artifacts worth roughly 100gp per party member +2 (600 for four, 400 for 2, etc,). DC16 Perception: From the pattern of the city’s layout and the geography of the sea bed, it looks very much like the city stood on a large ridge which fell into the sea. There is enough rock to suggest that a chunk of landmass simply broke away and slipped into the water, possibly because of an earthquake or volcanic eruption. DC20 Perception: Should a character roll high enough on their Perception check, they are also momentarily alerted to a moving figure out in the darkness of the water. Briefly they think they see something move, but then it disappears when they look towards it. _______________________________________________________________ THE STATUE DC16 History: the armoured figure is representative of ancient elven armour designs, the crests on its chest suggesting a noble born general. Clearly a design based on a person, and not a god or concept. DC16 Investigation: The statue has not survived wholly intact. Though it stand stands tall, there are dent and marks, and also a hole in its leg leading into a dark, hollow interior. _______________________________________________________________ INSIDE THE STATUE A hole in the statute’s right leg leads to a hollow interior, partially filled with water but not entirely. Within, the party find a ladder leading up the leg which leads them up to a pocket of air at roughly the figure’s hip. The ladder ends at a metal walkway crossing over the interior of the waist, further ladders leading up to more walkways above. On the waist walkway however, the party discover a body, humanoid and very fresh, dressed in simple swimming gear but of a fine design similar to Silas’, worn by a tall, thin man whose features undeniably mark him as the merchant’s brother. As a character moves to investigate him though, he jumps into life, holding a bright sunrod directly in the face of his examiner and panting as he backs against the far wall, frightened out of his mind. ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t Some effort can be made to calm him and to convince the man that the party are not there to harm him (or, of course, the party can just harm him and render him unconscious). Should they succeed at speaking though, Willas will calm a little and praise their rescue efforts. He will speak with fear though, of how he came to be trapped here. He dove into the Colossus he claims, because while he was searching the ruins a monster had come – some great beast of the depths looming out of the darkness and coming for him. Triggered Event – FERAL HEARTS •  As soon as the first conversation with Willas Cole ends, and the party decide to move out. As the party swim out into the sea, preparing to ascend and leave this place, a dark figure will loom on the horizon. It will at first seem to pass by with disturbing speed, but then swing back and pass again from a distance. DC16 Nature: The behavior puts one in mind of a predator making passes over their target, assessing it before making their first strike. As the party make their move either to escape or take up defensive positions, it will disappear into the dark waters, and then suddenly come at the head one, mouth open and ready to feast. † The Sea Beast (see page 29) Amongst the treasures the party will also find a fine golden coin with a distinctive arcane crest upon it. This is one of the coins required for the PIECES OF EIGHT quest. WILLAS COLE “Back! Back you devils of the deep! You’ll not have me! You’ll not have my life!” WILLAS COLE “Like a spectre of death it was. Frightful. I could not see it fully in the dark, but it was a monstrous sight what little I did see.” “Huge it was. A leviathan of ancient days I would call it!” This is a monster which will soon make its presence felt, however its exact description in the words of Willas Cole has been left vague. This is because in order to scale the encounter for different levels of party, a few different creatures have been suggested in the Creatures Stats Reference later in this module. As such, you should feel free to elaborate further on Willas’ description of the creature based on whatever monster the party are actually going to face. If the entire party entered the Colossus, then this event will trigger as they emerge from the hole in its leg (or any other exit they are able to make for themselves. If some party members are still outside at this point however, then the event will trigger on them first. 26 The Sea Beast can be defeated, or the party can choose to flee the monster altogether, deciding that the rescue of Willas (and perhaps the retrieval of what treasure they have) is more important than fighting. Whatever the party decides, the Sea Beast will chase them for a time and attack them when it can, but will stop pursuing the party as they approach the surface, perhaps attacking one final time when the party break the surface of the water and then retreating back into the depths. As the party emerge from the water, Silas will call out to them, throwing down ladders and ropes so that they can climb onto either ship. He will offer his hand to anyone who climbs, making it easier to get back onto a solid deck. ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t Note that being underwater, this encounter can be extremely difficult. Although the encounters given are judged to be Medium level encounters, they are made much harder by the party being underwater where: •  Creatures which do not have natural swimming speeds are at disadvantage on Melee attacks, unless using s dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear or trident. •  Ranged attacks automatically miss beyond normal range, and the attack roll is at disadvantage unless using a crossbow, net, or a thrown weapon. •  Creatures fully submerged have resistance to Fire damage. •  Although they can breathe when under the effects of a Water Breathing spell, spellcasters can not talk so can not use spells with a verbal component unless they can find some way to surround themselves with regular air. If the party have rescued Willas, then Silas will be overjoyed and shout their praises as they climb onboard. Once on the deck of a ship, Willas will also be extremely grateful, adding his own pouch of 200gp to any treasure the party were able to salvage for themselves. If Willas is not rescued, Silas will be frantic at first, looking out for him and asking where he has gone, and whether he was found. Silas will move back and forth along the deck, looking over the side expecting to see his brother emerge from the depths. Upon hearing that Willas is not coming back, Silas will drop into a deep depression, immediately say his farewells and depart without any care for treasure. If it was not found by a party member during their investigation of the sunken city, Willas will also offer over a fine golden coin with a distinctive arcane crest upon it which he found. This is one of the coins required for the PIECES OF EIGHT quest. The city is still a trove of further treasure which can be recovered with effort, but a LOT of effort is required. Assuming the monster can be defeated at some point in the future, exploring the city, properly mapping it and recovering its treasures is a large undertaking which would require archaeological professionals. If the party do wish to pursue this, it should be stressed that it is not a task they can accomplish simply by weighing anchor here and diving occasionally. They will need to conduct a decent, organized study and search of the area to find anything of real value which would make the effort worth it. 27 Appendix 1: Creature Statistics Reference ISLAND ADVENTURES: THE PIECES OF EIGHT by Stephen Bull Not\tfor\tresale.\tPermission\tgranted\tto\tprint\tor\tphotocopy\tthis\tdocument\tfor\tpersonal\tuse\tonly\t Here you will find references for every combat encounter referred to in this adventure pack, with primary suggestions for creature encounters suitable for different levels of player parties.
