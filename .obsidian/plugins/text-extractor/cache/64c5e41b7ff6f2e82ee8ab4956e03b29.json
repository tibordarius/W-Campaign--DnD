{"path":"Whale campaign/A Structure/Reference and Rules/2519797-Fishing.pdf","text":"Fishing For Knucklehead Trout T his is a guide for catching knucklehead trout in the campaign, Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden. This guide is adapted to include the possibility of catching prize fish as well as average (or below-average) fish. Just to spice things up a little bit. How it works After fishing for 1 hour, characters must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. A failed check indicates no fish is caught during that hour. If the check succeeds, roll on the Type of Fish table to determine what fish the characters have hooked, and then consult with the Fish Strength table to determine the DC for successfully catching the fish. Characters who fail the Strength (Athletics) check by 5 or more must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be pulled into the frigid water.

Here is the approximate value of each fish. Fish Value Type of Fish Reward Baby Trout 1 cp Average Female 3 cp Average Male 5 cp Prize Female 1 sp Prize Male 1 gp Frigid Water Rules A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water. Because the average temperature of Icewind Dale is -49 degrees Fahrenheit, a character who is pulled out of the water continues to suffer the effects of the frigid water until the wet clothes are taken off and replaced with dry ones. King Knucklehead Catching a prize fish and living to tell the tale is a once-in-a- lifetime achievement for most residents of Ten-Towns. The first player who catches five prize Knucklehead Trout will be granted the title of King Knucklehead, and his or her fame will spread quickly throughout the region. As a reward for this accomplishment, that player will be in good standing with any resident of Ten-Towns whom they have not already made enemies with (except perhaps for those NPCs whose aims are directly against the players'). This player will not be charged for food or drink at any local taverns (although his or her companions will not receive the same luxury). As a DM, you may decide whether this title carries further advantages for certain in-game mechanics. Perhaps this character will receive an enchanted fishing rod (one that pairs well with the Hook of Fisher's Delight) that lowers the DC of finding or catching fish, that grants advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to catch fish, or that increases the chance of finding larger fish. Perhaps the character gains advantage on all Charisma checks made to interact with the people of Ten-Towns. Perhaps the character is given a crown and scepter and made the High Lord of All Ten-Towns. Or not. Use your best judgement. Overall, this just seems like a fun regional reward for one of the players at the table snd adds some depth and role-playing opportunities to an otherwise (mostly) unrewarding part of the campaign setting.
