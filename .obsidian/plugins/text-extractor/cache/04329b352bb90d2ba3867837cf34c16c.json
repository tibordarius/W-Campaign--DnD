For sea life, it is an idyll - marine flora and fauna flourish, sheltered from the strong ocean currents. Rival fishing fleets battle for the shellfish that inhabit these shallow waters. But beneath the waves that wash against the mysteriously engraved Raven's Peaks, strange beasts lurk and elemental forces are imprisoned and shipwrecks wait to be plundered.

Cheers, Richard, Katrine and Davis The Raven's Rocks Raven’s Rocks is a shallow reef situated several miles from the coast. A contested ground among local fishermen; the area is well renowned for the sumptuous oysters and other shellfish that dwell in numbers around the rocks - much loved by wildlife such as otters, seals and a variety of seabirds. Situated four miles out to sea, Raven’s Rocks are exposed to some of the worst elements of nautical weather. In the Autumn and Winter months savage storms wrack the ragged rocks, the raging sea washing over all but the highest outcrop. In the Summer, the waters here are placid and this is the time when the fishermen reap the oyster harvest. Its name is derived from a series of mysterious rock carvings that can be found in the caves on the largest rock. These caves are occasionally inhabited, however, it is what lies in the depths that also makes the area intriguing to treasure hunters. DM’s Note: This area has been designed for use with Ghosts of Saltmarsh. It should be situated a number of miles off the coast. However, it can also be used in almost any fantasy campaign setting, with the rocks being situated any suitable distance off the coastline where it would take a couple of hours to sail to. 3 Not for resale.

Locations Raven's Peak The highest rocky outcrop, standing 60ft above sea level, is called Raven’s Peak due to the rock carvings that can be found in two small caves close to the summit. These caves have sheltered wrecked sailors for centuries and are full of graffiti and flotsam fires. Sometimes angry captains dump stowaways who can’t pay their voyage fee here. The caves themselves are no more than 30ft deep, but there are several small cracks that lead to greater hollowed out places. Several thousand years ago, when the sea-levels were lower, this was a place of worship for early hominids. Evidence of their ritualistic behaviour can be found here, if one can tunnel through the cave-ins into those larger, hidden caverns. Large numbers of simple paintings and carvings of ravens can be found, along with preserved tools and bones. 4 Not for resale.

Hidden Sea Cave In a trench hidden by the swirling swathes of kelp, there is underwater cave around the entrance of which are carved many ancient runes. It is here that a being of unprecedented evil was entombed, a Water Elemental Prince, that centuries ago wreaked ruin upon the merfolk population. It was eventually defeated in battle and imprisoned within a statue of a wave deep in this cave. Guarding it are two Water Weirds, they lair in this cave fulfilling their eternal duty. The Kelp Garden This underwater area near Raven’s Rock is one of the best for collecting scallops, another sea delicacy that the fishermen come here for. Unfortunately, the best method is to skin dive in the chilly waters for them. This is not without its dangers, giant octopuses swim casually here. It is also home to a number of shipwrecks, many of which lay untouched on the sandy bottom, encrusted by mussels and barnacles. Gregor's Folly Due north of the Raven’s Peak is a low lying reef, which is notoriously treacherous in strong winds and at the times of year when the current runs fast over the teeth like rocks. Many a vessel has broken itself here, being pushed and pulled into a watery grave. The seafloor is littered with shipwrecks. There are a number of masts and sterns acting as a warning foolhardy captains who think they can navigate this area. The Wreck of the Siren Hidden in a trench not too far from Gregor’s Folly is the wreck of what once was a magnificent trading vessel - a hundred years ago one of the finest on the seas. In stormy weather the vessels sails were ripped asunder and it ploughed on to the reef. The Siren foundered, and its heavy, precious cargo shifted under the brutal conditions, causing it to capsize. It settled on the sea bed upside down and eventually became home to a Morkoth. This deadly denizen of the deep often has one or two hypnotized Merrow around for defense and/or food. It has stored all the ship’s treasure in one area of the hold and is quite aware of its attraction to treasure seeking glory hunters. 5 Not for resale.

Personalities and Interested Parties The Fishermen Two crews regularly compete in this area for dominance of the oyster beds. Both crew captains control a number of small seagoing vessels to harvest the oyster bounty. They utilize different methods depending on the depth of the water, from short and long pole rakes to skin diving. The latter of these methods is quite dangerous, with some areas having quick, fluctuating currents weaving through kelp beds – this is only a method used by the brave and / or foolhardy. The competition between Skranky Jack and Oliver Cooper is fierce; both have taken great risks to farm the bountiful supply of oysters, taking their crews out in heaving seas to meet the demand. Skranky Jack A wizened old seafarer who owns twelve fishing boats, with a crew of between 70 and 100 men. He has been sailing these seas for 30 years and knows every rock and cove. Generally considered a good hearted, yet grumpy man, he has recently taken a melancholic turn after a serious accident on one of his vessels lost him two close crew members and broke several of his ribs - an injury from which he is taking time to recover. Many of his crew are talking about joining the boats of Oliver Cooper, as the pay is more attractive, despite the risks being higher. Jack is well aware of this, but with his injury, he is incapable of doing anything about it. A newcomer to the oyster fishing industry. His father died several years ago leaving a fleet of dilapidated boats and a few grizzly crew. Oliver sourced funds from some dubious sources, rebuilt the fleet, hired new crew and set his sights on the most profitable sources of income i.e: the oyster beds around Raven’s Rocks during the Summer season. This has put him into direct conflict with Skranky Jack, therefore he has taken measures to reduce Jack’s ability to fish these waters. He has recently struck a deal with the group of Merrow that has staked its claim to the area around Raven’s Rocks. Oliver Cooper 6 Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. Oliver could easily be described as ruthless and greedy. He is driven by a need to supersede his deceased father and show the world how better a man Oliver is. However, the allies he has chosen will soon be demanding their loaned money back, with profit. He will be driven to more desperate measures to ensure his plans success. DM Note: Oliver’s secretive backers could be any large evil organisation in your world. A good fit for the Forgotten Realms would be the Zhentarim. Merrow Very recently, a member of Skranky Jack’s crew swam through a kelp bed and found the corpse of a sailor tied to undulating weed. It seems a group of Merrow – evil merfolk, have moved into the area and marked it as their territory. How this will affect the balance of power remains to be seen. The Merrow are led by a particularly aggressive and brutal male called Shrxyxeckeziz, his fins are tipped with poisoned sea urchin quills, which he slashes at his opponents with in combat. Oliver has offered it many land dwellers for sacrifice to their dark and slimy deity. 7 Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. Adventure Hooks Here are a number of useful adventure hooks for your game. They utilize the NPCs and locations provided in this module, but they can be modified for use elsewhere. Each of these adventures can be started in a tavern or by having an NPC request the adventurers aid outright. Sabotage In a grim tavern close to the docks, a scruffy, bearded man in an old oil skin approaches the adventurers and offers them a job proposition. Oliver wants to sabotage Skranky Jack’s fleet somehow. His Merrow allies have provided him with some fast growing and wood eating molluscs to attach to the hulls of the vessels. Now he requires the aid of a third party to do the dirty work. Jack, on the other hand, has recently hired a group of nice gentlemen from a mercenary company who are guarding his pontoons and vessels. They number several spell casters and warriors, and have orders to disable any intruders. Crew my ship Skranky Jack needs some new crew, rather specifically, he needs some strong armed daring doers who aren’t above swinging some weapons and slinging spells. One of hs smaller vessels was found floating without crew, blood was splattered over the gunnels and oars. He wants to send another boat to the area above the Kelp Forest, except this time the crew will be able to defend itself. Skranky’s fishing boat was attacked by the Merrow who were forewarned of its coming by Oliver Cooper. He offered them sacrifices, and he delivered on that promise. He will notify them as soon the adventurers take to the sea. Treasure Hunt Monty Younger, the son of a local landowner who has recently deceased, has come into his inheritance and unfortunately, it isn’t very much. His family’s historical fortune was tied up in a great mercantile venture which, unfortunately, sank into the waves onboard the Siren, which is now located somewhere near Raven’s Rocks. Monty is willing to sink the last of his family’s riches, some 1,000gp, into finding that shipwreck and obtaining the bullion that is meant to be in its hold. Stranded Sailors A summer storm has wrecked several fishing boats in the Raven’s Rocks region, but the locals are fearful of mounting a rescue due to the severe swells and sightings of a Dire Shark in the area. Who will be brave enough to venture out into the poor conditions to rescue these brave souls? 8 Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. Archaeological Promise A rumour has reached the local historian and archaeologist Sir Valter Ursine that, after a recent storm, a new cave in Raven’s Peak has been found with some startling cave paintings and stone-age finds. He would love to hire some mercenaries to take him out there and protect him whilst he studied these items. However, deep in the caves, the ghosts of those ancient hunter gatherers are restless, they are caught in an eternal conflict with the ghostly predators of their time. If the adventurers and the archaeologist camp in these caves they will find themselves embroiled in this timeless battle overlooking a recently glacially carved valley where herds of mammoths roam. How will they survive? How will they return? 9 Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
