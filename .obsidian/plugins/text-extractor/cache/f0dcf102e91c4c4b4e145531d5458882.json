{"path":"Whale campaign/A Structure/Third Party/Adventures 6+ Hours/2091704-Shipwrecked_on_Furan_Module_01_2nd_Edition.pdf","text":"A Dungeons & Dragons Adventure for 3 to 5 players Written by Alasdair Hill Shipwrecked on Furan This adventure is set on the isolated and seldom known island of Furan, situated 2000 miles West off the Sword Coast. Furan is a large island populated by mainly humans. Its culture is typical to that of medieval Highlands and Islands of Scotland; windswept, frugal and steeped in celtic mythology. The adventure begins with the playing characters waking up in the prison hold of a slavers ship that has found itself in trouble. A grave tempest is swirling around the boat. Ask the players to develop a backstory as to why they might be a target for slavers. Do they have a special ability that someone is willing to pay a handsome price for? Have they caused great suffering to others? Do they have an unusual trait that society finds repulsive? Use these backstories to develop their character but also to lead future adventures from. Ultimately the players may choose to leave the island. Do they go after the slavers? Do they take revenge on the society that sold them? The first module of this campaign sees the players struggle to keep afloat during the tempest, causing them to be shipwrecked on Furan near the fishing village of Bacann. As they seek sanctuary the sounds of a festival drift across the mudflats. All is not as it seems; as the village of Bacann prepares for its annual fishing festival a menacing presence lurks in the shallows… The adventure is written for 3-5 Level 1 adventurers who should progress to Level 4 by the end of the first module. Should you wish to use characters at a higher level simply up the challenge rating of each combat and increase the DC on roleplaying encounters. Credits This adventure is written by Alasdair Hill.

Chapter 1.1 – On Board he adventure begins with the playing characters waking up slowly, heads spinning and in a groggy state. As they regain consciousness they notice the ground swaying violently. There is a stench of rotten flesh. The salty air stings the grazes and wounds of the characters. The adventurers quickly realise they are at sea. It’s stormy out there. There is the sound of commotion on the deck. The seafarers are battling the tempest hard. This ship jolts from left to right, struggling not to list. The howls of wind scream through the masts like banshees enveloping their prey. The playing characters are found in separate cells below deck. Thick iron bars are welded from roof to ceiling – there is no chance they can be broke free with brute force. Each cell door is locked. The PCs have been captured for reasons unknown; only that they have a reputation of certain skills that some nobles would find useful. After you have set the scene encourage the PCs to introduce themselves and question the circumstance they find themselves in. Sporadically the ship with sway and be battered by crashing waves. T Ask the PCs to make a perception check of their surroundings . 20+ - Your weapons are stashed in a crate by the ladder to deck. 18+ - A set of keys is sat on a stool towards the entrance of the deck. 15+ - Through the crack in the ceiling you notice a blue with a sigil of a Mantra Ray within a circle. 12+ - You hear a total of 3 voices above deck. 10+ - You can hear voices above deck indicating several people are on deck. Hugbold Gracefoot is a fellow imprisoned NPC. He is a human mercenary who seems resigned to his fate. It was his idea to navigate through these difficult waters. He might be able to give advice to the players on where the keys are to unlock the cells but he has little trust in anyone and he speaks only in short words. After 10 minutes one slaver comes below deck to taunt the PCs. There is an opportunity for PCs to intimidate or persuade the slavers to release them. This slaver is slobby in appearance. He is overweight and appears dim-witted. The slaver has disadvantage on persuasion and deception contests (use Insight). The slaver has a set of keys on his belt (only reveal if Hugbold has informed the group). The slaver will hurl abuse at Hugbold and drag him up to the top deck. Hugbold will call for help, spit in the slaver’s eye and resist. The players can hear commotion and shouting before a sword is drawn. After some arguments Hugbold is decapitated and his bloody head rolls down to the cell deck. During this scene the players could try and intervene. Try to build a bond between Hugbold and the players before the execution scene is played out. [Loot on minor slaver: 14 SP, a silver ring with a manta ray symbol emblazoned & a turquoise gemstone]. If there is combat with this minor slaver remove multi-attack. If he reaches 1HP and is still alive he will retreat on deck to call reinforcements. Every minute after the arrival of the first slaver roll for a sudden storm effect. Use the weather table below. The Ship’s Captain, Karsci Rock, will come below deck if PCs haven’t escaped after 10 minutes. Stat deck as pirate with multi-attack included. HP increased to 32. In combat Karsci will jump overboard if HP reaches 2 or less. If an attack takes her down to 0HP the attack was so strong Karsci will stumble backwards and overboard. After 5 random storm events or if the PCs take charge of the ship trigger the shipwreck event. Shipwreck Event “With a sudden crash from the starboard side the “Cobalt Misery” lists violently. The waves push you all to the ground with the force of a thousand horses winding you in the process. As you struggle to drag yourself off the floor you raise your head and see the ship tumble forward into a lull. The back of the ship begins to crumble, falling into the black water, as the ship starts to ascend the giant cliff face of the inbound wave. The rest of the shredded ship starts to rise, clambering to the pinnacle of the wave. In the last moments the remaining masts snap like matches as the ship falls backwards. Facing your watery fate you spend your last moments doing what...” Once each PC has attempted an action (collect weapons, jump overboard, etc) go into the final narration; “The ship crashes into the water. Wood and metal and canvass obliterate on impact. You hold onto whatever chunk of wood you can grasp onto and pray.” PCs to make a religion check to decide on how they might survive. PCs might get knocked out by flotsam or grab hold of a large raft and be protected from incoming shrapnel. Either way PCs find themselves passed out or sleeping as they float on the sea . Karsci Rock Ship Captain, Pirate Karsci Rock is a leading Slaver of the Blue Ray guild of slavers. She has a very little honour, famed for her capture of rival slavers and selling them on to the Merchant Trinity State. Karsci is well connected, doing the dirty work for the nobles of the Trinity. She knows exactly what they do with their slaves and could sell this information for a price. Karsci’s hatred is the result of a deep rooted trauma as she desires to find her true heritage. She is exceptionally ugly with boils over her face however she prides himself on her sharp captain’s uniform. She has a nervous tick when he is angry, fidgeting with his scimitar. She is particularly strong but lacks intelligence. Karci thinks she’s smarter than she is and has a tendency to bluster when taunting her enemies. She loves to inflict pain on those who cross her path including torture – she got her name “rock” by tying her victims to rocks and leaving the sea to consume their gull- pecked bodies at high tide. She has a knack at impressions and can dupe many people with her accents. [Loot: 11 GP, 3 Blue Quartz, Diamond cut scitimar (+1 damage on hit), Cloak of the Manta Ray] Chapter 1.2 – Marooned he PCs wake up in the dead of night face down on wet sand. They have beached on a mud flat. An expansive beach lies ahead. The tide is out and they are a mile from shore. Ahead is the beach and nobody is in sight. To the west cliffs of oryx black thrust into the sky. A tall stack of black rock juts out of the shallow water 2 miles from where they rest. At over 600 ft the stack’s presence casts a nervous omnipresence over them. Sea vultures circulate the top of the stack and their cries are unsettling. It seems scalable at parts but is covered with the glisten of rotted kelp. To the East they can make out the silhouette of a settlement and an unbelievably long pier-like structure crosses the mudflats for 2 miles, just touching the retreating sea. Wreckage from the ship is littered around the characters. Broken crates and flotsam is scattered along the beach. Ask PCs to make a perception check. Wreckage Loot 15+ - A bronze chest, largely intact, is embossed with the word “Apothecary – contains poisons” can be spotted deep in the mud. It is locked [DC 15] and trapped with a poison needle (DC 20 (investigation) to identify trap, DC15 Dex using thieves tools to disarm. On failure PC takes 1HP damage plus 2d10 poison damage. DC 15 Con check to prevent being poisoned for 1 hr). Chest contains three vials labelled “Potion of Healing.” 12+ - A wooden chest, largely intact, can be spotted amongst the wood and metal. It is locked [DC 10] but contains; 45 GP + 4 25GP art objects (table p134) 5+ - Wood and the odd scrap of metal bracing is all that you can see. A few gemstones of value glisten in the night. [Role 12d12 on 10 GP gemstones p134] In the distance you hear a loud explosion. You look in the direction of the settlement where the sound could be heard. A second explosion erupts and above the village a sphere of silver and blue sparkles against the clear black starry night. More fireworks fill the air and on the cool breeze you can hear the faint hubbub of celebration, of “oohs” and “aahs”, and the smell of mead drift across the mudflats. PCs can check out the stack if they wish. Put in significant challenges with quicksand and coastal monsters to encourage their movement to the village. Use beach random encounter (night) on challenge. T As PCs were looting the wreckage their noise attracts three giant crabs. Role for Stealth score for the pack of crabs. If a PC’s passive perception meets/exceeds a crab’s they notice it. Depending on how close the perception check is depends on what clues to their presence they see. After combat with the giant crabs the PCs make their way to the settlement. You can describe the journey as follows; You start a long sticky march along the mudflat towards the sound of celebration. The mud is thick and sucks you in with every step. The squelching cold surface seeps into your boots. The wind whips you, blowing sharp specks of sand in your face like a thousand microscopic needles. The sky lights up with fireworks; amethyst purple, jade green and a silver of Amaltals. The journey across the beach is only a couple of miles, but the mud slows you right down. Treat the mud as difficult terrain. Roll on the mudflat random encounter table. After their first encounter, the PCs come across the body of the first slaver face down in the mud. His fat body, grey with the deathly cold of the ocean, is stiff with rigor mortis. PCs can investigate the body and find loot (see Chapter 1) and a note that states \"Find Imrog Greenspan in Laimrig.\" After the PCs find the body roll on the random encounter table for a final encounter. Reroll if the encounter is the same. Arrival in Bacann As the PCs arrive at the village, describe the general appearance of Bacann and draw their attention to the Thirsty Tuna. The tavern is busy as the eve of the Festival of the Seas is celebrated. The owner of the Thirsty Tuna is Gregory Bluefin beside him is his trust ginger tabby cat, Kiltrud. The people at the TT are celebrating the start of the festival and are well on their way to getting sloshed. The fireworks the PCs witnessed a few hours ago have long finished but the smell of gunpowder still floats in the air. Should PCs wish to ask about the fireworks Gregory will be easy to persuade to give information (DC 8) but will become stubborn if intimidated (DC 20). Use the Festival of the Seas table for information to give. When it becomes clear the PCs have no knowledge whatsoever Gregory will become a little suspect about the origins of the PCs and will require a higher DC to give information (DC 8+ 2 for each silly question). After speaking to Gregory and any other drinkers the PCs are invited to retire to their chambers. They may wish to carouse with the other patrons of the pub (see carousing table online). 2d4 Coastal Random Encounters - Night (CR0-4) 2 A bronze dragon wyrmling swoops down and lands in front of the PCs. It is a NG dragon who will not attack - it will pronounce \"Beware those of forked tongues. Only uniting the four can their poison be cured\" before flying away. Any attempt to attack and the dragon will use its repulsion breath. If attacked after this breath it will fly away. 3 A pool of deadfish is being picked on by 2d4 Sahuagin 4 The body of the first slaver is found face down in the mud. His fat body, grey with the deathly cold of the ocean, is stiff with rigor mortis. PCs can investigate the body and find loot (se Chapter 1) and a note that states \"Find Imrog Greenspan in Laimrig.\" 5 Ask PCs to make an athletics check to try and pull themselves out of quicksand (DC13). On failure the PC is grappled by the quicksand. The PC can attempt more athletics checks to escape, how the DC increases by 1 for each failed attempt as the PC gets sucked deeper. After 2 attempts the PC takes 1D4 +1 bludgeoning damage. Other PCs can help, giving advantage on athletics checks 6 Half a dozen jellyfish are beached on the mudflats. They are transparent and a Perception check of DC12 is needed to see them. If they are stood on they respond collectively - roll initiative. The jelly fish cannot move. Inside each jellyfish is a 1d10 gold coins 7 The PCs come across three thiefs dressed in black. They appear young and on edge. They are pulling a rowing boat to shore. Three barrels are waiting to be loaded. 8 A bloated whale carcass is beached on the mudflats. A putrid stench causes PCs who fail a DC12 constitution check to fall prone and vomit, causing 1d4 poison damage. A large water ooze drips out of the eye sockets of the carcass. Within the carcass are 4 large seeds. A nature check DC10 will reveal these are seeds of the Putridicae family. After 1 week of planting six bright green berries are produced. On an even/odd d6 throw they grant they increase/decrease HP by 3d4. Bacann Small settlement – 800 inhabitants, all human. Bacann is the largest village in the area and is the main landing dock for fish on the North of the Island. The inhabitants are wind- weathered and dour with a distrust for foreigners. Their main trade is in Herring which was bountiful in the Bacann Bay area until recently. The town is famous for its long pier. Stretching across the mudflats for several kilometres, the Bacann Pier has been extended every generation as the sea has receded and fish stocks dwindled in the hope for restoring its catch to former glories. Peppered along the beach front are a number of small bungalows and smoke houses. An ice house with a short pier (it no longer reaches the water line) is situated at the most Eastern boundary of the village. A central square is found one street behind the coast-side bungalows. There is a well in the centre and a short limestone statue of a herring fisherman sits on a plinth. It’s clearly had better days. The architecture is simple and made from sandstone and the roofs are thatched with dried marram grass. Several two storey buildings line the main street up the hill from the square. These look like commercial properties. Beyond here several streets of houses can be seen with various levels of condition. Two detached homes with oryx-lined eaves catch your eye, indicating the residents’ wealth. The whole village is surrounded by a well-fortified wooden palisade. Tucked in the middle of two large buildings is a skinny wooden tavern. Its floors look uneven, its roof has seen better days, yet a certain warmth drifts from the windows. A wooden sign swings in the wind – “The Thirsty Tuna” signposts this watering hole. Laughter and the smell of mead indicates the prominence of this establishment in the village. Festival of the Seas Begins on the first Day of Tarskh, the fourth month of the year and lasts for three days. It’s tradition dates back to the early settlers of the Island who would celebrate the great harvest of Herring from Bacann Bay. It was thought that prayer and offerings to the sea were not given at this time of year no fish would be caught. Each day the following events occur; Eve of Festival – Salt fish from the previous season’s catch are eaten and fireworks, blessed by the monks of Procan, are detonated at the end of the pier to signal to the Sea that the people are preparing for their offerings. Offering Day – Historically, the people of Bacann would march in a procession wielding great maces of fire towards the end of the pier, burning the fish oil collected from the previous season. Once at the end of the pier the people of Bacann would then sacrifice a lamb and fill its bladder with gold and gemstones before throwing the riches-filled bladder into the sea. This was seen as a payment to the God Procan to deliver a healthy catch for the year. Today the people of Bacann still march with burning maces to the end of the pier but they no longer sacrifice a lamb. Instead children throw copper pieces into the sea as they walk along the pier. A local dignitary, usually the mayor, then bless the fishermen by placing silver beads around their next to bring them good luck in their catch. Setting off – The first catch of the season begins. All the fishing boats depart for deep waters in hunt for the Herring. A blessing from the Monks of Procan ship, anchored off the pier is the signal that the fishing season has formally begun. Gregory Bluefin Publican, Owner of the Thirsty Tuna, Bacann Gregory is an exceptionally ugly man. He is of middle age with receding silver hair, blue eyes and a broken, yellowed smile. A prominent birthmark can be seen along his neck – it’s a blue stripe that appears to continue down his back behind his ragged clothing. He is coy about this birthmark and is shamed by it. Gregory makes up for his rather unsavoury appearance with a muscular build. Whilst far from gifted with cognitive grace, Gregory is an honest man at heart and has a strong sense of morality. Serving Bacann’s obscene fishermen and passing sailors, Gregory has a good knowledge of local politics and is quite perceptive of current events. He can speak the Thieves’ Cant. He is generally friendly and cares for his community. However he as a hatred for a mysterious cult – the Laticudas – who have ravaged the locals for decades. He will support anyone who seeks to destroy this group. Gregory has a habit of using outlandish and flowery language to sound smarter than he really is. Never far from his side, a tabby cat called Hiltrud keeps him company. Chapter 1.3 – Earning your Keep ThePCs wake up at 10am and eventually descend into the bar. Gregory is there and is angry – he is shouting at some porters. The TT did not receive its delivery of mead this morning. Without his mead, Gregory will be unable to formally toast the Offering service at the pier later this evening. Gregory to ask PCs to trace the mead wagon and deliver it to the TT in time for the celebrations. The mead is needed for 7pm at the pier before the Fire March begins. Gregory gives the PCs a map of the area and points to the crossing hamlet of Cairidh . There is a meadery at the hamlet that produces the sweetest mead on the Island. PCs should check the route to Cairidh. PCs to start hunting for the missing mead wagon. Around town the PCs can meet the following NPCs;  Peter and Robert Skink – Sentrymen at the gate to the village  Mhari Herringbone – The Mayor of Bacann  Harris Pearl – Monk of the Procan Order Each NPC will be busy preparing for the Fire March later in the evening. They will stop to talk but generally suspicious and unhelpful. No NPC has seen the mead wagon. Leaving the town Peter and Robert Skink will not let the PCs out as they are under strict instructions. However there are a number of ways to achieve this which include; 1. Stealing the two keys (one from each sentryman) through stealth and deception. 2. Charming the sentries through their devout support for Procan. 3. Obtaining a permit from the Mayor. Stealing the keys – Each sentry will need a PC to be distracted for another to sneak up and remove the key. PCs will need to make a deception check (DC 8) followed by a stealth (DC12) and then sleight of hand (DC13) to obtain the keys. PCs will then have to wait until there is a change of guard before using them to leave. Charming the sentries – Charming the sentries with persuasion or performance (depending on what the PCs do) by quoting gospel from the words of Procan will convince them letting you go is part of God’s will. PCs will need to first convince the sentries they are followers of Procan (persuasion DC10) then inspire them to open the doors (performance DC20 or DC12 if they have spoken to Harris Pearl). Obtaining a permit – The PCs need to trace down Mayor Herringbone who is busy preparing for the festival. When they find her (at the pier) the PCs will first have to convince her to stop what she is doing. A DC 10 (persuasion) is needed to get her attention. A DC12 (persuasion) is needed to convince her you are running an errand for Gregory. IF the PCs have evidence they are working for the TT the DC drops by half. However, for every failed check the DC increases by 1 as the Mayor is very busy. If the PCs have attempted to steal keys or annoy the sentries +3 to all DC checks. Hunting for Mead Once the PCs have left the town they will take the road to Cairidh which will take 2 hours. The road is well-walked and tree lined with old oak and birch. Outside the city walls the Abbey of Procan sits proudly on a hill, the large stained glass windows refracting a myriad of colours into the temple. Within a mile the trees give way to small farmsteads. People can be seen preparing the land. To the west a large forest can be seen on the horizon. Smoke rises from it. Roll on the random encounters (Road – Day) but ignore combat situations. After any encounter ask the PCs to make a perception check to look for clues of an ambush. A DC 20 will notice tracks leaving the roadside on the outskirts of Cairidh. Continue to the Kobold combat if they detect road tracks otherwise if the PCs fail to notice this, they will arrive at the meadery at Cairidh Here they will meet the NPC Api Goldstein, the owner of the Sea Bee Brewery. Api is a friendly and patient older human. She talks a little cryptically and has a weakness for the whimsy. After some opening chat refer to the following; “I really don’t know why Greg hasn’t got his mead already?! The mead wagon set off as normal at 11pm the previous night. To be fair, the locals have had some problems with livestock being stolen from the hills and the fish store was ransacked recently. Not to mention that forest fire only two nights ago. I dunno what you have seen in your travels but I trust the bees. Any they have been behaving strangely of late. I do hope the mead wagon hasn’t suffered a similar fate.” The PCs will return to Bacann and on their way they will see tracks veering off the road outside Cairidh. Following the trail the PCs will arrive at an empty camp. A barrel of mead has been opened. When the players start entering the camp an arrow shoots across the leading PC. Take 1d6 damage on a failed DEX check (DC10) or half on success. A Kobold archer is hidden in the shrubs, two more Kobolds jump from a tree on to two other PCs. Each PC takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a failed DEX (DC15) or half on success. Two other Kobolds emerge with daggers by the mead wagon. Role for initiative. When all are killed PCs can return to the TT with the wagon, provided they have the strength to push it back onto its wheels. On return, Gregory will be mighty pleased and pay 2GP per barrel delivered. He will also offer the PCs a pint of his secret brew, giving the PCs a +1 to core stat for 1 day. PCs should be encouraged to rest for a few hours until the Offering begins. 2d4 Bacann Road Encounters - Day 2 1 Giant constrictor snake slithers across the road followed by 2 others 3 A plague doctor is walking away from Bacann. He tells you he is off to \"The Lake.\" Can sell some anti poison potions 4 1d4 Koblods, stinking of mead 5 Revellers are marching to Bacann. They smell of mead. If the PCs join in with the reverie they will be rewarded with loot (3d6 GP) plus 1d4 minor potions of healing. PCs may be inclined to attack if the wrongfully suspect they have stolen the mead. 6 1d4 Koblods, stinking of mead 7 A child runs past towards Bacann. She does not stop. Her face is pale with horror. All she says \"the snakes… the snakes…\" If pushed she will say she has run from the logging camp. 8 1 Giant constrictor snake slithers across the road followed by 2 others Peter and Robert Skink Guardsmen Peter and Robert are twin brothers in their early 20s. They are fair in appearance, short and stocky. Their enthusiasm for the rules is second to none but their intelligence is lacking. Both are holding Halberds at the gate and are gossiping about the festival. Peter and Robert will not let the PCs out of the gate as strangers need a permit from the Mayor to leave. Points that could be made include:  Peter and Robert are excited for the Fire March, having ate their weight in salted Herring the night before.  Peter and Robert disagree with each other for the reason behind the crazy storm two nights ago.  Both are devout followers of Procan, quoting a number of rites; “May the seas flow silver with bountiful scales,” “let the waves protect us,” and “Tempests be tempered.”  They need a signed permit from the Mayor to allow the PCs to pass. The gate will not be opened by them until then. The keys are located on their belts and two keys are needed – one from each of the twins. Mhari Herringbone Provost of Bacann Mhari is the Provost of Bacann. She is highly respected, serving as the Provost and civic leader of the village for 14 years. Her role is far from ceremonial. As the First Citizen she oversees the fishing rights of the seas and sits as chief judge for domestic and criminal disputes. Mhari is a devout follower of Procan and places the Temple of Procan at the centre of life for Bacann. For this reason, most villagers find her zeal uplifting and believe her worship to Procan to bring them luck. This is despite the dwindling fishing stocks. Each year the Festival of the Seas balloons in size as Mhari becomes more and more devout. It was under Mhari’s instructions that the pier be extended to its extreme length as she seeks to fish in deeper waters. Not everyone is happy with her blind devotion. For a selected few, they see Mhari as ignorant of the true reason for dwindling fishing stocks. Without any control Mhari has overfished the region. A band of fishermen have formed an opposition to her. The Bacann Baiters have increased their violent activity - spoiling fish in order to protest at their loss of livelihood. Mhari is exceptionally beautiful – she clearly moisturises. She has large opals and sapphires emblazoned on her hooded Provost gown. Mhari owes her beauty to her linage. She belongs to the House of Clupea, an old aristocratic family that used to own the island but collapsed during the last fish drought 40 years ago. The Clupea were thought to descended from merfolk, giving them a slight bluish hue. Mhari speaks with a certain aloofness and clarity that denotes her aristocratic background. She has a talent for drawing – using her artistic skills to design the pier and new Procan Abbey. PCs may need a permit from Mhari and she will be reluctant to do so as she is busy with the final preparations. She will need persuaded to give the PCs their permit to leave. In order to get a permit the PCs will need a Procan Blessing from Harris Pearl. Harris Pearl Procan Priest Harris is a stout and elderly religious leader of Bacann. He is approachable but tired and so will not follow conversations for long. A devout follower, Harris has been a follower of Procan since his father was taken underwater by a giant Kracken never to be seen again. Harris has a series of fish bone piercings in both ears and a set of prayer beads made from pearl and merfolk plaited hair. Harris is pale, given his age, but convers great wisdom to all whom speak. He is a natural linguist and can speak most common languages as well as the words of the sea. Harris has a tendency to use flowery language when describing simple things and can be difficult to follow. He can be curious about new things and people, to the point of being quite irritable with questions. Harris will speak the words of Procan including the phrase “May the waters run deep and fill your soul with the siren’s songs of love,” and “treasure sunk is treasure shared.” Chapter 1.4 – The Offering When the PCs wake up, a procession of burly fishermen are marching past the TT. They each wield a pair of burning orbs, joined together by a think iron chain. Swinging around their heads, these fire walkers are leading the Offering Procession down to the pier. PCs are encouraged to walk down with Gregory who is just about to leave the TT. As the PCs walk down they see many of the Bacann traditions on show.  Children are running alongside them, throwing in copper pieces into the shallow sea.  Fishermen are being sent off by their partners and bystanders are blessing them with words from Procan.  Games of luck are being played along the street. Encourage the PCs the engage in festivities as a way to lead them into a false sense of security. Before the get to the pier the PCs are encouraged by Peter and Robert Skink to sit in on a game of “Liars Dice.” The rules are below; 1. Each player places a bet on the game. 2. Each player roles two d6 and keeps the score hidden. 3. The first player declares how many of one number they think there is across the all the dice played (e.g. 3 3s). 4. The player to their left can do one of two actions; 5. Raise the stake of the same number (e.g. 4 3s), different number (e.g. 4 2s) or raise the number (e.g. 3 4s). 6. Call the previous player a “Liar.” 7. If “Liar” is called all players reveal their dice. If there are a number of dice equal or greater to the challenged player’s claim they win and the challenger is out. On a correct challenge the “liar” is out. 8. Continue until only one person is left. They will all bets. Play twice. One the second game the Skinks bet a family heirloom – “Luck Buckle” – a fish shaped belt buckle that when worn grants the wearer advantage on charisma checks. It can only be used once per interaction per day. All is not as it seems If the NPCs are asked about the festival or the mayor you can add some intrigue by suggesting all is not as happy as it seems. They Mayor’s over zealous use of tradition over scientific evidence have many people cynical of her actions. There is a clear disregard of the evidence that the fish have disappeared due to overfishing yet to stop the ceremonies and traditions will only bring the wrath of the fishermen and women in the village. Gregory in particular doesn’t believe the ceremony will do anything but of course appreciates the lift in trade during the season. Once the PCs have played their game they continue to the pier. If PCs conducts a perception check (DC8) they may notice that amongst the crowds are several people with animals sigils emblazoned on their chests – fish are very popular, rocs are present but so are a few snakes (DC13) and a manta ray (DC15). An arcana check will pick up magic being used (DC8) in the festivities. A DC15 will identify a mixture of good and bad magic, a DC22 will alert the PCs to something dangerous in the air but there is too much interference to find its source. At the end of the pier a stage has been set. In the centre is the Procan Priest, Harris, and the Provost Mhari. They are ready to begin the silver beading of the fishermen and the bladder of gemstones is on a plinth, ready to be ceremoniously dropped into the sea. The fire walkers form a circle around the stage and put on an impressive display of acrobatics. Their fire orbs swing above their heads as they juggle them between each other. A drumming group provides a pounding beat to the fire dance. Every slap of the drum timed to a throw of the orb. The tempo speeds up and the fire walkers throw their orbs higher and faster. Flames dance and the crowds scream in awe. The beat reaches a climax and with the final hit of the drum, the fire orbs are launched into the sea and darkness descends on the pier. Candles are lit and suddenly the crowd start screaming. People are running around everywhere – frantically trying to escape of the pier. On the stage the body of the priest can be seen collapsed on the plinth. His eyes a dead dark blue. Snakes are pouring out of his mouth – slapping on the floor and launching their venomous jaws at the nearest villager. People are fighting off the snakes – some are jumping in the sea to avoid their clutches. The Provost is nowhere to be seen. Perception of the scene 15+ - In the distance a small vessel can be seen sailing at breakneck speed. It’s mast is dressed with a sail of samphire green. Emblazoned on this sail is a sigil – a black constrictor snake wrapped around a lightning bolt. It is sailing East and… 12+ - A trap door is open on the stage – it drops straight into the sea. Perception of the priest. 20+ - Three small dots on the back of his neck indicate he was hit by a trio of poison darts. A 15+ History check will allow a PC to identify the shape and pattern of the dots and link it to a snake venom from the rare Laticudas sea snake. In addition… 15+ - In the priest’s right hand is a wooden chalice containing small black spheres. A nature check of 10+ will allow the PC to spot a few snake larvae moving around inside some of the spheres. The PCs can fight back the 5 constrictor snakes that are attacking the villagers. If they do this before any perception checks of the scene they will miss the boat sailing away with the Provost. If the PCs have not perceived the boat or trapdoor Gregory will approach them and inform them this this looks like the work of the Laticudas Cult. They worship an ancient snake-god in an attempt to rule the Seas and have not been active for over 60 years. They secure their power from the blood of the deep sea Laticudas constrictor that is native to the Island. The Laticudas Sect The Laticudas worshiped the ancient Sea snake Gods of ancient lore. They believed that failure to devote their souls to the Snake God will result in the death of all fish and venomous snakes will rain from the sky. Before Bacann was establish the local communities will sacrifice their Elders to appease the Gods. When Procan’s peaceful blessings arrived on the island the locals quickly adopted the new ways. The Laticudas still exist as a small band of eccentrics. Over the years the fish stocks dwindled and the Laticudas Cult regained its support. Sixty years ago the Laticudas remerged with their murderous ceremonies as they killed off all the Elders of Bacann. A bloody battle for the heart and soul of the town ensued with the Warriors of Procan destroying the Laticudas Cult. Gregory’s father was the General of the Warriors but was killed in the battle. Since then any mention of the Laticudas Cult has been punished with banishment and the Mayor’s of Bacann have been in total debt to the Church of Procan for their protection. They used to have a hide out in Bas Cave, 10 miles East up the coast. PCs can either march their way to the cave. This will take them 3 hours. If they do this they will have to cross the beach – use the random encounter (beach) table. PCs could steal a boat and follow in pursuit. This will take 1.5 hours. If they do this use the random encounter (shallows) table. On arrival at Bas Cove, PCs will encounter a solid stone cliff face and a cauldron of samphire-green flame. On the top of the cliff there are five points. At the top of each point is a torch. PCs will need to light each of these to open up a secret door. A moderately hard perception check (DC14) will identify footprints that have been covered up leading to the door. Chapter 1.5 – Into the Caves When the PCs enter the Bas Cove Caves they will arrive in a kelp-covered room. A damp briny smell oozes from all walls. The dungeon layout can be seen below. Use the room numbers to locate the room description in the table that follows. Use the room sketches at the end of the chapter to assist with visualising each room. The Cave Quarters Room 0.0 – Atrium The atrium where the PCs enter the cave complex; it is a large kelp-covered room. The floor is sandy and footprints might be seen. A dank, damp mouldy smell is overpowering. There are two exits, one on each side. Room 0.1 – Treasure Hoard Two identical chests are found on short platforms at opposite ends of a rectangular room. Two large snake head gargoyles adorn opposite walls. A pile of rubbish can be seen in the centre of the room. On a good perception check the PCs will notice puddles of water on the ground. An excellent perception check will lead PCs to notice kelp only grows up halfway up the walls that are damp – suggesting a water line. Each chest is trapped. Only if both are opened will it trigger. The chests are locked and a SoH check with picks (DC12) will open each of them. A perception check of DC18 will notice the contents of the chest rest of a scale and two small groves can be seen where the scale will raise when the contents are removed. If the contents are removed the chests will make a click noise and the scale will raise. Nothing will happen unless both are triggered. A SoH DC18 will prevent the scales from triggering is an equal weighted object is put in their place. If triggered a stone door will slam shut and water will start pouring out of the snake gargoyles. The PCs will drown if they cannot escape the room. The door can be broken with magical power. To stop the trap the PCs can replace equally weighted items in the chests OR place their fingers in the eyes of each stone snake. Each chest contains a leather pouch containing 20 gemstones (roll on 15GP table) Room 0.2 – Study A rustic study is furnished with a desk bookshelf and bed. The desk is recently used and contains a number of sketches of maps and instructions. A scroll is wrapped up on the desk. An arcane check DC12 will confirm it is magical and a history check DC15 will confirm it is an incantation of the ancient merfolk. It is written in an unfamiliar language using an elvish alphabet. A caster class PC is able to read it. When read it causes a blue-green mould to light up – bringing 30ft of light to the area. It can also be used to light up the outline of a door at the dead end. Only when this is illuminated can the secret door be opened. The PCs now enter the ancient Laticudas Temple where they will encounter a Laticudas Priestess, her henchmen and release the Provost of Bacann. The Laticudas Temple Room 0.3 – The Chapel A Long chamber is banked by to sets of raised pews. At the end of the room an octagonal stage can be seen. Drapes adorn the walls with various embroidered scenes of snakes and tempests crashing against rocks. The room is damp and in disrepair. Sound echoes like a cathedral. You can hear the screeches of two Sahuagin arguing on the stage. They have not noticed you when you entered. Two Sahuagin are encountered with 18SP and 2 hematite stones as loot on each. Room 0.4 – The Robing Room A fresco of a ritual hangs on the wall. It depicts a man tied to a post with a sea of sakes climbing over him. When touched or in close proximity it starts to wail and scream. Footsteps can be heard receding in the distance. There is a trapped secret door in the wall. The door is locked and a small snake head gargoyle protrudes from the wall at eye height. To disarm, PCs must place their fingers in the eye sockets whilst unlocking the door (DC12). Unlocking the door (DC12) when disarmed has no effect. A failed disarm will release a spray of snake venom at the PC opening the door causing 1d4 poison damage. The PC is blind for 10 minutes. Room 05 – Secret Room In the small room sits a rusted large chest. It is easy to open as it is unlocked. 11 Chalcedony (opaque white) gemstones plus a short sword with a serpent shaped blade, 1d6 +1 poison (venom) damage. Target takes 1d4 damage on next turn on a failed constitution save (DC 12). Room 0.6 – The Kitchen A small galley room with a bar, broken barrels and a couple of benches. Charred rock is covered in the embers of past camp fires. A place to rest. Room 0.7 – Sleeping Quarters Two rows of beds indicate this room was a barracks of some sort. Nothing but broken bed frames and chairs are left. At the far side there is a thick iron portcullis preventing access to the corridor beyond. Midway up the left side of the wall a large fungal growth sticks to the rocks. It seems to grow radially from a centre crack in the wall. It has a soft blue hue that seems to pulsate. On a close inspection the wall seems to be destroyed and only held together loosely by a web of mycelial tendrils. One Sahuagin and 3 Kobolds are located in this room. Room 0.8 – Ablutions A bank of latrines rest on one wall and basins, carved out of the rock are filled with fungi. Mushroom spores fill the air. Their blue, tiny fruiting bodies puff turquoise dust into the air. Ingestion causes the player to shrink to tiny size for 1 hour. Room 0.9 – The Priest’s Quarters A large, decadent room appears to be the master’s quarters. Four snake pillars hold up the right hand side of the room. The walls are damp but adorned with rotten embroidery. An old rug lines the floor and a large Laticudas emblem can be seen on the fading blue-green fabric. A four poster bed is on a raised platform. A body of old cleric rests on the bed complete with staff. Bodies of sahuagin litter the floor. Staff – “Staff of Water Snake” magical item (see “Staff of Python” that converts to constrictor snake (not giant)). The staff is held in the body’s left hand. Careful inspection (DC 20) will spot a clasp and lever mechanism under the right elbow that pulls when the staff is moved. To disarm the skeleton has to be raised and the clasp moved (SoH DC 20). If the skeleton snaps the trap is triggered. Trap – 4 constrictor snakes spill out of the mouth of the snake idol at the other end of the room. Room 0.10 – Guard’s Room Rusty primitive weapons are found on a shelf. Wooden tables and chairs litter the room. It seems like this was a guard room of some description. “A shield of snake protection (+1 to grappled by snake DC saves)” is found in the corner of the guard room surrounded by 2 swarms of giant rats. Room 0.11 – The Prison Three skeletons are tied up to the wall by chains. This is a prison cell. Illumination of the wall using glow mould incantation reads, “Laticudas will choke you, light the eyes to deflect their gaze.” Room 0.12 – Guard’s Room Another guard room with nothing but rusty old scimitars. Room 0.13 – Attic Room A grill in the floor leads to the holy chamber below. You can hear incantations and screams. The floor appears to be moving and you can make out snakes slithering around a plinth. The steel grill is impenetrable and a magical force field prevents you from moving it. Make a charisma saving throw (DC 12) on failure PC is “suggested” and will not resist constriction by a snake in the next 8 hours. PCs that cannot be charmed are immune to the suggestion. The Temple Sanctum Once the PCs descend the stairs they will have a choice of two ante rooms to enter. They are symmetrical in design and have the same events occurring. Rooms -1 & -2 – Ante Rooms A plinth sits in the centre of a grand fountain. A beam of light passes through a hole in the ceiling and highlights the empty plinth. Around the room 6 snake statues face the fountain. 2 Sahuagin Baron Guards stand at a heavy stone door that is closed. Each guard is wearing a helmet with 6 snakes facing out. To open the door one of the helmets must be placed on the plinth. The light is magnified and focussed by lens in the helmet. Light of different colours pour out of the helmet onto the snake statues. The ground rumbles and the stone door opens. Loot from each Sahuagin Barons include; 6GP per sahuagin plus a bronze helmet containing 6 gemstones – Azurite (blue) (10GP), Moss Agate (pink) (10GP), Banded Agate (white) (10GP), Quartz (yellow) (50 GP), Zircon (pale green) (50GP), Garnet (red) (100GP). Room -3 – The Laticudas Lair The central shrine room is adorned with blue and green gemstones. Freezes of snakes in battle with humans and shops are carved into the damp granite rocks. A moat surrounds a central prayer platform inform of a loud underground waterfall. Lying on the altar is the Provost of Bacann. She is tied up with magical snake bonds. A Laticudas Priestess, Latupa NPC, is summoning a swarm of constrictor snakes from an underground waterfall in the lair. The Lair takes triggers an event at the start of each round. Choose one of the following events (note each event cannot occur more than once in succession);  2 Giant Constrictor Snakes emerge from the waterfall and attack the two nearest PCs.  All snakes stand tall to the sound of Latupa’s incantations. All PCs within 10 ft of a snake must make a DC12 charisma saving throw. On failure the PC is charmed and cannot resist constriction for the next round.  Water levels rise by 3 ft, slowing down all PCs by 5ft. Loot from the priestess on success include; Chime of Opening, Ring of swimming on the body, Art Objects (25GP), Embroidered silk handkerchief (with Laticudas emblem), 3 x Small gold bracelet, Cloth-of-gold vestments, Copper chalice with silver serpent wrapped around stem, Pair of engraved bone dice with snake eyes for the number one. Once Mhari Herringbone is rescued the PCs make their way out of the Temple. The cave entrance is locked so the characters must exit via the level 1 and 2 stairs which take them to the five torches at the top of the cliffs. The PCs return to the TT after escorting Mhari to her quarters. She needs to rest before the main ceremony tomorrow. Chapter 1.6 – Setting off Ceremony On return to the Thirsty Tuna the residents of Bacann, at least those of high esteem, are to be found waiting anxiously in the Tavern eager to hear news of the PC’s search for the Mayor. The locals celebrate the rescue of the Mayor and the PCs have an opportunity for carousing before retiring for a long rest. A group of Procan worshippers are huddled in the corner of the Tavern and look concerned. They disapprove of any celebration and wish to honour the dead, including Harris Pearl, whose body is interred at the Procan Abbey outside of the town. The Setting Off ceremony is scheduled to begin at day break. The Provost is keen to continue as planned, to not stir any concern in the locals or bring bad omens on the town. The fishermen will not forgive her if they begin the fishing season without the Procan blessings. The Procan priests wish to hold a service to honour Harris Pearl and stall the Setting Off. Provost Mhari has the final word. A DC25 is required to persuade her to delay the ceremony. Depending on how the PCs role play this you can offer + 4 to Charisma if any Blessing of Procan is used to persuade the Provost to change her mind. Gregory is sceptical about the ceremony continuing. He can be persuaded to speak to the Provost (DC15) who will reduce the DC for the Provost to DC15. The outcome of this encounter will determine the events of the following day. Go to either the Setting Off Ceremony or Honouring the Dead. Setting Off Ceremony In the morning Provost Mhari will call for the players to attend the Lord’s vessel as her guests of honour. Read out the following passage describing the mood of the town as the players walk to the quayside. Bunting of gold and turquoise hang mournfully from pillar and eaves. Half empty tankards of mead lie littered across the cobbled street, table lay untouched from the night before. Few villagers are about, instead choosing to spend this Setting Off confided in the comfort and safety of their homes. As you approach to pier a stale salty smell reminds you of the horrors of the previous night. Charred fire stones, discarded before they could be thrown into the sea, smoulder forlornly. Unused and sullen, a ceremony unceremoniously frozen in time. Blood and snake corpses litter the pier, causing you to gag. At the end of the pier a small gathering of the most stoic of villagers are keen to get the ceremony over with. Half a dozen fishing vessels are loaded with supplies. Their skippers, ready to set sail, are being blessed with pearl beads by the remaining Procan priests. Their loved ones watch anxiously as they embark into the seas. Two small ceremonial boats are tethered to the pier. The first vessel is richly adorned with mother of pearl and gold leaf. A swirling pattern of waves and fish is etched into the bow of the boat. A banner flutters in the wind; turquoise and gold fish jump promisingly from a wave. The second vessel is modest in detail except for a large gold trident relief on the starboard side. At the end of the trident each spoke is replaced with a different precious stone – emerald, opal and onyx refract the morning sun, casting a radiance over the small, saddened crowd. A large banner with the sigil of Procan fills with the wind proudly. At the end of the pier the playing characters are met with the Provost, her guardsmen, the town blacksmith and the Masters of Fish and Coin (more on the NPCs below). The remaining priests of Procan, having finished their blessings, huddle close by ready to board their vessel. Provost Mhari introduces the players to her group and pronounces them as Bacann’s guests of honour. The townsfolk thank them for rescuing the Provost and offer them gifts (roll on table). In conversation the priests from the previous night continue to argue not to go ahead with the service without first honouring Harris Pearl. After some discussion the priests board their vessel. PCs can choose to join them or join the Mayor’s boat. They will need to convince the Provost to allow them to do so (DC16). The setting off ceremony begins. Fishing boats lead a flotilla into the bay with the Lord’s vessel behind them. The Procan ship anchors surrounded by the fishing fleet. Provost Mhari begins the service with the following speech; “In the name of the people of Bacann, I give to thee my undying service. Custodian of the Seas, give us your treasures, protect us from the evil abyss and we shall eternally deliver to thee our souls and our hearts. May the trident of Procaan guide our men to your bounties.” The Master of Fish lights a cauldron of bright blue and yellow flame, signalling to the anchored Procan ship to begin the final blessing. Should the PCs wish to detect magic a DC15 will notice a strong magical presence in the area. A DC20 will identify it as evil, a DC23 will find its source on the Lord’s vessel. As the priests light their cauldron in response a loud wail screeches from beneath the waves. Ships start to list as waves begin to crash. A dull, dark and forbidding scream penetrates the surface of the sea as a large three-headed snake Hydra rears its head. It turns all three of its heads onto the Procan ship and pulls back their mouths, bearing sharp venomous teeth. With a final shrill, the snake heads launch at the priests. In one monstrous swoop three priests are bitten clean in half, blood spurting from their entrails as they collapse into the sea. The shock of the impact rips the hull in two causing it to sink, drowning the remaining priests. The shockwave caused by the Hydra as it submerges capsizes 1d6 fishing boats as they hurriedly try to turn back to the quay. The PCs could try and engage with the Hydra or use whatever means to rescue the fishermen in the sea. They can take the Lord’s vessel out and try to lift bodies from the water etc. Looking on the Provost is frozen in shock and cannot be shaken out of this catatonic state. Her guardsmen are throwing up over board and the dignitaries have their heads in their hands; shivering with panic. The Master of Fish, Rodrig Able-Tongue, proclaims. “Laticudas” and stares at the players, signalling to them to turn the ship around. Honouring the Dead In the morning the Priests of Procan call into the Thirsty Tuna and invite the PCs to the Abbey outside of the town to bear witness to the blessing of the body of Harris Pearl. Describe the abbey in basic terms, including the trident. A perception check can be used to determine the detail in which the players pick up on. A religion and history check can be used to determine what information can be gleaned about the abbey and trident. The Abbey of Procan A modest, stone building located on the outskirts of the village, the Abbey of Procan is famed for its intricate stained glass window depicting a sea scene and a giant gold trident. Each prong emblazoned with different colours and a central jewel shines through the window, illuminating the church. The church was constructed over 400 years ago when the first Procan worshippers landed on the beaches of Bacann. Its purpose was to act as a beacon of hope to the region following a bitter war with an ancient snake-worshiping sect. The Trident of Procan Made from solid gold and standing at5 ft long this large relic was used by the early priests of Palan to smite those who dared challenge their authority. The three large spikes are deadly themselves however when completed with their jewels the trident becomes a force of unspeakable arcane might. The three jewels were deliberately hidden to prevent the trident being used against the church. A forth jewel usually sits at the centre of the trident head. It is thought this turquoise gemstone contains the soul of Procan himself. The highest ranking priest, Koldo Usk, is leading the ceremony. Kolodo is concerned about the fervour of the Provost and her refusal to back down from the setting off ceremony. Too many unusual events have occurred that is making him anxious. With some persuasion, Kolodo can give some information about the gold trident at the altar. He will ask that you try one more time to persuade the Provost to cancel the setting off ceremony. Harris Pearl is lying on an elevated platform dressed in the formal turquoise and gold of the Church of Procan. His eyes are covered in gold fish coins and in his hand he clasps a small gold trident, a model of the large item seen on the altar. A perception check DC15 will notice a small Fish-shaped necklace around his neck the seems to be a purse or container. A sleight of hand check when a PC approaches the body to kiss his forehead (DC15) will allow the PC to sneakily take the necklace. The Provost and her dignitaries are not present yet but will enter after four questions have been asked. The Provost enters with her entourage (see the group in the Setting Off ceremony) and says a few words of prayer to the dead. Kolodo begins the service. Read the following passage out; “We gather her in the name of the great Custodian of the Seas to bless our fallen leader before we set his body into the waters to meet Procan. His dedication to the people of Bacann has no equal. We will be forever in his debt. Were it not for his blind service to the Great Custodian we will be not be here. No fish. No bounties. May the Trident of Procan protect your soul.” With the final words Kolodo splashes holy salt water over Harris Pearl and kisses his forhead. He invites all attendees to do the same. Following this service Harris’ body is taken onto a cart and everyone processes to the peir where two boats are waiting. The priests, led by Kolodo, and Harris’ body board the Procan vessel. The dignitaries board the Lord’s vessel. Several fishing boats join the flotilla. From here continue the Hydra encounter from the cauldron lighting section. The First Meeting As the Lord’s vessel pulls up to the quay, Gregory’s tabby cat, Kiltrud can be seen sitting patiently. Using Speak with Animals will allow the PCs to converse with the cat who will explain what happens next otherwise the PCs will need to follow him back to TT and through the secret cellar door (perception DC 15, trapped DC 15 – spiked door handle 2d4 damage, disarm SoH DC15). In the secret room Gregory, Kiltrud, Api and Rodrig are sitting pensively, waiting for your attendance. Gregory explains ; “The time has come. In recent days Harris and Kolodo have expressed horror from their visions. In their dreams a fish famine brings unbearable suffering. Snakes and evil spirits instead flood the nets of fishing boats, gorging on the souls of the people of Bacann. We dismissed these visions as a senile old man’s imagination, yet since your arrival only three nights ago I fear truth was in their hallucinations.” Rodrig adds; “In times gone by, the old gods were worshiped here by a paranoid sect known as the Laticudas. Their morbid practices of sacrifice to the Smake Gods were banished when the Church of Procan took over this land. But only after a battle with the remaining cultists has an uneasy peace been secured here. With today’s shocking return of the Laticuda it is clear that the Sect seeks to regain power across us all.” If you have not completed the Honouring the Dead, Harris’ body will lay in wake in the Abbey. Gregory encourages you to go see the body and find further information. The trident in the Abbey is a relic used in the past to banish the Laticudas Sect into the abyss. However, its power corrupts all those who have wielded it. To prevent a new Sect bent on power emerging the Priests of Procan scattered the four jewels that gave it power. Nobody alive today knows where they are or what they do. In Harris’ gold fish necklace there is an inscription that reads; Procan’s power from four is known, That Oryx of Black is kept safe in bone. A shard of Emerald is hidden deep, A Quercus enveloped in natural sleep. A pure white Opal seals the fate, Looking down on all those who await. Procan’s power from four is known, Held by the final crystal turquoise stone. This poem directs the PCs to the locations of the three shards (Shard of Oryx, Shard of Emerald, Shard of Opal) and the final turquoise stone which, when secured to the trident unleashes its power. From here on the PCs can follow any path to find the jewels and in any order. Refer to the appropriate module.  Shard of Oryx (“Bone”) is found in the crypt below the Abbey. Go to Module 2.1  Shard of Emerald (“Quercus”) is found in the Mother Tree in Bacann wood. Go to Module 2.2  Shard of Opan (“Looking down”) is found through a portal on top of the Bacann Stack. Go to Module 2.3  The Jewel of Bacann is found in the library of the Old Laticudas Mansion. Go to Module 3.0. Modules 2 and 3 Coming Soon! Thanks for playing this adventure!
