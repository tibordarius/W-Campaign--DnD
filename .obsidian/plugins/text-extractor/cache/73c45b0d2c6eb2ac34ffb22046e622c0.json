A terrible storm blew up out of the blue, and the Vesta, a small cargo ship, was tossed onto the shore by the waves. Everyone aboard was dead, captain lashed to the wheel. The ship’s log tells a blood-chilling tale of the crew disappearing or dying one by one, until only the captain was left, crazed with fear, and ranting about monsters. Strangely enough the main cargo they were sent to deliver were just boxes filled with dirt. The Town Council would pay to find out what happened, calm everyone down. What’s going on- Not vampires! A local Wizard (possibly Keldak) or Alchemist ordered a rare specimen of blood-drinking plant blights to study. The specimens were supposed to be dormant but awakened during the journey and killed the crew. Now they have infiltrated the village, killing again and again. An examination of the body found at the docks the previous night (DC 10 Wisdom Medicine) reveals the body has been drained of blood, and is covered with small scratches, uncharacteristic of vampires. A careful search (Intelligence Investigation DC 15) of the ship’s papers shows the boxes were ordered by a wizard and contained three specimens of a rare and dangerous magical plant creature, “blood blights.” An Intelligence Investigation or Wisdom (Perception) DC 12 search of the murder sites or the ship reveal strange, thorny vines. Either of those clues can allow a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check (with advantage if the PCs have access to an appropriate library). If this check succeeds, reveal the life cycle and fire damage vulnerabilities of Blood Blights. When awakened, they feed on blood at night and rest, rooted in the earth during the day. They prefer dark and moist places, fresh water (like under the warehouse pier by the river). This information, combined with studying the location of the discovered body (a DC 14 Intelligence Investigation check) clues the PCs to that warehouse pier. Another way to find the lair is to search around where the body was found, if the PCs know what to look for, a DC 14 Wisdom (Survival) check leads them to the warehouse pier, where the blights are camouflaged in the scrub plants that grow under the pier. On the rising of the next full moon after awakening, they reproduce, each blood blight generating three more blood blights. And the next full moon is tonight…. 2: The Empty Lighthouse The tale. The lighthouse on Flarahan Isle was out! My ship almost crashed near those rocks! We sent a launch to find out, but the place was empty. All three crew vanished, place looked ransacked. We had to move on to catch the tide. They will be needing some people to find what happened to the crew and re-light the beacon, at least until they can free up some more light keepers, probably pay very well. Flarahan Isle’s a strange place, you know. The Islanders never settled there- they graze their animals there, but never stay there overnight. And they never go near the ruins. What’s going on- A new keeper, Tomas, joined the crew a few months ago. Tomas was a curious, scholarly type, and used his off hours to investigate the ruins on Flarahan Isle. He discovered an ancient talisman, a crude ivory carving of a kind of humanoid squid person. These ruins were the temple of an Aboleth cult, and the talisman carried some of their psionic madness that slowly infected the crew. The last night, securing the tower’s cliffside storage shed against the storm, Tomas fell over the cliffs, his body (still with the talisman) still dangling on the cliffs. The crew’s psychic reaction with the talisman attra cted a Chuul from the sea, who ransacked the lighthouse, then killed and carried off the rest of the crew. The Chuul is coming 3 again with the next storm, and only defeating it, destroying the talisman, or returning the talisman from the cliffs to the sea will drive the Chuul off and secure the lighthouse. Investigating the ransacked lighthouse shows signs of huge claws having torn open the doors. There is a kettle on the stove and two sets of oilskins hanging by the door, next to one empty peg (Tomas’s) An Intelligence Investigation or Wisdom Perception check, DC 12, finds the lighthouse log. The senior keeper was a spiteful man, and he has very negative things to say about the new Crew Member Tomas, describing him as a suspicious oddball. Tomas was apparently some kind of academic, and spent his off hours exploring the ruins on the far s ide of the island. About a week ago, the notes describe increasing paranoia and anger among the crew, with Tomas disappearing for long stretches, and strange clicking sounds heard around the sea at night. The final entry, barely legible, tells of a huge s torm brewing, with Tomas being sent to secure the western storage shed. Studying Tomas’s Bunk, an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check (made with Advantage if any PCs have woodworking tool proficiency or the Criminal Background) reveals a floorboard hiding place. Inside are Tomas’ notes on his investigation of the ruins, including sketches of the talisman. As they investigate, a storm begins to brew outside. After two hours on the Island, the PCs notice the storm brewing. The wind rises and a sense of tension and paranoia creeps through everyone there, as they hear clicking and chittering sounds in the wind. Everyone should make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they take one level of Exhaustion (they can no longer remember how long they’ve been on the island, insisting it’s been days, maybe weeks). The Chuul attacks shortly after the storm hits. Climbing to Tomas’s body takes Strength (Athletics) DC 16 in the pounding rain and waves. When they get to Tomas’s body, the Talismans psionic power lashes out at the PCs, acting as a Confusion spell. 3: The Orange Maiden The tale. That’s the ship they’re all talking about, she drifted into the shipping lanes yesterday. They tried to hail her, but no one was on deck. They saw a half -raised signal flag. “All dead.” She’s almost drifted to clogging up the Strait, a danger to every other ship going through. Harbormaster’d pay well to get her towed out. What’s going on. The Orange Maiden is a smuggling ship, and in its last port picked up a cursed cargo, a chest of diamonds from a distant, snowy land. The diamonds act the vessel for 2-3 Frost Maidens (Use Specter, with two changes. 1: They are immune to cold damage and vulnerable to fire damage. 2: Their Life Drain does cold, not necrotic damage.) The Frost Maidens awakened on the voyage, and killed the crew one by one, draining the warmth from their bodies. When the PCs come aboard, they are happy to have new victims to feed on. As the PCs explore or prep the ship for towing, the Frost Maidens will try to separate them into ones or twos and attack. Failing that, the Frost Maidens will reanimate the frozen corpses into ice zombies (use zombies, but immune to cold damage and vulnerable to fire damage). Those ice zombies will attack the PC, trying to split them up into ones or twos. The PCs can defeat the Frost Maidens in combat, o r by soaking the diamonds in rum and alchemical explosive and igniting them (though that fire will quickly and explosively spread through the ship). On board, the PCs notice the air is perceivably colder than before. The PCs find the bodies of the cr ew all over the ship. Their faces are contorted in expressions of terror, and the bodies feel cold as ice. A DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) or Intelligence (Nature) check shows they all died of hypothermia. However, where hypothermia normally takes at least a few minutes, this appears to be an almost instant death. The ship’s papers are in the captain’s cabin, and a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check, made with Advantage if any PC knows Thieves’ Cant reveals the Orange Maiden was smuggling several barrels of very flammable Alchemical regents among their official cargo of rum. They also picked up a chest of stolen diamonds, which was hidden in a false - bottomed 4 rum barrels. A DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check (made with Advantage if one of the PCs’s has the Criminal Background) finds the false-bottomed barrel. As they investigate, the frozen bodies begin to stir… 4: The Swinging Coffin The tale. Oh, everyone in Saltmarsh’s heard of Captain Abbot’s tomb! They say he loved the sea so much he never wanted to rest in dry land, and was packed in rum in a lead coffin, suspended by chains off the ground. They say he had a great treasure buried with him, and I think I heard some fella around here saying he found Abbot’s crypt, and wa s going to search it for the treasure tonight… What’s going on- Captain Abbot is not buried in the strange coffin, and there is no treasure. On Abbot’s last voyage, he unknowingly picked up a life-drinker, a strange, water-draining creature from a distant desert land. It appears as a large man with oversized, leech-like fingers. After the life-drinker killed several of his crew, he was able to trap it in rum and then seal it in his own prepared tomb. The fools who’ve found his crypt are about to unleash the life-drinker on Saltmarsh. A few days ago, Reese Lantron, a stubborn and greedy town council clerk discovered some old papers of the Abbot family, including the sale plot for Captain Abbot’s crypt. Armed with this, he is trying to recruit some Adventurers to break into the crypt and find the fabled treasure, the soonest night he can (he wants to avoid his theft of the papers being discovered). He’ll try to recruit the PCs, and if they turn him down, Reese will approach a more naïve and gullible group (possibly including someone with connections to a PC). If the PCs agree to open the casket, the life-drinker awakens when they drain out the rum, and water-drinks Reese dry. Reese drops his lantern and ignites the rum, and the life-drinker escapes in the chaos. The life-drinker then begins stalking the PCs (having gotten their scent when they opened the casket), trying to find them alone at night and drain them, in the meantime feeding on other people in the village. If a group of NPCs open it, the PCs arrive just as they’re opening it, the same situation happens, and the life-drinker stalks and eliminates the other NPCs. As well as the second group. A DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the non - crypt opening victims are all descendants of the Captain Abbot’s original crew. The Life Drinker has got their scent and is hunting them down as revenge for its imprisonment. 5: The Cursed Ship. The tale The Ivan Vasily? She’s cursed, they say. Half the crew deserted at this port, even though Captain Anton was paying double wages. I heard he’s up to triple wages now, but only the most desperate sea scrapings in the port have signed on. It’s a shame, the ship’s carrying a cargo of badly needed grain. They say the night watchmen see a strange, glowing figure walking the deck. The next day they’re driven to rage, madness, paralyzed staring into space or hurling themselves into the sea. It’s a death ship, and no decent sailor’d crew her. What’s going on- 5 The Ivan Vasiliy was severely damaged in a storm three months ago, and the ship stopped at a small, wooded island to make repairs. One of the trees they chopped down to repair the main mast was the binding tree of a slumbering Dryad. The Dryad is acting subtly, haunting the ship, and seeking revenge on those who destroyed her home. She is attacking subtly, using her Fey Charm ability as a Crown of Madness Spell on those crew she finds alone at night. If she’s found out and pursued, she escalates to open attacks using her Entangle and Shillelagh spells. She can be defeated in combat or banished by chopping down the mast and knocking it into the sea. The ship is a miserable, tense place with a crew who are half desperate, half incompetent, and drunk as they can be. A day after setting sail, two of the men on night watch disappear (hurling themselves into the sea). The next night, the PCs are awakened by screaming, as three of the night watch savagely tear into each other. The next night, one of th e night watch is found catatonic. Captain Anton varies between stalking the ship, yelling about discipline, and hiding in his cabin, drinking. The first and second mate (old friends and shipmates of Anton) are the only thing holding the crew together and holding back outright anarchy or mutiny. They are harried and exhausted, but willing to talk to the PCs about what happens if the PCs demonstrate competence or leadership. A DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check will convince either of them to share what they know, including that the incidents started a few days after the repairs. A few other crew members will talk more readily (DC 12 Charisma/ Persuasion) but will only share garbled ghost stories about strange glowing women walking the deck before disasters. Those crew could, however (especially with gifted rum rations) answer questions about the timeline or the location of the repairs. A DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) or Charisma (Persuasion) check can find Old Saul, one of the crew who actually cut down the trees. Old Saul will tell the PCs that the “branches moved strange, alive-like, and there’d a sound like screams under the saw blades). Studying the ships logs (in the captain’s cabin) could also reveal the timeline of the haunting. Studying the repaired mast, the PCs can make a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check to be able to tell this was wood from a Dryad tree. After a few nights, the night watch crews are doubled and the PCs are put on watch… Other Works: For a full nautical horror adventure, I’ve adapted John Carpenter’s 1980 classic “The Fog” to for 2 adventure settings. Fog Over Saltmarsh for Ghosts of Saltmarsh and Fog over Barovia for Curse of Strahd. https://www.dmsguild.com/product/359994/Fog-over-Saltmarsh?view_as_pub=1 https://www.dmsguild.com/product/359997/Fog-Over-Barovia?view_as_pub=1 If you’re the kind of person running spooky nautical adventures, and you know kids, there’s a good chance you’re in the market for Halloween and spooky stuff that’s kid friendly. I’d like to pitch my wife’s amazing Halloween Mother Goose book. https://www.amazon.com/Mother-Ghost-Nursery-Rhymes- Monsters/dp/1585363928/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=mother+ghost&qid=1613492770&sr=8-1 On the topic of kid stuff, I did a guide to running a more young player friendly version of Curse of Strahd with guidelines on horror-themed games for young players (ages 8-12) called “Strahd gives me Goosebumps.” It can be useful for running with adults if you have some players who are not comfortable with all the child murder. https://www.dmsguild.com/product/348639/Strahd-Gives-Me-Goosebumps?view_as_pub=1 Speaking of Curse of Strahd I’ve also got a re-write of Death House for Curse of Strahd on the DMs guild. It’s made to be a better introduction for new players. It’s a totally new, tighter, less lethal ghost story (the chambermaid is the stepmother is the murderer is the boss ghost, no cult, no dungeon) with ghost PC rules and resurrection at the end. https://www.dmsguild.com/product/311769/Another-Death-Another-House Happy Gaming! 6 Medium undead, Neutral Evil Armor Class 16 Hit Points 65 (10d8+20) Speed 30 ft.
