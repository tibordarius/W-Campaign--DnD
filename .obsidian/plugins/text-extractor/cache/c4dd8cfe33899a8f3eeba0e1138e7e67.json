Though the dwarf knows the closest town is weeks away, he has full confidence in the quality of his wares. Smelling profits on the wind, he ventures ever forward, seeking riches and glory for his clan. In the midst of a bustling market, a mousy female halfling with round, thick glasses scribbles away within a tome. Beside her lies a pile of her completed works, finely bound, proclaiming their titles in bold lettering. Concerned only with her writing, the halfling pays no heed to attracting customers, trusting that her books and reputation will be more than enough to entice passersby. Set against the edge of an alleyway, a male kobold clad only in a burlap sack waves his arms and chitters franti- cally, attempting to attract buyers. The kobold eventually gives up, sighing, glancing over towards his nearby pile of identical burlap sacks, complete with arm and head holes. No buyers today - but tomorrow, who knows? Though few of their ilk consider it, adventurers are far from being the only individuals enterprising and foolhardy enough to journey the wider world in search of fortune and glory. Merchants travel far and wide, often finding themselves at bustling hubs of business, such as port towns, trade hubs, and the more mercantile strongholds that pepper the disparate reaches of the world. Each merchant has their own motivations for and methods of pursuing free enterprise, and for every merchant just trying to get by, there’s at least one more with fervent dreams of someday, somehow, making it big and retiring to comfort and fortune. Included here are sample merchant inventories for the merchants that traverse the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. This supplement is designed to work with the Fortresses, Temples, & Strongholds option available from Walrock Homebrew on the DM’s Guild, though these merchants can function equally well when found throughout the wider world. W Traders & Merchants 5 Merchant Characteristics Much like adventurers themselves, merchants often have hopes, dreams, and fatal flaws of their own. If you wish to characterize a merchant for roleplaying purpos- es, roll on or choose from the following tables. d8 Personality Trait 1 I greet absolutely everyone with a warm hug. 2 I have a much better head for numbers than people. 3 I’m sometimes willing to barter in favors than coin. 4 I don’t trust adventurers, not even a little bit. 5 It’s all business with me, no need to be personable. 6 Repeat customers are my best friends. 7 I’ll talk all day, until your ears fall off. 8 I’m convinced my natural showmanship is what earns me customers. d6 Ideal 1 Commerce. Free exchange is the world’s greatest equalizer. (Lawful) 2 Monopoly. Undercutting my rivals and price gouging are the only ways to get ahead. (Evil) 3 Salesmanship. I’ll sell absolutely anything. My horse, my mother, everything has a price. (Chaotic) 4 Charity. I try to give discounts or handouts to those that are truly in need. (Good) 5 Finality. No refunds. Ever. (Any) 6 Enjoyment. Buying and selling wares is all a big game to me, one that I love playing. (Any) d6 Bond 1 I have a sick relative that my business supports. 2 I owe a lot of money to organized crime, and they’re threatening to collect. Violently. 3 I’m counting down the days to a peaceful retirement with my spouse or loved ones. 4 I hope to earn enough money to be able to pursue my true love, who is well above my station. 5 I’m on the run from the law, and plan to leave town before they finally recognize me. 6 A large portion of my money is spent atoning for my shameful past. d6 Flaw 1 Most of my money is spent every night in the tavern. 2 I have no real faith in the quality of my merchandise, whether or not it is actually good. 3 If someone undercuts my prices, I’ll cut their throat. 4 I counterfeit currency on the side, and slip it in with the change I give customers. 5 I never, ever, ever know when to quit, and I refuse to lose a sale. 6 It’s hard for me to respect someone who doesn’t know everything about what I’m selling. Gimmick Some merchants develop a gimmick: a market- able eccentricity that makes them memorable in an otherwise very competitive field. If you wish for a merchant to have a gimmick, roll or choose one on the following table. d10 Gimmick 1 Every purchase comes with a complementary mug of ale! Drunk customers are good customers! 2 I AM ALWAYS VERY EXCITED ABOUT MY PRODUCTS, AND SHOUT TO CONVEY MY ENTHUSIASM! 3 I talk so fast, you’ll never have time to think. 4 Banners! Bright colors! A local bard! My shop has it all. 5 I’ve designed and assembled a mascot costume to attract business, or to scare children. Could be both. 6 I perform (mundane) magic tricks to keep my customers interested. 7 My shop is set up to look like it belongs in an entirely different biome or part of the world. 8 I try to attract local artists, to make my shop a popular and happening place to be. 9 I try to make myself and my shop look very mysterious and hidden, even though we are neither. 10 I have a ludicrous catchphrase I use as often as possible. 6 Merchants & Merchandise Merchants sometimes come from distant lands bearing exotic wares, and have wildly different specialties. Even within a specialty, merchants are of dramatically differ- ent quality depending on the materials they can acquire, and their skill at the art of commerce. When you require a merchant, you can create one by rolling on the tables in the Merchants and Traders section of Fortresses, Temples, and Strongholds, or by rolling on the table presented here: Merchant specialty d100 Merchants 1-5 Alcohol and refreshment 6-9 Animals 10-13 Books and maps (mundane) 14-17 Flowers and seeds 18-22 Food and animal products 23-26 Furniture and interior decor 27-31 High fashion 32-35 Jewelry and gems 36-40 Knick-knacks 41-45 Leatherworking 46-49 Mechanical contraptions 50-54 Medium and heavy armor 55-58 Potions, poisons, and herbs 59-62 Religions idols and blessings 63-66 Songs and instruments 67-70 Spell scrolls and tomes 71-74 Tattoos 75-78 Thieving supplies 79-83 Tools 84-87 Vehicles and transportation 88-92 Weapons 93-96 Witchcraft 97-100 Legendary merchant (roll once on the Legendary Merchants table) Legendary Merchants If a Legendary Merchant is rolled on the Merchants table, roll once on the following table to determine which Legendary Merchant your players encounter: d20 Legendary Merchants 1-2 Astral traveler 3-6 Enchantments 7 Fey bargains 8-11 Magic items 12-14 Magical creatures 15-18 Necromancy 19 Needful things 20 Time-lost Merchant Quality Whenever you roll or choose a merchant, roll on the Quality table, below, to determine the quality of their goods. Legendary merchants do not exist below medium quality, and their quality should be rerolled until it is medium or higher. d20 Quality Currency On-Hand 1-2 Atrocious 1d10 × 20 gp 3-6 Poor 1d10 × 50 gp 7-12 Medium 1d10 × 100 gp 13-17 Good 1d10 × 250 gp 18-20 Excellent 1d10 × 500 gp Merchants carry goods on their respective list that belong to their quality or lesser. This means that a medium Jewelry merchant would be able to dispense items available to a poor or atrocious Jewelry merchant, but a good High Fashion merchant would be unable to dispense excellent quality items on their inventory list. the inVisible hand at Work Some areas are exceptionally good (or poor) locations in which to find merchants. The intersection of two major trade routes can yield merchants of a much higher quality than a forgotten outpost deep in the borderlands. If an area is exceptionally good for trade, your DM may choose to roll twice on the Quality table, and use the best result. If an area is ill-suited to commerce, however, the DM may like- wise decide to roll twice and use the worst result, instead. subject to aVailability Many different types of merchants are listed here, and not all merchants are appropriate to every setting. A magic items merchant might be illogical for a setting where magic items are too rare to be sold, or a mechanical contraptions merchant may be at odds with a setting that has yet to discover clockwork. If a thematically inappropriate merchant is rolled (or chosen) on these tables, simply reroll (or choose again) until a more appropriate merchant is selected. In the case of legendary merchants, roll again on the legendary merchants table, unless none of the available legendary merchants would be thematically acceptable. 7 Buying and Selling Whether scrupulous or unscrupulous, merchants tend to obey certain rules when trading. Below are general rules that merchants follow, though your DM may alter these rules to suit their campaign or the predilections of an individual merchant. Selling to Merchants Merchants may be willing to buy items the players wish to sell, usually those that are of and good make and similar enough to the items the merchant already carries. Merchants often are willing to pay half the ordinary price for wares the players are selling, except- ing magic items, which obey their own special rules (see below). Currency carried by merchants for such purposes is typically is kept in a secure location, such as a trapped lockbox. Bartering Some merchants, particularly those in remote areas or belonging to societies without an emphasis on coin- age or currency, may be willing to partake of barter for items in their inventories, exchanging items for items rather than coin. In this case, a merchant will usually attempt to trade as evenly as possible, but will never accept items worth less than what the purchaser is receiving. A merchant may append a 10% convenience fee onto the sale when bartering, or 25% in areas where bartering is less common. Haggling Depending on the individual merchant, a customer haggling and attempting to get the merchant to lower prices may be fully expected, allowed as an occasional indulgence, or seen as a grave insult. Your DM might decide that some merchants are willing to haggle. If so, your DM can roll 1d100 to determine a merchant’s willingness to haggle on the table below. d100 Willingness to Haggle DC Discount 1-25 My prices are set in stone. — — 26-50 Only if I really, really like you. 25 10% 51-75 I’m reasonably flexible with prices. 18 15% 76-85 I’m known for cutting good deals! 15 20% 86-95 Deals so good, it’s suspicious. 13 25% 96-100 Everything must go! No questions! 11 30% If a merchant is willing to haggle on a result of 26 or higher, a character buying an item can attempt a check to haggle with Charisma (Persuasion) against the listed DC associated with the merchant’s level of willingness. On a success, the merchant offers their listed discount on the item the character is buying. If a character attempts this check on a merchant unwilling to haggle, the check fails, regardless of result. Your DM may decide that only one single haggling check is necessary for all items a character is purchas- ing from a merchant, or may require a haggling check for each type of item a character buys. In this latter case, as an example, a character buying one candle and two sheets of paper would make two haggling checks (one for the candle and one for both sheets of paper) rath- er than three. Magic Items Many of the listed merchants, especially legendary merchants or those of good or excellent quality, have magic items in their inventories. Buying Magic Items from Merchants. Depending on how common magic is in your world, your DM may decide that merchants do not or cannot sell magic items. If magic items are not sold in your world, ignore the presence of magic items in merchant inventories. Your DM might also decide that magic items are available for purchase, but are rare enough that they must be located from an interested seller first. In this case, remove magic items from merchant inventories and instead use the rules in the Buying a Magic Item section on page 125 of Xanathar’s Guide to Everything to determine whether or not you are able to find the item you want. Selling Magic Items to Merchants. Your DM may allow you to sell magic items directly to merchants, using the listed prices on page 130 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. It should be noted that no merchant will ever have enough currency on-hand to buy a magic item above rare quality, though a savvy merchant may have reserves or be willing to barter in such a deal. Alternatively, your DM might rule that merchants cannot or will not buy magic items in this fashion. If this is the case, your DM may decide to use the rules for selling magic items present on pages 129-130 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, requiring a greater investment in time and money to find an interested buyer. Goods and Services Being able and willing to provide goods and services is what makes a merchant a merchant. The rules in this section help determine what a merchant has on-hand, and what they are willing to part with. Availability Most merchants have incredibly robust lists of goods that may be available to them, but not every item on a merchant’s list is in their inventory. To determine how many types of items a merchant has available in a given quality category, roll 1d8 + 4 one time for each quality category the merchant has access to. For example, a medium quality merchant would have access to items in the atrocious, poor, and good quality categories, and thus should roll 1d8 + 4 three sepa- rate times. If any of the merchant’s quality categories have five or fewer items, do not roll for that category, and instead include all items that category has to offer (unless otherwise specified). 8 The result of these rolls determine how many types of item a merchant has in each quality category. The DM then selects which types of items the merchant has available, until the available types of items for each qual- ity category equals the result of that category’s roll, or there are no more items of the given quality to select. Usually, a merchant’s stock changes after 30 days. When this happens, your DM should reroll for item availability, and select which type of items the merchant now has in stock. Quantities Each item in a merchant’s inventory has a quantity asso- ciated with it. If an item is available, this is the quantity of that item the merchant has to sell. In most cases, these quantities are rerolled and replenished every 30 days, representing sales and changes in stock. If an item has a minus in its quantity (for example, 1d4 – 2), there may be none of that item present, and the minimum quantity for such items is 0. There are also special listings for quantity, as follows: Made to Order. Some items are not physically avail- able in a merchant’s shop at all, except perhaps as an example for demonstration purposes. An item listed as Made to Order is purchased before it is made, and once purchased takes a number of days to be completed equal to its gold cost divided by 10 (round up). Details specific to the item can be decided upon between the purchaser and merchant at the time of the item’s sale. Once completed, the purchaser usually must retrieve the item from the merchant. Larger items are usually assembled on-site and do not need to be retrieved, and most Good or Excellent merchants are willing to deliver smaller items directly to their clientele. Only 1, Ever. Unlike other items on a merchant’s table, items with this quantity do not restock after 30 days. Once an item listed as such is purchased (whether by a player character or an NPC), it is gone from the merchant’s inventory permanently. Merchants and Spells Some merchants are able to cast spells for your benefit, in return for currency. Any specific merchant can only cast 3 spells per day, regardless of their spell level. A merchant is considered to have a spell attack modifier of +5, and a spell save DC of 13. For the purposes of availability (and rolling to deter- mine if types of items are available), spells are treated as if they were items. As such, certain merchants may not know some spells in their listed inventory, or simply may not have them prepared on a given day. Variant Merchants No two merchants are ever exactly alike, and variant merchants epitomize this. Certain merchant specialties include a sidebar with special rules for retrofitting them into a different type of merchant as a variant, which your DM may choose to do if that merchant is rolled. Often, variant merchants combine inventories between two different merchant specialties. If a variant merchant’s rules instruct you to do so, combine these inventories before determining availability. Reoccurring Merchants Twists of fate and circumstance, as well as convenient trade routes, can bring certain specific merchants into repeated contact with a party of adventurers. Over time, reoccurring merchants might become more (or less) willing to haggle, as they become closer friends (or more contentious enemies) with the player characters. Consider how the party’s relationship with a reoccurring merchant evolves, and what the merchant might ask of repeat customers and potential allies. Items and Sources Most items in merchant inventories have a listed source, denoting the book and page number in which they are found. Sources have varying levels of information on their associated items, ranging from mere citations to broad descriptions of an item’s abilities and powers. If an item is listed without an associated source, it is an entirely new creation for this supplement. Sources are abbreviated, and the full name of any particular source can be found on the following table: source index Abbreviation Source BGDIA Baldur’s Gate: Descent Into Avernus CS Curse of Strahd DMG Dungeon Master’s Guide ERLW Eberron: Rising from the Last War GGR Guildmaster’s Guide to Ravnica GS Ghosts of Saltmarsh HDQ Hoard of the Dragon Queen IDRF Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden LMP Lost Mine of Phandelver MM Monster Manual MOT Mythic Odysseys of Theros OA Out of the Abyss PA Princes of the Apocalypse PHB Player’s Handbook RT The Rise of Tiamat SCAG Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide SKT Storm King’s Thunder TA Tomb of Annihilation TCE Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything TT Teas and Tisanes (DM’s Guild) TYP Tales from the Yawning Portal VGM Volo’s Guide to Monsters WDH Waterdeep: Dragon Heist WDMM Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage XGE Xanathar’s Guide to Everything Your DM may choose to omit items from certain sources, selecting other items in their stead. 910 Merchant Inventories Included in this section are the inventories of various types of merchant, divided by a merchant’s specialty. Alcohol and Refreshment A dusky tavern reverberates with raucous laughter and the clink of mugs raised in a toast. A stoic female dragonborn tavernkeep looks on, polishing an obligatory mug, her eyes searching for signs of trouble. Nearby ale barrels stacked higher than herself, a female dwarf tends to a roadside stall, cleaning her countertop with a grungy dishrag. Colorful flags flap aimlessly in the breeze as she awaits weary, thirsty travelers. A staple of civilization, some theorize that alcohol is what motivated early societies to pursue large-scale agriculture. Merchants that deal in alcohol and other beverages continue this proud tradition, crafting person- alized brews for discerning palates. Sometimes, merchants with this specialty do not or cannot offer certain items due to geography, availabil- ity, or the merchant’s own predilections. As examples, coffee or rum may not exist without a tropical region to foster their creation, or a trade route to the same. Simi- larly, a dwarven brewer may not be willing to carry fancy, fine wines, while a high elf wine aficionado may turn up their nose at the thought of selling ale. Some merchants of this specialty even eschew selling alcohol entirely, focusing on the other forms of refreshment listed here. In most cases, merchants with this specialty of medium quality and above refuse to sell inferior ale, considering the substance to be below their standards.EkatErina Glazkova alcohol and refreshMent Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Ale, inferior 2 cp / mug 1d4 × 100 mugs — Flavor will not leave mouth until after next short rest Water 1 cp / cup 1d4 × 100 cups — Clean and pure Poor Ale, generic 4 cp / mug 1d4 × 100 mugs PHB 158 Whatever ale the merchant has on-hand Ale, non-alcoholic 3 cp / mug 1d4 × 50 mugs — It has (some) flavor, but that’s about it Flask or tankard 2 cp 1d4 × 15 PHB 150 Made of either pewter or treated wood Tea, sandberry 5 cp / cup 1d4 × 10 cups TT Harsh, bitter, and acidic; very hydrating Tea, talktuth 5 cp / cup 1d4 × 5 cups TT Metallic-tasting and slate grey; an acquired taste Medium Ale, Bitter Black 1 sp / mug 1d4 × 50 mugs — Stout; rich, bitter, and heavy, served ice-cold Ale, Elminster’s Choice 8 cp / mug 1d4 × 50 mugs — Dark ale; smoky taste, named as a marketing gimmick Ale, Golden Sands 8 cp / mug 1d4 × 50 mugs — Lager; golden-colored with an aftertaste of citrus Ale, Iriaeboran North 6 cp / mug 1d4 × 100 mugs — Amber ale; harsh and bitter, a truly acquired taste Brewer’s supplies 20 gp 1d4 PHB 154 — Cider, Knee-cracker 8 cp / mug 1d4 × 100 mugs — Hard apple; cloudy with a strong sweet-sour taste Juice, fruit 3 cp / mug 1d4 × 25 cups — Of any variety Mead, common 1 sp / mug 1d4 × 100 mugs — A popular spiced honey wine Milk 1 sp / bottle 1d4 × 5 bottles — Goat, cow, or other Moonshine 3 sp / bottle 1d4 × 5 bottles — Disadv. on saves to avoid intoxication Tea, avlat 1 sp / cup 1d4 × 10 cups TT A peppery, copper-colored tisane Tea, blackthorn 1 sp / cup 1d4 × 10 cups TT A savory, earthy tisane that calms an upset stomach Tea, gaeth’ad 5 sp / cup 1d4 × 5 cups TT Thick and brackish, can be mildly psychoactive Tea, vauge 5 cp / cup 1d4 × 10 cups TT Grassy and slightly salty, a mellow-tasting tisane Tea, yellowleaf 1 sp / cup 1d4 × 10 cups TT Robust and pale yellow, can remove clothing stains Wine, Blood Wine 1 gp / bottle 1d4 × 3 bottles — Red; lush, full taste with bite; favored by necromancers Wine, common 5 sp / bottle 1d4 × 5 bottles PHB 158 One of many other varieties of simple, cheap wine Wine, Fire Wine 7 sp / bottle 1d4 × 3 bottles — Red; very strong and spicy, popular with commoners 11 Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Yeast 4 cp / lb. 1d4 × 2 lbs. — — Good Ale, Dragon’s Breath 2 sp / mug 1d4 × 25 mugs — Imperial ale; powerfully alcoholic, strong hoppy flavor Ale, Luiren’s Best 3 sp / mug 1d4 × 25 mugs — Imperial stout; black, thick, and sweet halfling brew Ale, Old One’s Eye 2 sp / mug 1d4 × 25 mugs — Red ale; pepper and spices give it a prickly aftertaste Ale, Shadowdark 8 cp / mug 1d4 × 50 mugs — Brown ale; a full malty taste; popular in many taverns Bead of refreshment 50 gp 1d4 × 2 XGE 136 — Brandy 5 gp / bottle 1d4 × 2 bottles — — Brew, desmodu 1 sp / mug 1d4 × 25 mugs — An Underdark favorite; served with a live nightcrawler Cider, Purple Hill 2 sp / mug 1d4 × 50 mugs — Hard apple, cherry, plum, and gooseberry blend Cider, Vilhon 2 sp / mug 1d4 × 50 mugs — Hot hard apple, cherry, and pear; with cinnamon Cocoa, hot 5 gp / cup 1d4 × 10 cups TT — Mead, tej 3 sp / mug 1d4 × 50 mugs TA 32 An imported mead made with jungle spices Rum 8 gp / bottle 1d4 × 2 bottles — — Tankard of sobriety 100 gp Only 1, ever XGE 139 — Tea, blackroot tal 1 sp / cup 1d4 × 10 cups TT Bitter cinnamon taste, served hot with honey Tea, chalthorn 2 sp / cup 1d4 × 10 cups TT Dry and chalky, makes you unable to taste spicy food Tea, earth dragon’s eye 6 cp / cup 1d4 × 5 cups TT Black tea; increases movement speed by 5 ft. for 1 hr.

Though a casual onlooker would never guess, the gnome holds a calm confidence that his horses are of the highest caliber. Cages and crates punctured with small holes line a wood elf’s stand on a busy market street. An impos- ing hawk on his arm, passers-by can barely hear the soft cheeping of hawk chicks over the roar of the marketplace. Animal merchants specialize in selling mounts and companions from near and far. Merchants of this specialty often stick within a theme with the animals they sell, such as: tiny pets, livestock, wild beasts, avians, mounts, or similar. No merchants aside from those of atrocious quality are willing to sell a dead animal. Untamed Animals. Sold animals are usually tame, but may not be, if marked otherwise. Untamed animals may require Animal Handling checks to interact with them favorably, usually with a DC of 10 or 15 depending on the task demanded of them. aniMals Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Dog, wild 25 gp 1d4 – 1 TA 96 Untamed, somehow Parrot, dead 1 cp Only 1, ever — Deceased Poor Bat 2 cp 1d4 – 1 MM 318 — Cat 2 sp 1d4 – 1 MM 320 — Chicken 2 cp 1d4 × 2 PHB 157 May instead be a rooster Feed, animal 5 cp / day 1d4 × 30 days PHB 157 — Frog 1 cp 1d4 – 1 MM 322 May instead be a toad Goat 2 gp 1d4 × 2 MM 330 May instead be a sheep (SKT 142) or mountain goat (IDRF 304) Lizard 1 cp 1d4 – 1 MM 332 — Pig 3 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 157 — Rat 1 cp 1d4 MM 335 — Misc.

To tame an untamed creature, you must take a short or long rest in its company once each day, making a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check at the end of that rest. The initial DC for this check is 20, and the DC for each subsequent check is 20 – half the number of successful checks you’ve made + the number of consecutive days you’ve gone without making this check (maxi- mum 10). Placing the creature under the animal friendship spell does not decrease this DC, but instead grants you advantage on the check due to the charmed condition. Once the DC for this check is below 10, the creature is considered tamed, and regards you as a trusted friend. At this point, it is no longer necessary to make this check, though intentional mistreatment of the creature may (at your DM’s discretion) once again cause this check to become necessary. 14 Books and Maps Shelves upon shelves of tomes line the walls of an old wooden scriptorium, and in the center of it all sits an improbably calm half-orc. As the aged scriptorium door creaks open, the half-orc adjusts his spectacles, staring into the bright daylight at those entering his shop. With maps rolled and scrolled bristling from her backpack, a half-elf smiles cheerfully as she waves down travelers. One of the best cartographers in the land, she strides forward full of confidence, knowing that no matter where they are headed, anyone passing this busy crossroad could use one of her maps. Not all books are magical, and indeed most are not. Books are always valuable, however, signifying a substantial amount of effort on the part of authors and transcribers across multiple ages. The same holds true for maps, and both are effective tools to ensure that the vital knowledge and stories of the past are never forgotten. Some merchants with this specialty distribute maps or books exclusively, though many dabble in both. Often, these merchants are authors, cartographers, scribes or transcribers themselves, and turn to selling their wares personally as a method of building reputation and fame within their craft. The prices listed here assume the merchant exists in a world where wide-spread use of such technologies as the printing press and movable type do not exist. Should the merchant and others have access to a printing press, your DM may decide to reduce the prices of applicable items (such as books or maps) by 25%, signifying the relative ease of use of these technologies, and their impact on production and distribution. Your DM may also decide that newspapers cannot exist in settings without a printing press or equivalent technology, and thus cannot be for sale. Books. Some books pertain to specific topics, such as herbalism, heraldry, theology, or armor making. When making a check to recount knowledge on a topic a book in your possession holds, you can choose to take one minute to flip through the book for pertinent informa- tion. If you do, you gain advantage on the check. You can only gain advantage in this way once, and you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again. books and Maps Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Book, lunatic ravings 25 gp 1d4 – 1 DMG 301 Full of mad scribblings, nearly impossible to make out Treasure map, fake 1 sp Only 1, ever — A DC 10 Investigation or History check reveals it is fake Poor Book, grammar 25 gp 1d4 DMG 301 Seems fancy, but is functionally useless Book, mathematics 25 gp 1d4 DMG 301 Teaches everything from the basics to calculus Book, worn diary 25 gp 1d4 – 2 DMG 301 Someone’s personal diary; might be important?

In the crook of her arm lies a basket of fresh-picked wildflowers, a small taste of country living that she sells for but a few pieces of copper. A male dragonborn, dark in scale and countenance, levels his draconic glare at those avoiding his flower shop. Surrounded by bushels of colorful flowers arranged in hanging woven baskets, the dragonborn scowls, wondering why sales have been so surpris- ingly abysmal. Flowers represent light, life, and love in a variety of cultures, and merchants across many lands sell beau- tiful floral arrangements symbolizing anything from a new, springtime romance to a loss most solemn and tragic. Many of these merchants dabble (or fully specialize) in other botanicals, such as trees or crops, and carry with them precious seeds used to grow all manner of plants. Dragon Lily. These beautiful lilies grow in the slow moving water found in shallow ponds and streams, and consume the impurities found in their natural environ- ment. Though they naturally go through this process gradually, once picked a dragon lily goes into a shock of sorts, seeking additional nutrition to heal. Placed in up to 10 gallons of water, a picked dragon lily will instantly consume any impurities within once before fully dying, rendering the water safe to drink. Phoenixbloom. Burning softly and emitting a gentle fragrance like incense, phoenixbloom flowers burn eternally, giving off bright light in a radius of 20 feet, and dim light for 20 feet after that. Any creature that comes into contact with the flaming blossoms, either through an attack or by failing a Dexterity saving throw when walking through a grove of phoenixbloom, takes 1d4 fire damage. Seeds. Found in various shapes and sizes, these seeds require fertile land to grow, and your DM is the ultimate source on whether or not a plot of land can sustain plant life. Crop and flower seeds require 100 consecutive days of maintenance to mature fully, while trees require 1,800 days to begin producing seeds and fruit. A handful of crop or flower seeds can fill four 5-foot by 5-foot squares with their associated plant. The space a tree takes up varies greatly, depending on the type of tree and its age. Powderpuff. These highly-poisonous, small white blooms grow wild in polar regions.

An adjacent creature can use an action to rouse the unconscious creature. Once a powderpuff imparts this poison, it withers and dries into a useless husk. Whistleweed. This long, foxtail-like grass sings out a high-pitched tone when even a small amount of wind brushes it. Often, small bunches of this weed are dried and hung in caves or hallways to provide an early warning of intruders. Creatures attempting a Dexterity (Stealth) check while brushing against whistleweed do so with disadvantage.

With a series of repetitive strikes, he brings the cleaver down, slicing the meat with an exquisite thinness, beginning to prepare a meal. Warming herself near a roadside campfire, a halfling clad in leathers carefully lowers a pot onto the flame. As it rises to a rolling boil, she adds a handful of foraged spices before tossing in a chunk of venison, caught by one of her traps. As the meat stews, she keeps a wary eye for travelers, especially those willing to exchange coin for food. Merchants of this specialty often either make their food themselves, or sell food prepared by another chef in their employ. Highly likely to further special- ize in making specific types or cultures of food, these merchants, when good quality or higher, tend to perceive their craft as an art form. As such, if the merchant is of a high enough quality, they are reticent to sell meals infe- rior to the best that they can make, and typically refuse to sell all but the rarest animal byproducts. Meals and Days. As outlined on page 185 of the Player’s Handbook, each day an adventurer needs to eat at least 1 lb. of food or suffer a level of exhaustion. Eating only 1/2 lb. of food in a day counts as half a day without food for this purpose. Each food item on this merchant’s table is noted with the amount of days a single unit of it can sustain a creature for. Eating 1 day’s worth of food is the same as eating 1 lb. for the purpose of staving off exhaustion, just as eating a 1/2 day of food by itself is the same as eating only 1/2 lb. of food. Eating only 1/4 day of food does nothing to stop from gaining exhaustion, though fractional days of food are cumulative on the same day.GEkata1989 food and aniMal products Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Dung 1 cp / lb. 1d4 × 25 lbs. — — Lard 2 cp / lb. 1d4 × 25 lbs. — 1/4 day Meal, squalid 3 cp / day 1d4 × 20 days PHB 158 Ripe, rancid, the wrong kind of chewy; 1 day Teeth 1 cp / each 1d4 × 30 — Either animal or (possibly) human Poor Bread 2 cp / loaf 1d4 × 10 loaves PHB 158 1/4 day Butter 3 cp / stick 1d4 × 10 sticks — — Cheese 1 sp / hunk 1d4 × 20 hunks PHB 158 Many different kinds; 1/4 day Eggs 1 sp / dozen 1d4 × 5 dozen — Chicken, duck, or similar; 1/4 day Flour 2 cp / lb. 1d4 × 10 lbs.

Inspiration strikes and she raises the brush, applying paint to canvas, sculpting a pastoral scene in the Feywild to add to the staggering collection of art adorning the walls of her shop. In a black, tight-fitted tunic and wearing eccentric angular glasses, a mustachioed gnome observes the space before him. It takes him but a moment to conclude as to what this area needs to make it whole and vibrant. Now, he thinks, to sell its owners on the idea of an indoor fountain. Artists, designers, and art-sellers, these merchants are often artisans of their given trade. Each work that passes through their hands is personal, in a way, and these merchants would be more than happy to inform buyers of the history and work that goes into what they’re buying.

Around her are mannequins clothed in all manner of finery, domestic and exotic, showing visitors the range and scope of the halfling’s talents. Pulling a soft rabbit-hide off the drying rack, a male wood elf selects a shining pair of silver shears and begins to cut the pelt down to size. As he works with scissor, fur, needle and thread, his deft fingers gradually form a warm winter hat, suitable for the most refined of lords seeking to hunt or journey in the snow. Creating and selling clothes fit for all levels of soci- ety, merchants with this specialty usually sell most of the items available to their quality. Merchants in this specialty often consider themselves artisans (regard- less of their actual skill level), however, and may decline selling articles that they think are below them, or that do not go along with their cultural perspective. A haughty tiefling socialite, for example, would consid- er the selling of commoner’s clothes to depreciate her esteemed reputation, while a down-to-earth dwarven hatmaker might see aristocratic finery as frivolous and functionless. high fashion Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Sack, wearable 1 cp 1d4 × 5 PHB 150 Almost waterproof Poor Cap, leather 5 sp 1d4 × 2 — A sturdy, if ugly, way to keep your head dry Cap, bonnet 5 sp 1d4 × 2 — A feminine working hat Cap, stocking 4 sp 1d4 × 2 — A long, conical cap for a cold winter’s night Cloth, canvas 1 sp / sq. yd. 1d4 × 5 sq. yds.

Though large, the gem is nevertheless found to be of inferior quality. Sighing and setting it aside, the gnome continues to inventory his gemstones, which cover every available surface in his shop. Her pock-marked stone tabletop cluttered with grind- stones, small hammers, and even a tiny anvil, a female dwarf covered in dust and grime casts a small melting pot of steel into a circular mold, setting it shut. As the ring she is molding begins to cool, she hums an old drinking song, ignoring the cluster of children around her stall, watching her work, as she looks for properly interested adults to buy her wares. Merchants with this specialty craft and sell orna- mental pieces of metalwork, as well as the gems such jewelry often includes. These merchants most often sell all items available to their quality or below, but may occasionally further specialize into selling either only gems and raw materials, or only crafted jewelry. These merchants may also custom-make jewelry for your character, built to your specifications. Such jewelry takes a number of days equal to its cost in gp divided by 5 to be fully crafted, whereupon the merchant will either have it ready for your character to pick up, or, if they are good quality or above, be willing to deliver it to a nearby location of your character’s choosing. jeWelry and geMs Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Geode, fake 2 sp 1d4 × 2 — No crystals within this rock.

Like others of her kin, the goblin scrounges for whatever she needs to survive. Unlike the others, however, she often finds it preferable to use passers-by to turn a tidy profit through honest trade, rather than using them as a target for banditry. Sitting on a stool amidst the heaps of junk clutter- ing his shop, a half-orc clad in slacks and a vest waits patiently. He never knows just exactly what he’ll sell to those who walk through his door, but he greats any opportunity to part with a piece of the detritus with an almost disarming enthusiasm. Merchants dealing in knick-knacks sell odd collec- tions of goods not available elsewhere.

Taking great care to properly skin the beast, she then hauls the large, steaming hide back to her village. Travelers always appreciate the craftsman- ship of her goods, and the gold this hide will provide, once cured and crafted, should feed her family all through the winter. His hands threading a needle with expert precision, a tiefling begins to sew ornamental strips of cut leather onto an unfinished saddle. His shop smelling of deep, comfortable musk from the assembled rows of finished leather goods, the tiefling has no doubt that his current work should be done before the end of the week. Leatherworkers sell leather armor, bags, saddles, and other goods to those that require them. Merchants with this specialty sometimes only sell either clothing and armor or containers, but most dabble in all kinds of leathercraft. leatherWorking Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Leather, cured 5 gp / sq. yd. 1d4 × 4 sq. yds. — — Sack 1 cp 1d4 × 3 PHB 150 Holds up to 1 cu. ft., or 30 lbs.

Pulling out a key from one of her apron’s many pockets, she winds the contraption up, before setting it upright on the table. The hand-sized mechani- cal dragon at once whirs, roars, and belches a gout of flame that sets the gnome’s wooden tabletop alight. The gnome cheers gleefully, and applauds her latest work. Trudging along a dusty forest trail, a kobold weighed down by several heavy hunting traps on his belt drags an equally-heavy satchel over his back. Every step causes clanks and clatters, but the kobold pays them no mind. He finds a simple satisfaction in selling his work, as, in his opinion, the world could always use more traps. Merchants that sell mechanical contraptions are tinkers, dabbling in the bleeding edge of clockwork technology. These merchants are more than happy to give (overly) detailed instructions on the proper use of their wares.

His shop only lit by the dim light of molten slag from his forge, he nevertheless looks over his work with a keen eye, studying it closely for any weaknesses or imperfections. Riding an enormous warhorse laden with heavy saddlebags, an armored half-orc rides the trade routes with an eye out for customers. All must learn of her mastery of armorcraft, she thinks, and she will travel the world until her name is held in great renown. Merchants that deal in armor are typically blacksmiths themselves, forging their wares and selling them off to those that need them. These merchants may have a specific predilection that prohibits them from selling certain items, however. A dwarven armor merchant, for example, would be unlikely to sell elven chain, while an elf would be just as unlikely to craft or sell a set of dwarven plate, each considering the other’s craft to be the height of distaste. Similarly, some merchants may trend more towards sell- ing heavy armor, medium armor, or shields, but all tend to have at least a few token offerings of goods outside their particular focus.WaynE EnGland MediuM and heaVy arMor Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Barrel, wearable 2 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 150 Includes straps; does not include top or bottom Bucket 5 cp 1d4 × 2 PHB 150 Anything is armor if you’re foolhardy enough Poor Bar, copper 5 sp / lb. 1d4 × 2 lbs.

To make this merchant a general Blacksmith, combine the inventory of this merchant with that of both the Tools and the Weapons merchant (located later in this supplement), but remove all magic items and crafting materials from this merchant’s combined inventory. The blacksmith is similarly unable to feature tools, weapons, or armor in its inventory that are not made of metal. 34 Potions, Poisons, and Herbs Grinding together her mortar and pestle, a halfling reduces a handful of herbs to powder. As her cauldron begins to boil, smoke pours out the smokestack of her underhill shop, a sign to her loyal customers that new potions are brewing. Dressed in a grey cloak with a bandolier of potions about his waist, a half-elf occupies a corner at a roadside inn, fiddling with an alembic set up on a stone table. The townsfolk know to find him here, and direct adventurous travelers to seek his services. Naturalists or alchemists, these merchants sell potions, poisons, and the supplies to brew them. Merchants of this trade are likely to further specialize, as many are especially adept at brewing poisons, while others have ethical qualms about creating them.david MichaEl BEck potions, poisons, and herbs Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Bottle, glass 2 gp / bottle 1d4 × 25 bottles PHB 150 Empty; holds up to 1 ½ pints Flask 1 cp / flask 1d4 × 50 flasks PHB 150 Empty; holds up to 1 pint Vial 1 gp / vial 1d4 × 50 vials PHB 150 Empty; holds up to 4 oz.

As she tends to her ritual duties in service to her god, she routinely checks on visiting parishioners, making sure their needs are met. The acolytes of her temple are more than happy to share what they have with pilgrims, asking only a modest donation in return. Rapier slung at her side, a cheerful gnome paladin travels between distant cities, dispensing justice and doing good deeds all along the way. Always overjoyed to meet fellow travelers, she sells supplies sacred to her goddess of journeys, making sure no wanderer goes unprotected. Almost always practicing clergy members (or huck- sters pretending at being such), these merchants bolster their respective faiths by dispensing holy wares to those in need. Most items listed here are sold by all merchants with this specialty and the appropriate quality, though merchants of different faiths offer markedly different- looking wares. For example, a candle sold by a priest of Pelor would look different in obvious ways from a candle sold by an (undoubtedly secret) adherent of Vecna. religious idols and blessings Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Alms box 5 cp 1d4 × 3 PHB 151 A box for collecting monetary offerings Candle 1 cp 1d4 × 10 PHB 150 Comes in a variety of colors Poor Amulet 5 gp 1d4 × 7 PHB 150 Holy symbol; a necklace with a symbol of faith Book, holy 5 gp 1d4 × 10 PHB 150 From one of a variety of faiths Chalk 1 cp / piece 1d4 × 10 pieces PHB 150 Comes in a variety of colors Dagger, ritual 2 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 149 Has an oddly curved design Emblem 5 gp 1d4 × 10 PHB 150 Holy symbol; the visage or symbol of a deity Incense 1 sp / block 1d4 × 20 blocks PHB 151 Thick, musky, and pungent Parchment 1 sp / sheet 1d4 × 20 sheets PHB 150 — Reliquary 5 gp 1d4 × 3 PHB 150 Holy symbol; a small box holding a fragment of a relic Spell: Ceremony 60 gp 3 spells / day XGE 151 Performs a holy rite, out of: atonement, bless water, coming of age, dedication, funeral, or wedding Spell: Cure wounds 10 gp 3 spells / day PHB 230 Cast at 1st-level; heals 1 creature for 1d8 + 3 hit points Spell: Identify 20 gp 3 spells / day PHB 252 Reveals the properties of a magic item Medium Censer 55 gp 1d4 + 2 PHB 151 A gilded thurible for burning incense Clothes, robes 1 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 150 Simple, smooth, and clean, with many pockets Clothes, vestments 8 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 151 A ceremonial outfit for a member of a specific clergy Healer’s kit 5 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 150 — Holy water 25 gp / flask 1d4 × 5 flasks PHB 150 — Lamp 5 sp 1d4 × 2 PHB 150 — Oil 1 sp / flask 1d4 × 5 flasks PHB 150 — Quarterstaff 2 sp 1d4 × 2 PHB 148 — Spell: Aid 40 gp 3 spells / day PHB 255 Cast at 2nd-level; up to 3 creatures increase their hit point maximum by 5 for 8 hrs.

To make an Occultist merchant, remove all spells and magic items from this merchant’s inventory, and add the spell, ritual, and protection scrolls (of the appropriate quality) from the Spell Scrolls and Tomes merchant, located later in this supplement. 38 Songs and Instruments Boxes of whittled wooden instruments at his feet, a brightly-clothed half-orc plays proudly on his bagpipes in the center of a crowded market. Though he knows his business isn’t presently booming, he takes comfort that, at the very least, none in the market can possi- bly ignore him. Sitting in a surprisingly cheerful store, a graceful drow carefully strings a lyre with treated spider silk. Though the silk no longer adheres forcefully to what it touches, it is no less durable, making it ideal for its purpose. The drow slowly plucks the lyre’s new strings, filling her shop with a beautiful, mournful tune. Whether they are bards or craftspersons, merchants of this specialty deal in musical instruments and written songs for musicians. Some of these merchants special- ize in selling one particular type of family of instruments or genre of written song, usually one of cultural signifi- cance to the merchant and their people. songs and instruMents Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Sheet music, terrible 1 cp 1d4 copies DMG 301 Discordant, has 11/8 time signature for some reason Thelarr or whistlecane 1 cp 1d4 × 3 SCAG 124 Instrument; incredibly simple, cut from a single reed Poor Bell 1 gp 1d4 × 3 PHB 150 — Drum or hand drum 6 gp 1d4 × 4 PHB 154 Instrument; leather hide over a wooden frame Horn or longhorn 3 gp 1d4 × 3 PHB 154 Instrument; good for playing a few very loud notes Ink 10 gp / bottle 1d4 bottles PHB 150 — Ink pen 2 cp 1d4 × 2 PHB 150 — Paper 2 sp / sheet 1d4 × 5 sheets PHB 150 — Shawm 2 gp 1d4 × 4 PHB 154 Instrument; a long, reeded woodwind with fingerholes Sheet music, derivative 5 cp 1d4 copies DMG 301 Has a popular song’s name crossed out and re-titled Medium Bagpipes 30 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 154 Instrument; a bag for air with protruding pipes Chalumeau 15 gp 1d4 × 3 — Instrument; a reeded woodwind, functional design Cymbals 20 gp / set 1d4 × 3 sets — Instrument; a set of two metal discs, with straps Flute or songhorn 2 gp 1d4 × 4 PHB 154 Instrument; a reedless woodwind of metal or wood Lyre 30 gp 1d4 × 4 PHB 154 Instrument; small, hand-held, and harp-like Pan flute or birdpipes 12 gp 1d4 × 4 PHB 154 Instrument; joined wooden pipes of different lengths Sheet music, catchy 5 sp 1d4 DMG 301 You sometimes find yourself humming snatches of it Strings 4 cp / ea. 1d4 × 5 — Good for restringing a string instrument Timbrel or tantan 13 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 154 Instrument; a wooden hoop with metal discs in it Tocken 8 gp 1d4 × 2 SCAG 124 Instrument; bells favored by underground cultures Wargong 10 gp 1d4 × 2 SCAG 124 Instrument; a large, hanging metal disc, often a shield Good Adufe 10 gp 1d4 × 2 — Instrument; a boxlike, rattling frame drum Dulcimer 25 gp 1d4 × 3 PHB 154 Instrument; flat, with strings plucked, bowed, or struck Glaur 30 gp 1d4 × 2 SCAG 124 Instrument; a curved, valved, brass horn Glockenspiel 35 gp 1d4 × 2 — Instrument; metal bars struck with mallets Gloon 30 gp 1d4 × 2 SCAG 124 Instrument; a mournful, valve-less, curved horn Grand piano 500 gp 1d4 – 1 — Instrument; too big to be easily moved Harp, exotic wood 750 gp Only 1, ever DMG 135 Instrument; carved and inlaid with ivory and zircon gems Harpsichord 350 gp 1d4 – 1 — Instrument; too big to be easily moved 39 Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Horn of silent alarm 100 gp Only 1, ever XGE 137 — Instrument of illusions 100 gp Only 1, ever XGE 137 Can be any kind of instrument Instrument of scribing 100 gp Only 1, ever XGE 138 Can be any kind of instrument Instrument of the bards, Doss lute 500 gp Only 1, ever DMG 176 — Instrument of the bards, Fochlucan bandore 500 gp Only 1, ever DMG 176 — Instrument of the bards, Mac-Fuirmidh cittern 500 gp Only 1, ever DMG 176 — Lute or yarting 35 gp 1d4 × 3 PHB 154 Instrument; with plucked strings and a long neck Pipes of haunting 500 gp Only 1, ever DMG 185 — Pipes of the sewers 500 gp Only 1, ever DMG 185 — Rebab 32 gp 1d4 × 2 — Instrument; very long and narrow, with bowed strings Rhythm-maker’s drum, +1 500 gp Only 1, ever TCE 134 Bard only; regain Bardic Inspiration with an action Sheet music, classic 5 gp 1d4 copies DMG 301 A song everyone knows, and many sing along with Sheet music, inspired 50 gp 1d4 copies DMG 301 A new song, exciting and destined for greatness Viol 30 gp 1d4 × 3 PHB 154 Instrument; bowed, fretted, with a hollow body Wand of conducting 100 gp Only 1, ever XGE 140 — Zulkoon 50 gp 1d4 × 2 SCAG 124 Instrument; a complex and sinister-sounding organ Excellent Bell branch 5,000 gp Only 1, ever TCE 122 Druid/warlock only; detects the presence of creatures Chime of opening 2,500 gp Only 1, ever DMG 158 — Eagle whistle 5,000 gp Only 1, ever TYP 228 Gain flying speed of 2 × move speed, only when blowing Gnomish saxophone 250 gp 1d4 – 1 — Instrument; a reeded brass woodwind, covered in keys Instrument of the bards, Canaith mandolin 5,000 gp Only 1, ever DMG 176 — Instrument of the bards, Cli lyre 5,000 gp Only 1, ever DMG 176 — Lyre of building 5,000 gp Only 1, ever TCE 131 Bard only; has spells, protects structures Sheet music, epic 500 gp Only 1 copy, ever DMG 301 A truly revolutionary piece, will change everything Siren song lyre 5,000 gp Only 1, ever MOT 198 — 40 Spell Scrolls and Tomes Seated adjacent to a near-perfect pyramid of stacked scrolls, a high elf dips his quill in ink and begins to write a new scroll in fluid elvish script. His shop utterly quiet save for the scratching of his pen on parchment, the florid script begins to glow ever so slightly in the dim afternoon light. A male tiefling clad in a large coat and a dusty wizard’s hat stands in a busy marketplace next to a pile of books nearly as tall as he is. The tiefling yells out attempting to attract buyers, but a closer inspection reveals many of the tomes to be chained shut, murmuring worryingly to each other. Selling magical spells is not for the faint of heart, but merchants with this specialty make it a way of life. The tomes and scrolls sold by these merchants each contain certain spells, and a merchant with this special- ty rarely has more than one tome or scroll that casts the same spell. When determining this merchant’s item availability, this merchant can have multiple spells or scrolls of the same level or type. Spell Scrolls. Each of these scrolls contains a specific spell. If that spell is on your class’s spell list, you can use an action to attempt to cast the spell. This requires a check if the spell is of a greater level than you can normally cast. Succeed or fail, the scroll is then destroyed. Wizard spells on spell scrolls can also be copied into spellbooks by characters capable of doing so, but require a check to be copied successfully after the normal expenditure of time and materials. Same as cast- ing a spell with the scroll, succeed or fail, the spell scroll is then destroyed. The DCs for these checks, as well as complete rules for spell scrolls, can be found on page 200 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Ritual Scrolls. These scrolls contain only spells with the ritual tag, and are able to be used by any character that is able to transcribe spells into a spellbook, such as a wizard, a warlock with the Book of Ancient Secrets invocation, or a character with the Ritual Caster feat. The character must still meet all other level, class, or spell level requirements for doing so, as normal. Unlike a spell scroll, the spell in a ritual scroll cannot be cast without first copying it down, but a ritual scroll does not require a check for its spell to be successfully copied, nor is a ritual scroll limited to being a wizard spell if it is to be copied. As with a spell scroll, copying a ritual scroll carries the same cost in time and gp, and a ritual scroll is destroyed after it is copied. spell scrolls and toMes Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Spell scroll, fake 25 sp 1d4 — A DC 10 Investigation check reveals it to be fake Poor Book, blank 25 gp 1d4 × 3 PHB 150 Suitable for writing or drawing; won’t hold spells Calligrapher’s supplies 10 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 154 — Case, scroll 1 gp 1d4 × 5 PHB 150 — Ink 10 gp / bottle 1d4 bottles PHB 150 — Ink pen 2 cp 1d4 × 2 PHB 150 — Paper 2 sp / sheet 1d4 × 20 sheets PHB 150 — Parchment 1 sp / sheet 1d4 × 20 sheets PHB 150 — Spellbook 50 gp 1d4 × 5 PHB 150 Empty; suitable for holding spells Medium Enduring spellbook 100 gp 1d4 XGE 137 Empty; not damaged by fire, water, or age Glow ink 50 gp / bottle 1d4 – 1 bottles — Glows faintly, indefinitely; can be seen in darkness 41 Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Paper, enduring 2 gp / sheet 1d4 × 5 sheets — Not damaged by fire, water, or age Ritual scroll, 1st-level 50 gp 1d4 — Contains a random 1st-level ritual spell, can be copied Ritual scroll, 2nd-level 250 gp 1d4 — Contains a random 2nd-level ritual spell, can be copied Ritual scroll, 3rd-level 250 gp 1d4 — Contains a random 3rd-level ritual spell, can be copied Scroll satchel 100 gp 1d4 – 1 — Holds up to 30 scrolls in an extra-dimensional space; can draw or stow a scroll using a bonus action Spell scroll, cantrip 50 gp 1d4 × 5 DMG 200 Contains a random cantrip, can be copied Spell scroll, 1st-level 50 gp 1d4 × 4 DMG 200 Contains a random 1st-level spell, can be copied Spell scroll, 2nd-level 250 gp 1d4 × 4 DMG 200 Contains a random 2nd-level spell, can be copied Spell scroll, 3rd-level 250 gp 1d4 × 3 DMG 200 Contains a random 3rd-level spell, can be copied Spell: Identify 20 gp 3 spells / day PHB 252 Reveals the properties of a magic item Spell: Illusory script 30 gp 3 spells / day PHB 252 Writes a magically-coded message Spell: Knock 40 gp 3 spells / day PHB 254 Opens a locked object Spell: Mage armor 10 gp 3 spells / day PHB 256 Target’s base AC becomes 13 + its Dex modifier Good Arcane grimoire, +1 500 gp Only 1, ever TCE 120 Wizard only; improves Arcane Recovery Copypaper 50 gp / sheet 1d4 sheets — Press to a piece of non-magical paper: permanently becomes a copy of that paper and is no longer magical Hat of wizardry 100 gp Only 1, ever XGE 137 Wizard only; attempt to cast extra cantrips Paper bird 250 gp 1d4 × 2 WDH 191 Carries a message of up to 50 words to a recipient Paper of folding 100 gp 1d4 – 1 — Action: Can be folded into (or unfolded from) a working replica of any non-magical item that costs 5 gp or less and is held in one hand Quill of scribing 100 gp 1d4 – 1 — Action: Writes (or stops writing) what you say for up to 1 hr. collectively per day Ritual scroll, 4th-level 2,500 gp 1d4 – 1 — Contains a random 1st-level ritual spell, can be copied Ritual scroll, 5th-level 2,500 gp 1d4 – 1 — Contains a random 2nd-level ritual spell, can be copied Ritual scroll, 6th-level 25,000 gp 1d4 – 2 — Contains a random 3rd-level ritual spell, can be copied Scroll of protection, any 2,500 gp 1d4 × 3 DMG 199 Can be used by anyone; protects against a creature type Spell scroll, 4th-level 2,500 gp 1d4 × 3 DMG 200 Contains a random 4th-level spell, can be copied Spell scroll, 5th-level 2,500 gp 1d4 × 2 DMG 200 Contains a random 5th-level spell, can be copied Spell scroll, 6th-level 25,000 gp 1d4 × 2 DMG 200 Contains a random 6th-level spell, can be copied Spell: Legend lore 770 gp 3 spells / day PHB 254 Reveals details about important person, place, or thing Spell: Skywrite 40 gp 3 spells / day XGE 165 Up to 10 words appear in the sky Spell: Tongues 90 gp 3 spells / day PHB 283 Target understands all languages Excellent Backup spellbook 500 gp 1d4 – 1 — Press to a spellbook: permanently becomes a copy of that spellbook and is no longer magical Fulminating treatise 5,000 gp Only 1, ever TCE 128 Wizard only; holds spells, deals more spell damage Heart-weaver’s primer 5,000 gp Only 1, ever TCE 128 Wizard only; holds spells, empowers enchantment Manual of golems, clay 25,000 gp Only 1, ever DMG 280 — Spell scroll, 7th-level 25,000 gp 1d4 – 1 DMG 200 Contains a random 7th-level spell, can be copied Spell scroll, 8th-level 25,000 gp 1d4 – 2 DMG 200 Contains a random 8th-level spell, can be copied 42 Tattoos With deftness in every inch of her gnarled, stubby fingers, a dwarf with one eye and a scar running down her cheek carefully heats a sharp iron needle in a candle flame. Before her are waiting wells of ink, and a fresh- faced male human lying face down, shirtless, expectant, and nervous, upon a weathered wooden table. Scrawling a simple floral design in a sketchbook, a young elf takes time to emphasize its long, stylized, flow- ing lines. Gently closing the book, the elf shelves it in an outer pocket of a pack they are wearing, causing a slight rattle of metal and glass from within. The elf wonders if any will partake of their artistic services in the next town they venture to, and what canvases will await their craft. Often a practice of great cultural or religious signifi- cance, tattooing is also an art form and a method of self expression. Those that take on tattoos wear their art proudly, likely for their entire lives, a testament to their individuality and their artist’s skill. Most tattoo merchants have one or several styles that they can create art in, many of which have roots in cultures or subcultures important to your setting. Consider who an artist is, where they come from, and how these things might influence their style. Magical Tattoos and Removal. Some tattoos created by this merchant are magical, and are applied directly to a recipient rather than sold as an item, contrary to some of their descriptions. Similar to merchants that cast spells, a tattoo merchant can use magic up to three times each day to remove a tattoo or create a magical tattoo. tattoos Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Ink 10 gp / bottle 1d4 bottles PHB 150 Suitable for writing or applying tattoos Ink pen 2 cp 1d4 PHB 150 — Needle 2 cp 1d4 × 50 — Suitable for applying tattoos Tattoo, simple mundane 5 sp Unlimited — Basic shapes and forms; no larger than 1/4 sq. ft.

She trusts her contacts on the street to bring those interested to her, and, so far, that trust has yet to fail her. Hearing a knocking in thieves’ cant reverberate from the mouth of the alley, she knocks out the counter- sign, and unrolls her bundle of wares onto the ground. A halfling with an eyepatch hums to himself as he sets up his wares on the walls of the inside of an open wine barrel in the back of a bar. Satisfied at the items’ arrangement, he takes a seat nearby, pulling a hidden lever. Groaning, the wine barrel mechanically closes its front, appearing whole to the untrained eye. The halfling sips a cup of tea, and awaits customers. Though their business may not (necessarily) be illegal, these merchants work tirelessly to enable criminals, spies, and assassins. Merchants with this specialty (most often) do not attempt to directly swindle customers unless the merchant is of atrocious quality. All merchants value repeat buyers, thieving supplies merchants being no exception, and any merchant knows the surest way to make enemies and lose business is to cheat those who will likely have even more coin for you to earn in the future. thieVing supplies Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Book, “How to Steal” 25 gp Only 1 copy, ever PHB 150 The outside is locked (DC 15), and the inside is blank Pole, 10-foot 5 cp 1d4 × 4 PHB 150 — Sack 1 cp 1d4 × 5 PHB 150 Holds up to 1 cu. ft., or 30 lbs.

The shop smells comfortably of fresh cut lumber. The wood elf yawns, waiting for customers to arrive. A female dwarf, pack mule and wagon in tow, strides casually into town, a pickaxe and shovel over each shoul- der, a lit lantern resting near the head of the pick. The laborers of this hamlet sent out a request for more tools a week back, and the dwarf responded, always ready to earn coin. Craftspeople or mere traders, merchants of this specialty sell tools for all professions along their trade routes. Merchants that sell tools may choose to deal in exclusively tools appropriate for their environment, but many are generalists, crafting tools of every type for any occasion. tools Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Atrocious Bucket 5 cp 1d4 × 2 PHB 150 Holds 3 gal. or ½ cu. ft.

To make this merchant a general Blacksmith, combine the inventory of this merchant with that of both the Medium and Heavy Armor merchant and the Weapons merchant (located later in this supplement), but remove all magic items and crafting materials from this merchant’s combined inventory. The blacksmith is similarly unable to feature tools, weapons, or armor in its inventory that are not made of metal. 48 Vehicles and Transportation Sitting at a table in a dimly-lit wagonhouse, a dwarf with a beard full of sawdust waits patiently for customers to trail in. The smells of horses, hay, and fresh-cut wood waft through his shop, full of carriages and carts, both humble and ornately gilded. The crashing of waves and the squawking of gulls periodically interrupted by the percussive strikes of his hammer, a half-elf in an airy, billowing shirt pounds nails through planks, securing together the hull of a mighty ship. When completed, this vessel will be one of the fleetest to ever sail the seas, a fact the half-elf relent- lessly informs any that will listen. Craftspersons who specialize in transportation, these merchants churn out boats and wheeled vehicles to keep the world in motion. Many of these merchants also offer courier services and transportation for hire, and keep a small staff of hirelings to aid with these endeavors. Vehi- cle and transportation merchants are also very likely to further specialize, and may eschew selling wagons and horses entirely in favor of shipcraft, or dedicate them- selves entirely to land or even air transportation, espe- cially if there are no large bodies of water nearby.

If you wish to make this merchant an Explorer instead, remove everything from its inventory but one of the following options: methods of air travel, methods of sea travel, or meth- ods of land travel (and accessories such as saddles and animal feed). Then, add maps, charts, map-making tools, and similar of appropriate quality from the Books and Maps merchant. 50 Weapons An impossibly burly, scarred halfling presides over a remarkably odd shop. Weapon racks line the periphery, circling entirely around a large ring of honor carved into the center of the floor. The halfling proprietor encour- ages customers to test the products first-hand, sparring or squaring off against wooden training dummies. Two long steel swords slung across her back, a red-scaled dragonborn boldly challenges all comers to combat in her corner of the marketplace. Exhibiting the prowess and power of her weapons, she earns both customers and a fan following through her practical demonstrations. Fighters or forgemasters, merchants of this specialty sell weapons of great offensive power. Some of these merchants seek to profit from the necessities of war, while others are idealists, promoting peace through protection. Still others are retired adventurers, knowing the hardships and threats that exist in the wider world all too well, and providing reliable protection against the dangers other adventurers may encounter.

To make this merchant a general Blacksmith, combine the inventory of this merchant with that of both the Medium and Heavy Armor merchant and the Tools merchant, but remove all magic items and crafting materials from this merchant’s combined inventory. The blacksmith is similarly unable to feature tools, weapons, or armor in its inventory that are not made of metal. 51 Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Halberd 20 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 149 1d10 slashing; heavy, reach, two-handed Lance 10 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 149 1d12 piercing; reach, special Longbow 50 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 149 1d8 piercing; ranged (150/600), heavy, two-handed Longsword 15 gp 1d4 × 3 PHB 149 1d8 slashing; versatile (1d10) Maul 10 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 149 2d6 bludgeoning; heavy, two-handed Morningstar 15 gp 1d4 × 3 PHB 149 1d8 piercing Net 1 gp 1d4 PHB 149 Special, thrown (5/15) Pike 5 gp 1d4 × 3 PHB 149 1d10 piercing; heavy, reach, two-handed Quiver 1 gp 1d4 PHB 150 Holds up to 20 arrows Rapier 25 gp 1d4 × 3 PHB 149 1d8 piercing; finesse Scimitar 25 gp 1d4 × 3 PHB 149 1d6 slashing; finesse, light Sheath 3 gp 1d4 × 2 — Tooled leather holster for a dagger or sword Shortsword 10 gp 1d4 × 4 PHB 149 1d6 piercing; finesse, light Smith’s tools 20 gp 1d4 PHB 154 — Trident 5 gp 1d4 PHB 149 1d6 piercing; thrown (20/60), versatile (1d8) War pick 5 gp 1d4 PHB 149 1d8 piercing Warhammer 15 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 149 1d8 bludgeoning; versatile (1d10) Whip 2 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 149 1d4 slashing; finesse, reach Yklwa 1 gp 1d4 TA 32 1d8 piercing; thrown (10/30) Good Ammunition, +1 50 gp / ea. 1d4 × 10 DMG 150 Can be any piece of ammunition Chatkcha 2 gp 1d4 MM 288 1d6 slashing; finesse, light, ranged/thrown (30/120) Crossbow, hand 75 gp 1d4 × 2 PHB 149 1d6 piercing; light, loading, ranged (30/120) Crossbow, heavy 50 gp 1d4 PHB 149 1d10 piercing; heavy, loading, two-handed, ranged (100/400) Crossbow, light repeating 150 gp 1d4 – 2 OA 224 1d8 piercing; two-handed, ranged (40/160); has 6 shots, can be reloaded with an action Gythka 40 gp 1d4 – 1 MM 288 1d8 slashing; reach, two-handed Javelin of lightning 500 gp Only 1, ever DMG 178 — Longbow, oversized 150 gp 1d4 – 1 WDH 201 2d6 piercing; heavy, ranged (150/600), two-handed; requires 18 Str, attacks and deals damage with Str in place of Dex Moon-touched sword, any 100 gp* 1d4 – 1 XGE 138 Sheds bright light for 15 feet, dim light 15 feet beyond that; add base cost of the nonmagical weapon to item’s price Scimitar, double-bladed 100 gp 1d4 – 1 ERLW 21 2d4 slashing; special, two-handed Shortspear, hooked 125 gp 1d4 – 1 OA 224 1d4 piercing; light; on hit, can choose not to do damage, instead having target make a Str save (DC 8 + your Str + prof. bonus) or become prone Storm boomerang 500 gp Only 1, ever PA 223 Instead recharges with a short rest Veteran’s cane 100 gp Only 1, ever XGE 139 Bonus action: Transforms into a mundane longsword Walloping ammunition, any 10 gp / ea. 1d4 × 10 XGE 139 A creature hit must succeed a DC 10 Str save or be prone; can be any piece of ammunition Weapon, +1 500 gp* 1d4 – 1 DMG 213 Add base cost of the nonmagical weapon to item’s price Weapon of warning, any 500 gp* 1d4 – 2 DMG 213 Add base cost of the nonmagical weapon to item’s price Excellent Ammunition, +2 500 gp / ea. 1d4 × 10 DMG 150 Can be any piece of ammunition Flame tongue, any 5,000 gp* Only 1, ever DMG 170 Add base cost of the nonmagical weapon to item’s price Frost brand, any 50,000 gp* Only 1, ever DMG 171 Add base cost of the nonmagical weapon to item’s price Oathbow 50,000 gp Only 1, ever DMG 183 — Sword of sharpness, any 50,000 gp* Only 1, ever DMG 206 Add base cost of the nonmagical weapon to item’s price Two-birds sling 5,000 gp Only 1, ever MOT 198 Shots can ricochet between targets Vicious weapon, any 5,000 gp* Only 1, ever DMG 209 Add base cost of the nonmagical weapon to item’s price Weapon, +2 5,000 gp* 1d4 – 2 DMG 213 Add base cost of the nonmagical weapon to item’s price 52 Witchcraft An old woman with silvered hair hums quietly to herself, wielding a mortar and pestle with weathered hands. As she grinds an admixture of herbs into a fine powder, a black iron cauldron behind her begins to boil, waiting to receive the contents of her mortar. Leather-bound book in hand, a male gnome with half- moon spectacles and ebony hair reads on, idly stroking a black cat resting in his lap with his other hand. A cup of tea sits beside him on a small table, its steam and floral scent seemingly filling his shop. A staple both in the small towns of the hinterlands and in forgotten alcoves of large cities, practitioners of witchcraft often have wares to sell, to those interested in their arts. Though not as focused on one field as purveyors of drinks, foodstuffs, potions, or other magical wares, merchants in the field of witchcraft dabble wher- ever their interests lie, and as such have a much more generalized selection of wares.

Any Stronghold ability that would allow you to select a merchant cannot be used to select a legendary merchant. Your DM may also decide for you to encounter a legendary merchant under other circum- stances, at their discretion. Astral Traveler An old magus with a trailing grey beard sits at a cross- roads, smoke curling from a long-stemmed pipe. He watches passers-by with eyes bluer than blue, sparkling with a deep, inner magic. Those that look closely with the right kind of sight can see subtle tears in reality around him, a distortion of light and being marking him as here, yet not. The magus ignores questions about his presence, answering them only by blowing a perfect cube of pipe-smoke. A gnome with hair like iron, held in a tight bun by two sharp hairpins, distractedly scrawls in a tome. Most avoid her corner table at the local tavern, though none say why. She periodically checks an odd compass-like device, making appreciative noises and scribbling furi- ously when its needle points in certain directions. An astral traveler has seen more than most beings will in several lifetimes. They have tasted pains and delights belonging to realities far removed from the Prime Mate- rial, and have set foot where both celestials and fiends fear to find themselves. Naturally, an astral traveler has come across plenty of souvenirs in their journeying, and are willing to part with a few of them for the right amount of coin. astral traVeler legendary Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Medium Astral diamond 10,000 gp 1d4 × 10 — Used as a form of currency in many planar locales Bag of holding 500 gp 1d4 × 2 DMG 153 Holds 64 cu. ft., or 500 lbs; always weighs 15 lbs.

Glowing placidly, the thought-form floats before her, ready to be bound into a weapon, empowering it perma- nently with a figment of her magical will. As she works, a cluster of astounded village children and skeptical elders crowd around her roadside stall, but the human is either deep in thought or pretending not to notice. A scruffy male gnome, beard and hair frizzed out in every direction, attends with his set of tinker’s tools to a battle axe laid out before him. His immense scientific mind calculates the energy flow intrinsic to the power- ful weapon, and devises the particular method required for generating a self-sustaining magical current within it. Wiring up the axe to an etheric battery of his own design, the gnome activates it, and the axe begins to hum with a distinctly magical vibration. Legendary merchants that deal in enchantments are by definition a rarity, but a welcome sight in any town they visit. Each merchant has a different method of imbuing the mundane with the magical, but the end result is the same: enhanced weapons, armor, or other items that grant specialized magical abilities. Magical Enchantment. Any nonmagical or already- magical item can be enchanted by this merchant, provid- ed that it is small enough to be easily carried or used by a Medium or smaller creature. Enchanting an item with this merchant requires selecting an existing item a char- acter has on their person, paying the cost associated on the merchant’s inventory table, and either rolling for or selecting the proper enchantment, as the case may be. Any specific item can only be the subject of one enchantment of each quality (minor, major, legendary) from this merchant, and an item with an enchantment applied becomes magical (if it was not so already). Enchanting a single item with an enchantment of the same quality twice causes the first enchantment to be overwritten by the second. Enchantments marked with an (a) cause the enchant- ed item to require attunement before its properties can be used. If a previously-magical item already requiring attunement receives one of these marked enchantments, it is still only necessary to attune to it once. A mundane item affected by a minor enchantment is considered a common magic item. If affected by a major enchantment it is considered an uncommon magic item, or a rare magic item if it is affected by a legendary enchantment. The rarity of an already-magical item is unaffected by a minor enchantment, but improves by one level (i.e. from common to uncommon) when affected by a major enchantment, or by two levels (uncommon to very rare) if the subject of a legendary enchantment. An item’s rarity cannot exceed legendary in this way. enchantMents legendary Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Medium Random minor enchantment 100 gp 3 enchants / day — Rolled on the Minor Enchantments table Random major enchantment 500 gp 3 enchants / day — Rolled on the Major Enchantments table Good Chosen minor enchantment 200 gp 3 enchants / day — Chosen from the Minor Enchantments table Chosen major enchantment 1,000 gp 3 enchants / day — Chosen from the Major Enchantments table Random legendary enchantment 5,000 gp 3 enchants / day — Rolled on the Legendary Enchantments table Excellent Chosen legendary enchantment 10,000 gp 3 enchants / day — Chosen from the Legendary Enchantments table 57 Minor enchantMents d10 Name Effect 1 Beacon Bonus action: Item begins (or ceases) shedding bright light in a 15-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 15 feet beyond that 2 Calling Bonus action: The item emits a non-verbal sound of your choice, heard out to 300 ft. 3 Compass Bonus action: The item indicates (in some fashion) which way is north.

In this place, sacred to the fey, the faun waits for the occasional adventurous wanderer, hunter, or forager delving too deep into the woods. The faun has wares he would trade, and many simple favors he would ask. Wearing a cloak of leaves that sweeps the ground as she walks, a female eladrin has a motley collection of wares spread wide across her wooden tabletop at a local market. She smiles at all who approach, and is quick to inform those who visit of her no-currency policy. It is only when her customers are deep into negotiations that her eyes sparkle with a hidden malice, and those barter- ing may begin to suspect she is more than she seems. The fey are widely known for their interest in bargain- ing with mortals, but are not necessarily inclined to reveal themselves as denizens of the Feywild unless such suits their purpose. Geas. Holding little interest in coin, the fey prefer to trade in favors, sealed by a variation of the geas spell, to compel their customers to act in certain ways. As such, fey bargains have no currency cost, but have an associ- ated price in a minor, major, or legendary geas, rolled randomly on the following Geas tables. If a geas would not apply for whatever reason, reroll until you receive a geas that does. A geas must be known by the customer before it is agreed upon and, though the fey do not lie, they may attempt to egregiously mislead those with whom they deal. Fey merchants will only sell one item to each of their customers, considering overburdening their customers with geases to be impractical. fey bargains legendary Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Medium Bag of tricks, rust Minor geas Only 1, ever DMG 154 — Boots of elvenkind Minor geas Only 1, set ever DMG 155 — Boots of false tracks Minor geas Only 1 set, ever XGE 136 Makes your tracks appear as another humanoid’s Bracers of archery Minor geas Only 1, ever DMG 156 — Charlatan’s die Minor geas Only 1, ever XGE 136 You control what number it rolls Cloak of elvenkind Minor geas Only 1, ever DMG 158 — Cloak of many fashions Minor geas Only 1, ever XGE 136 Can be made to appear how you wish Dark shard amulet Minor geas Only 1, ever XGE 137 Warlock only; attempt to cast extra cantrips Feywild shard Minor geas Only 1, ever TCE 127 Sorcerer only; metamagic makes wild magic occur Glamerweave, uncommon Minor geas Only 1, ever ERLW 277 — Gloves of thievery Minor geas Only 1, ever DMG 172 — Moon-touched sword, any Minor geas Only 1, ever XGE 138 Sheds bright light for 15 feet, dim light 15 feet beyond that Mystery key Minor geas Only 1, ever XGE 138 Has a 5% chance to unlock any door, then disappear Perfume of bewitching Minor geas Only 1, ever XGE 138 Adv. on Cha. checks vs. humanoids ≤ CR 1 for 1 hr.

Unlike the spell in the Player’s Handbook, the geas this merchant uses is much more powerful, a magic as old as song and story, and cannot be broken easily. At your DM’s discretion, a wish spell may be able to break a geas from this merchant, but no lesser magic will work. Divine intervention, or a quest from this merchant or a fey rival of the merchant may be able to undo such a geas, but such things are never simple, and even undone a geas’ effects may still linger. Regardless of whether or not the geas is still in effect, a char- acter that bargains with this merchant will likely be a subject of the merchant’s interest for many years to come. 60 Magic Items Stroking the end of his long, white, curled beard, a gnome wearing a pointy hat sits at the open back end of his covered cart. Painted above him is a rough wooden sign advertising his wheeled shop. Behind him pulses the telltale thrum of magic, cascading gently off of the items behind him in the wagon. Placing a gentle hand upon a silver ring, a high elf concentrates her magical energies on the runed circle in which the ring resides. Sprinkling residuum around the edges, the circle suddenly ignites in a bright flash of arcane power, leaving her shop smelling faintly of ozone. Removing her hand, she smiles as she observes the ring, now shimmering and twinkling with a subtle eldritch resonance. A rarity in many worlds, merchants with this specialty are often highly sought after. Magic items are always hard to make, and few know the arcane secrets behind their creation. Those who craft magic items often find their arrival in a town to be a momentous occasion, that can change the shape of the town and its people for lifetimes to come.

Before him dances a lithe, golden flying serpent, which twists and coils in response to the man’s music. Sitting at the open end of her wagon, a female copper- scaled dragonborn watches the crowds pass her by. She waits patiently, attempting not to attract too much or too little notice, as her cargo of vibrantly-glimmering dragon eggs shimmers gently in the covered wagon’s soft light. Magical beasts are, by their nature, hard to control or tame, and only a select few individuals have the ability to coax such creatures into following and listening to them. Of these, fewer still have the predilection to sell such creatures, but merchants of magical creatures are highly sought-after wherever they may find themselves. Sold creatures are usually tame, but may not be, if marked otherwise. Untamed magical creatures use the rules presented with the Animals merchant on page 12, and in the “Taming the Untamed” sidebar on page 13 of this supplement.

Every night finds him here, waiting for either the call of the spirits, or for interested customers to seek his wares. After slumbering in near-death for centuries, a lich awoke to find a city had been built on top of her ancient dungeon. Rather than vow revenge against the living, however, the lich was of a more practical mind, building her dungeon into a shop for all comers, to finance the dread experiments that are no doubt taking place below. The relationship between necromancers and wider society is often troubled, at best, but that doesn’t stop an enterprising few from building a niche market among the grave-minded. Both the dead and the living have needs, after all, and the exchange of coin facili- tates everyone’s needs being met. Depending on loca- tion and the area’s dominant moral set, the exchange of necromantic goods and services may be illegal, merely frowned upon, or a normal and accepted part of everyday life. necroMancy legendary Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Medium Acid 25 gp / vial 1d4 × 5 vials PHB 150 — Alchemist’s supplies 50 gp 1d4 PHB 154 — Amulet 5 gp 1d4 PHB 150 Holy symbol; has a profane symbol of a god of death Bones, full set 5 gp / set 1d4 × 4 sets — Good for necromancy, and maybe even soup Dust of dryness 250 gp 1d4 DMG 166 — Candle 1 cp 1d4 × 10 PHB 150 Comes in black, grey, white, or red Chain 5 gp / 10 ft. 1d4 × 20 ft.

Though new to town, he has already acquired a reputation for outlandish deals, coupled with strange requests, and only the most perceptive among the locals have noticed a hint of brimstone to the incense that burns within his shop. Seated on a stool at a crossroads, an impeccably dressed gentleman holds a wooden case in his lap. Surprisingly, its contents always seem to be exactly what his customers desire, and he’s more than willing to part with it for a fair price, and the smallest of favors. The fiends of the Nine Hells are no strangers to business, and occasionally take part in the financial dealings of the mortal world to spread discord and their own influence. Money, however, is not an object to these disguised merchants from down below, and they will gladly offer a discount if the purchaser agrees to perform a favor or two that will further their many agendas. needful things legendary Merchant Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Medium Bag of holding 500 gp Only 1d4, ever DMG 153 Holds 64 cu. ft., or 500 lbs; always weighs 15 lbs.

A Needful Things legendary merchant always inherently knows the alignment of those they deal with, and this merchant operates differently depending on the moral inclinations of their current customer. Selling Your Soul. The highest prize a Needful Things merchant can hope for is a character’s soul, particularly a soul belonging to an otherwise good (or even neutral) character. This merchant is willing to trade any item for a character’s soul at no additional cost, assuming the character does not have any other external claims on their soul. Doing so places the character under the effects of a permanent dominate person spell cast by the merchant without concentration, which the merchant typically utilizes sparingly but to great effect. This can only be broken by a wish spell or divine intervention, but doing so causes the free item to disappear, returning to the merchant. Inconsequential Favors. A soul is a high price to pay, and this merchant recognizes that some souls may not be acquired without adequate temptation beforehand. Good and neutral characters will find this merchant is willing to offer discounts in return for incon- sequential favors, rolled at random on the associated table. Each favor successfully performed (the merchant inherently knows if a favor was completed) decreases the price of a chosen item by half. Favors are cumulative: a single favor reduces an item to 1/2 price, two favors reduce it to 1/4 price, and three favors reduce the item to 1/8 price. The merchant will accept no more than three favors at a time, and will only discount a single item this way each time they are encountered. Needless to say, these favors all have dire consequences, which may not be readily apparent to the character performing them. Upon purchasing their discounted item, the character has a sense that they released an evil into the world, but is at a loss to describe the nature of what has transpired. 67 d20 Inconsequential Favors 1 Dump a suspicious vial in a nearby well. 2 Smear a pentagram of blood at a specific holy site. 3 Loosen the wheels on a nearby wagon. 4 Convince a child a prize awaits them in the wilderness. 5 Remove the head and hands of a specific statue. 6 Toss a bag of mice into the local mill. 7 Coat the inn’s woodpile in lamp oil. 8 Leave a slaughtered black goat in the town square. 9 Public accuse a priest of practicing dark magic. 10 Spread rumors of a married couple’s infidelity. d20 Inconsequential Favors 11 Eat whole a buzzing, wriggling, live horsefly. 12 Say a specific fiend’s name into a mirror, thrice. 13 Kill a noble’s pet, leave it where it will be found. 14 Publicly set alight a specific holy book. 15 Steal a local relic, leave it in a feed trough. 16 Instigate a bloody fight between complete strangers. 17 Set a specific bridge on fire. 18 Dig up a specific corpse, hide its parts around town. 19 Steal food from a specific poor family, throw it away. 20 Roll twice, disregarding 20.

Briefly he holds it aloft, waves it slowly around, and then shakes it violently before sighing and placing it in a pouch at his side. As he opens the pouch, a careful onlooker could spot a wealth of similar strange creations and contraptions, before the human quickly and carefully ties his pouch shut. Set up adjacent to an inn, a man with tossled hair and a surprisingly vivid bow-tie has a collection of odd wares spread across a ramshackle wooden table that appears inexpertly cobbled together. Behind the man lies, on its side, an oblong and smoldering blue box, into which he reaches periodically to retrieve new goods, appraising each in turn before shrugging and placing them upon his slapshod table. As some arcanists and scholars of the immaterial know, planar travel is not the only method for explor- ing the multiverse. Through either a quirk of reality or their own design, few denizens of a future time may stumble into the past. These individuals almost always have returning to their native time as their driving goal, and may be willing to trade away some of their foreign resources to gain the currency they need to achieve this end.

It’s thus highly recommended that you use the Figuring Out Alien Technology table and associated rules on page 268 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide to illustrate this disconnect for any item labeled as “tech.” The number rating associated with tech repre- sents the successes needed to figure out an item, and more difficult technology requires more successes. Understanding how an item works is the first step to gaining proficiency with it. To acquire proficiency, you must train with the item for 250 days, spending 1 gp on training costs per day. Refer to the Training downtime activity on page 187 of the Player’s Handbook for any further specifics. 69 Quality Items Price Quantity Source Notes Tangler grenade 250 gp 1d4 WDMM 244 Throw up to 60 ft.: grenade explodes, creatures within 10 ft. make a DC 15 Dex save.
