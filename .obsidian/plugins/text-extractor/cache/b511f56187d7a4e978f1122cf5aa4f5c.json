Race to the Depths 3 A newly erupted volcano exposes an ancient temple to a world that has forgotten it. Race to the Depths will pit players against other groups of adventurers and treasure seekers to recover plunder from this crumbling edifice. Getting Started Race to the Depths is an adventure that starts in a port city called Alaghon on the northeastern coast of Turmish, but you can incorporate it into any sea or even lakeside city or village. The gods (and their temples) featured in this adventure are native to the land of Faerun in the Forgotten Realms setting, but you can simply substitute the gods found here with similar ones from your chosen setting. The gods mentioned in this adventure are as follows: Umberlee: Goddess of the sea, generally feared by sailors. Valkur: God of sailors and safe passage over the sea. Selune: Goddess of the Moon Chauntea: Goddess of farmers and the harvest. The combat is designed for a party of 4th level adventurers. See “Adjusting Difficulty” for suggestions on tailoring this adventure for parties of different sizes. This document assumes you have access to at least the 5th Edition D&D Player’s Handbook, the Dungeon Master's Guide, and the Monster Manual. You may want to familiarize yourself with the following enemies found in the Monster Manual before beginning: -Sahuagin -Sahuagin Priestess -Water Weird -Reef Shark -Bandit -Bandit Captain -Noble -Mastiff -Thug -Commoner -Priest -Giant Octopus -Veteran -Acolyte All magical items mentioned in this adventure can be found in the magic items section of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

There’s been a buzz around the city in recent days, all talk is of the volcano. A few days ago, a nearby small island volcano erupted briefly yet violently. The smoke and ash can even be seen from shore, tinting the sunset magnificent colors. The eruption tore apart the island and revealed a temple to some unknown deity hidden underground. A local wizard by the name of Askal Vendt scryed the temple and believes that there is a powerful artifact there; a dagger that had been involved in some kind of ritual. The wizard has been unable to determine further details. He has hired the party to travel to the temple and retrieve the dagger as well as any other artifacts of worth. He will pay the party 1,000 gold pieces for the dagger and 75 gold pieces for each artifact of value brought to him. The deal is struck and everyone involved relaxes over tea in Askal’s modest study. Askal Vendt Still handsome but somewhat rounder and softer than he used to be, Askal Vendt is a middle aged wizard residing in Alaghon. He is a man content to conduct magical research from his home and pays adventurers to gather rare artifacts. Askal is Jovial and will advise the party if asked. Some important information that he can tell the party includes: -The volcano island is only about two days of hard sailing from Alaghon. -A round trip to the island and back should cost no more than a couple hundred gold pieces. -There are several ships for hire down at the docks. -One of these ships, the Waylander, is owned by a notorious cheapskate named Captain Ghend. -Other adventurers in town will surely head to the temple to claim the treasure. -He recommends haste. Setting Off Not long after leaving Askal’s home, the party will notice a lot of activity in the streets. People from all walks of life are rushing towards the docks. When questioned, commoners will inform the party that word has spread of the treasures in the temple somehow, and expeditions are being sent out to claim them. Adventurers and mercenaries are fighting over the limited ships available to sail to the island. It is quite a spectacle. Around the corner to the docks street, a motley crew of thugs in the final stages of a mugging block the way. The leader releases his terrified prey and turns around with a cocked head, as though listening for full coin pouches. On their way to the docks, the players will encounter a street gang who also have their sights set on the temple. They stand in the party’s way and attempt to rob them. The gang consists of 1 thug and 5 bandits. These bullies are used to roughing up peasants, however, and not seasoned adventurers. The Thug leaves behind 7 GP and a Potion of Healing. Bartering With the Skinflint Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. Race to the Depths 5 The docks are noticeably underpopulated. It seems all of the ships that were capable of any speed have departed; all save one modest sloop. Across the bow of the remaining ship in plain paint and script, the name Waylander is written. Captain Ghend and His Crew Ghend is a Gold Dwarf who has captained the Waylander for a few years now. He covets wealth and is not above skullduggery to scrape a few coppers more out of any endeavor. In fact, he plans to betray the party should they be successful and steal whatever they find in the temple. His crew, however, are not so despicable as he. They suffer from his avarice as well, making a poor wage for long hours. Their dissatisfaction is shared by the first mate, an older and wiry human sailor with dark hair named Prescott. Prescott is an honorable sailor who tries to live by a code where he can. He probably wouldn’t consent to a mutiny, but if Captain Ghend ever did something truly reprehensible he might find himself justified… Captain Ghend knows that he is in the position of power, and will try to extort the players. Since he is the only ship left, he demands 1,000 GP for the round trip. The party will likely be unwilling or unable to pay this exorbitant price. With a little persuading he can be convinced that they are the only paying customers left in town and will drop his price to 500 GP, with a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check. With a lot of persuading he might lower his price to 250 GP, caving to superior bargaining skills and an eagerness to get under way, with a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Payment can be made upon successful return from the island. Throughout the negotiation, Prescott shows visible disgust at his captain’s copper pinching. Ghend agrees to get under way immediately and the Waylander sails into the night. The morning is uneventful, but with a successful DC 10 Charisma check to gather information or a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to eavesdrop the party can learn that the crew is highly dissatisfied with the captain’s leadership. They are overworked and underpaid. The captain is also impatient and on edge, as though he is waiting for something that won’t come soon enough. The Race Is On Towards the end of the first day, the lookout in the crow’s nest spots ships on the horizon. Upon getting closer, two ships can be seen locked in combat and one has boarded the other. Smoke and screams emanate from the chaos. Ghend surveys the scene and says, to no one in particular, “They’re weak, could take ‘em both and their booty. It’d take time though…” The party may choose to ignore them and continue on in the interest of time. But, if the party decides to investigate, they will find that one side has already won by the time they reach the ships. The winning group is a crew consisting of 1 bandit captain, 1 priest, and 3 thugs. Combat has taken its toll however and all of the enemies are at half HP. The party may attack and defeat the crew or make a DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation) check to force their surrender. In either case they will find: 88 GP among the crew, food and water for 10 days total, a healer’s kit, a climbers kit, and 100 extra feet of rope. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. Race to the Depths 6 The Island The next day, the island comes into clear view. The ruins of the temple can be made out in the center of it, sitting in the shadow of a slowly dispersing ash cloud. The volcano puffs lightly, docile and quiet. A direct sea route is impossible due to debris from the eruption, but the crescent shaped island shows two possible landing beaches with paths to the temple. The first path on the east end of the island looks somewhat treacherous due to jagged rocks but is shorter and likely faster. The second path on the west end of the island runs through a forest and is longer but looks the easiest. A ship lays moored just off the west beach. If the party was delayed somehow from reaching here (such as from shopping back in Alaghon, or attacking the other ships along the way), then the rival adventuring party has already left their ship and may reach the temple first. If the party hurried here, the other ship has just landed and they have a chance to beat their rivals there if they take the shorter, harder path. If the party decides to take the easier path and follow their rivals at the west beach, the forest is uneventful until they reach the temple, skip ahead to “Encountering the Rivals”, then continue the adventure from “Umberlee’s Sanctuary”. If they choose the harder path, Captain Ghend drops them at the east beach. The party must move slowly among the jagged rocks, but may attempt DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks if they wish to hurry. Hurrying will negate a previous delay. Failure results in a fall dealing 1d4 piercing damage as well as a delay. The Wounded Land The dangerous and rocky terrain eventually softens to a dense forest. The going is easy, but soon after entering the forest the path is interrupted by a great fissure. This deep wound in the land was likely formed by the recent eruption. It is roughly 60 feet across and 150 feet deep. Trees lean precariously over the edge after being uprooted by the upheaval and some have fallen in entirely. The bottom is, of course, also littered with jagged stones and protrusions. A DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check will show that there are a couple trees nearby that, when felled, could create a suitable bridge. There are also trees on the other side, making it possible to fire a rope arrow or grappling hook into one to make a bridge. This may prove dangerous to heavier characters however, at the DM’s discretion. Climbing down the crevasse and back up is also possible, but time consuming (resulting in another delay). The jagged rocks are easy enough to descend, but require a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to climb up. Failure results in a fall which forces the player to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check to catch themselves or suffer 18 (6d6) falling damage, half bludgeoning half piercing. Once the fissure has been crossed, the party will then find itself at the entrance to the temple. If the party has been delayed one or more times and has not taken an opportunity to hurry, they meet the rival adventuring party at the entrance. Skip ahead to “Encountering the Rivals” and return here once the encounter is resolved. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. Race to the Depths 7 Umberlee’s Sanctuary In the middle of this sparse forest, the ground is sundered and the upheaval reveals an entrance to the temple. What once was a subterranean grand hall now lies exposed to the sun for the first time. It must have been the size of village square when it was whole, perhaps larger. One end of the hall falls away into the sea and the other leads deeper into the ground. Large statues of aquatic beasts and monsters jut from the walls and the enormous columns that once supported the now absent ceiling are carved with scenes of sea storms. Anyone could easily identify this as a place of worship for Umberlee; The Bitch Queen, goddess of the sea, and terror of sailors. Two small doors lead the way further into the island. Upon entering the temple, the party will walk down a narrow corridor. A character with a 13 or higher Passive Perception will be alerted to a presence up ahead. There is a small group of people in the next room, arguing. With a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check, party members may sneak to the doorway and observe them. In this large room are two armed men, a servant, and a well-dressed man with a large dog on a leash standing in a circle. Two more members of their party lie dead on the floor. Nearby there are a few corpses of strange looking, fish-like humanoids. They are arguing nervously about what to do next. The group consists of 1 noble, 1 veteran, 1 commoner, and 1 mastiff. If the party decides to listen for a while, they will discover that these explorers are considering turning around and going home with the meager amount of artifacts they have uncovered. If attacked they will defend themselves. If spoken to, the well-dressed man reveals himself to be a Lord Plumtree, a noble from Sembia who wished to plunder the temple for fame and glory. With the death of his guards at the hands of the sahuagin, however, he wishes to return to Alaghon and stay no longer in this dangerous place. It is clear that his group already possess a few artifacts of value from the temple, and will give them up if defeated or with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check. If allowed to leave, they will do so and trouble the party no more. If robbed, they carry 29 GP and 4 artifacts of value from the temple of Umberlee. After dealing with the noble, the party can see what was blocking his way. The Gate of Fealty A massive set of double doors made of stone about 15 feet high makes up most of the wall. There is no apparent way to open them. In front of the door there are three small pedestals. On one sits a small stone carving of a ship. Another pedestal holds a carving of the moon and the third bears a tablet depicting rich farmland. Etched on the face of the door is a fantastic scene of the goddess Umberlee smashing a sailing ship. Below her, a farmer flees for his life as a tidal wave engulfs his land and home. Above her, dark clouds move in to block out the moon. With a successful Intelligence (Religion) check the following can be discovered: -DC 10, The ship bears holy markings of Valkur, the Moon shows markings of Selune, and the grove shows markings of Chauntea; Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. Race to the Depths 8 these three gods are Umberlee’s most hated enemies. -DC 15, Umberlee is petty and spiteful; the undoing of her enemies is her greatest wish. -DC 20, Umberlee’s church sometimes holds rites in which they destroy her enemies in effigy, ceremoniously defeating depictions of her enemies. For the door to open, each pedestal item must have an action performed on it. The ship must be broken into at least two pieces, the moon must be completely obscured from sight, and the grove must have water poured onto it. Upon performing the correct action for a particular carving, the relevant section of the door will light up with a pale blue glow. The door opens automatically when all three actions are performed, and the ship carving of Valkur immediately reforms itself as though a mending spell were cast upon it. The carvings also count as 3 artifacts of value. There is a simple lever to open and close the door from the inside. Rising Tide Immediately after passing through the door, there is a short hallway and spiral staircase leading down. The first person to step foot on the staircase must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or slip on the slick algae-covered stairs and take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage. A Passive Perception score of 14 will spot the algae beforehand. At the bottom of the staircase, you find yourself in a large chamber. This room however, looks to be naturally formed. Stalactites dot the ceiling of and deep pools of seawater can be found on the floor. The damp, unhewn walls are covered in bioluminescent algae that glows soft greens and blues. You can see from the stairwell that small tools, iconography, and bones lie near the pools of water on the ground. At the opposite end of the cavern, a heavy door made of jagged coral stands with a lever nearby. Strewn about the room are 5 artifacts of value. A DC 11 intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the bones are humanoid, and that they have been gnawed upon by an animal resembling a shark. A DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a section of the wall that has fallen away to reveal a broken pipe. Near the door, portions of the wall have fallen away to reveal a strange mechanism resembling a water tank. The tank is damaged and pipes on top of it has been destroyed, allowing vision inside of the tank. A DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the door will open when the tank is filled with water (requiring at least 5 gallons of water). Upon pulling the switch next to the door, water will begin to erupt from the broken pipes in the wall. The pipes lead to the door, but must be fixed with a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to jury rig a solution before the water will flow into the tank and unlock it. Pulling the lever, draws the attention of the Sahuagin. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. Race to the Depths 9 Above the roar of the water coursing through the wall angry, inhuman cries echo throughout the chamber. Several fish-like humanoids breach violently from the water pools. “Do not dare defile the Sea Queen’s temple! We are her chosen! Her treasures are ours to protect!” 1 sahuagin priestess and 4 sahuagin climb out of the pools of water near the stairwell and attack the party. The Sahuagin can move freely between water pools with no penalty and have total concealment while doing so. 3 rounds after the lever is pulled, the water flow from the wall stops, but 2 feet of seawater now covers the ground. It is considered difficult terrain but creatures with a swim speed may swim instead of walking. 2 reef sharks also enter combat on the third round, under control of the Sahuagin. The Sahuagin, once defeated, leave behind shiny bits of coral valued at 84 GP as well as a Trident of Fish Command. Searching the pools reveals 2 small pearls valued at 100 GP each. After the Sahuagin have been dealt with and the tank is somehow filled with water, the door opens. Hallowed Chambers Through the door is a corridor inlaid with decorative coral and the bones of sea creatures. It eventually opens into a dome shaped room with a dais at its center. Upon the dais is a pulpit resembling a crashing wave. The floor is littered with rotted tapestries and once beautiful carpets. There are two doors, one behind and another to the right of the dais. The pulpit has 1 artifact of value in it. The door behind the dais is rotted wood and can easily be destroyed. It leads to what looks like private chambers. This small room may have once been opulent. A stone slab that was probably a bed at one time juts out of the wall. A collapsed bookshelf covered in algae slumps up against the opposite wall. All around you are the remains of finery that time has turned to damp filth. The curtains, clothing, jewelry, and art in this room would have fetched quite the price had the years not stripped away their value. A DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a key to the other door near the dais, 3 artifacts of value, and a skeleton wearing a suit of Mariner’s Armor (Breastplate) under the rubble. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check allows the party to find a hidden and locked compartment in the bed that can be opened with a DC 12 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check. It is trapped with a magical cone of thunder that emits from the ceiling. This trap is identical to the fire breathing trap found on page 122 of the Dungeon Master’s guide except that opening the container triggers the trap and it deals thunder damage instead of fire. The compartment holds 2 more artifacts of value, a bottle of wine still drinkable valued at 25 GP, and 3 Potions of Water Breathing. The door to the right of the dais is locked. It can be picked with a DC 14 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check, or the key can be found in the head priest’s chambers. The door is made of reinforced wood but is not magical and therefore can be destroyed with the proper application of force. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. Race to the Depths 10 In this room there is very little, save something that resembles a well. The rim of the well is highly stylized likening it to a swirling whirlpool. The water fills the well to the rim. It is still, dark, and smells of the sea. The well in this room is actually a secret underwater passage to a hidden ritual chamber. The well itself is about 30 feet deep and a small tunnel branches off from the well and leads deeper. The passage is 80 feet long and is completely dark. There are dead ends, twists, and turns in the tunnel and a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to prevent becoming lost. A player who becomes lost spends 3 rounds backtracking and reorienting themselves and must make another Wisdom check to proceed in either direction. Once successfully navigating the passage, a player can easily recall the correct path. Remnants of a Forgotten Raid The underwater passage opens into a small, natural cave. A skeleton is propped up on the opposite wall from the exit pool. This person has been dead decades if not centuries, and much of their possessions have decayed into nothing. A small pouch on what used to be a belt looks salvageable. Beyond the old skeleton a low, cramped tunnel covered in sea life leads further in. Pale crabs skitter about and colorful anemones retreat inward when approached. The pouch nearby contains 7 (1d6+4) pinches of Dust of Dryness. His belt buckle also bears the symbol of Selune. The tunnel has poisonous sea scorpions on the walls in some areas. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to spot them. A DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check will allow characters to determine that the scorpions are poisonous and territorial, attacking any who get close. If the scorpions go unnoticed, they make a melee attack against the first person to approach (+8 to hit). A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must make a Constitution check of 13 or take an additional 11 (2d10) poison damage. Once spotted, they are easily dispatched. The tunnel drops off a short ledge into a cavern covered in knee high water. This cavern is about 30 feet wide and 90 feet long and there are a couple trickles of water pouring from the ceiling. At the far end, an altar with some artifacts strewn about it stands above the rest of the sunken floor. All around the room, skeletal remains poke out of the water and appear to bob as small waves pass over them. At the center of the altar a skeleton lies face down grasping a dagger in its hand. It lies frozen in an outstretched position from when its owner made a final desperate effort. The dagger is lodged in a cracked stone tablet covered in runes and glows slightly with infused magic. 2 Water Weirds attack the party in this room as they reach halfway to the altar. The water is again at a level that restricts movement so it is considered difficult terrain but creatures with swim speeds may swim instead. The altar at the rear of the room is above the water so it is normal terrain. If a Water Weird is brought to less than half its hit points it will retreat to one of the 2 trickles of water pouring from the ceiling. Once there it can spend an action to stand underneath and regain 1d10 + 1 hit points. The dust of dryness is particularly useful against these water elementals, refer to its entry in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. Race to the Depths 11 Upon defeating the Water Weirds and searching the room they find the magic dagger they are seeking. It is found upon the altar, protruding from the rune covered tablet into which it was thrust. It is faintly magical, yet unidentifiable and confers no benefit if wielded. Additionally, among the dead they find a pair of Sending Stones, 3 Potions of Water Breathing, 3 Potions of Climbing, and a Folding Boat. 6 artifacts of value can be found on the altar and in the water. An Intelligence (Religion) check DC 10 reveals that the dead were worshippers of Umberlee and Selune that slew each other. Intelligence (Arcana) checks of DC 15 will tell the players that a powerful ritual designed to affect the weather or perhaps the moon was stopped here before it could complete. Encountering the Rivals After backtracking to the entrance of the temple (or before reaching the temple if the party was delayed) they meet a rival group attempting to plumb the depths of the newly exposed temple. A Passive Perception score of 14 will alert the party to their presence before they come into view. They are picking through the ruins of the grand hall (before the first locked door). If the rivals reached the temple first, it is impossible to sneak past as they are watching the approaches. However, their backs are turned to the entrance so if the party reached the temple first and meet the rivals as they leave, they may sneak past or even flee. In this case use chase rules in the Dungeon Master’s Guide and run the fissure encounter again if applicable. If confronted, the rivals are shown to be worshippers of Umberlee, come to return the treasures interred here to the church. They will stop at nothing short of complete surrender of all artifacts and gold in the party’s possession and their immediate return to whence they came. If refused or incited, they will attack. The rival group consists of 1 Priest and 3 Acolytes. If one of his acolytes is slain, or if he is reduced to less than half of his hit points, the priest uses a Scroll of Conjure Animals on his next turn to summon a Giant Octopus to attack the party. The octopus is susceptible to the Trident of Fish Command. If the priest is slain before he can use the scroll, it can be looted from his corpse along with polished coral valued at 58 GP. The Temple Conquered Ghend’s Betrayal Captain Ghend’s men are waiting in a landing craft at the beach where the players left them. After boarding the Waylander, Captain Ghend reveals his betrayal. He demands that the players turn over all of the artifacts and promises to leave the players in a launch boat with supplies enough to make it back to Alaghon. Prescott is shocked and appalled by this demand and tries to protest. He is silenced by the captain and waits to see what happens. The sailors seem unsure of what to do. If the players appeal to Prescott or the sailors to mutiny or disobey, they may engage in a skill contest with Captain Ghend using either Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation). Use the Bandit Captain statistics for Captain Ghend. If the party rolls a higher check that the Captain, the crew refuses him and mutinies, locking Ghend away below decks and honoring the Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. Race to the Depths 12 original agreement. If the party fails, Ghend, Prescott (a Thug), and 4 Bandits attack the party. When Ghend is killed or incapacitated, the remaining crew surrenders and honors the original agreement. The Second Sunset The Waylander cuts smoothly through the red, sunset tinged waters of the Alaghon harbor. Throngs of gawkers and curious onlookers clog the docks to catch glimpses of the treasure seekers’ return. A priest of Umberlee stands stoically at the end of the docks. His face wears a dark and menacing expression and he puffs up his chest before speaking. The Priest of Umberlee is furious and threatens the party with the wrath of the Bitch Queen if they do not return the artifacts to their rightful owners. The priest offers a meager 400 GP for the dagger and a 35 GP “finder’s fee” for each artifact of value. However, he also offers to grant each party member two magical blessings of Umberlee; a Charm of Darkvision and a Charm of Vitality. Rules for charms can be found on page 228 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. If refused, the priest will curse loudly but take no further action. Askal Vendt will happily pay the agreed upon price and is curious to hear the party’s tale. He will even treat the party to a night of modest carousing if they promise to regale him with their account of the temple. Askal is unsure what the dagger may be or what it can do. Perhaps it no longer can be of use, or perhaps… Ending the Adventure The simplest way to handle character growth is to award a level to each player for completing this adventure. If you wish to award experience points, refer to the statistics of the enemies that were defeated in the Monster Manual. Encounters that were avoided with stealth or charisma should award experience points for those enemies that were avoided or evaded. Reaching the temple is a “medium encounter” so award each player their medium XP threshold as shown on the “XP Thresholds by Character Level” table in the Dungeon Master’s Guide page 82. Navigating the temple to its end and back is a “deadly encounter”. Finding any hidden treasure is an “easy encounter”. Adjusting Difficulty To make the adventure more difficult or tailor it to combat heavy parties, consider altering some of the enemies in each encounter in the following ways: upgrade bandits to thugs, upgrade the sahuagin priestess to a sahuagin baron, add a hunter shark to the water weird encounter, raise the water level on applicable battlefields and force the combat to take place underwater, start enemies who were injured before combat with full hit points. To make the adventure easier: start rival adventuring groups at reduced hit points to reflect the hard journey to the temple, downgrade thugs to bandits, remove the water hazards from battlefields, replace one of the water weirds with 2 sahuagin.
