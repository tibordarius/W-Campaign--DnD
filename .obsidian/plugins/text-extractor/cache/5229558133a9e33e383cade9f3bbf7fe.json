Whispering Waves - A Oneshot This is a 2-4 hour adventure for a group of 1-6 playersof level 4-6. Summary This is a story about trust and horrors from the sea. It takes place on a small ship at sea called the Proud Companion. The party is on a multi-day journey across the ocean without any land in sight when a strange affliction threatens the safety and trust of the crew and party. Hooks Below are some hooks you may consider using for your session. Feel free to use all of them or none of them depending on what you need for your group and situation. Some of these hooks can dramatically change the occupations of the crew members needed aboard the ship. The party needs transportation to another continent and commissions a merchant vessel to take them there. The party is a new group of prisoners aboard a prison ship. This ship is a military scout and the players are soldiers aboard the ship. The party is returning from raiding a dungeon and hires a cargo vessel to carry the looted goods back to home. A sea monster hunt has gone awry and the ship has lost sight of the quarry. Important Characters It is recommended to come up with some unique characters for your ship based on the circumstances and type of ship that the party is traveling on. Below are some common occupations on a ship that you may want to consider filling: Navigator Sometimes called a sailing master, they are in charge of navigation and maps. Boatswain Supervisor of the deck crew, essentially a foreman for the ship. Quartermaster Typically in charge of keeping track of supplies and logistics aboard. Cook In charge of preparing food and handling livestock. Surgeon The medic and oftentimes the carpenter. Helmsman Also known as a skipper, they are in charge of piloting the vessel. 1 Captain - Ralom Hingsley Desires To protect his dear crew and to keep them out of danger. Fears He thinks silence is oppressive and likes to listen to the waves. A strong dwarf male and the captain of the Proud Companion. A friendly captain that believes in the good in people. Seaman - Jonas Miller Desires A true friend who deeply connects with him. Fears Being left out. A young human male and part of the crew of the Proud Companion. He is the catalyst of the infection. Unbeknownst to him, he contracted it while peering into the water on a moonless night. Proud Companion The Proud Companion resembles an 18th century brigantine with two decks and an aftcastle. Below are some interesting areas that appear on the Proud Companion regardless of the duty of the ship. Captain’s Cabin The captain's quarters are small, but include a full bed, wardrobe, desk, chair, and two locked chests. The captain's quarters can be locked from both inside and outside. The door can be unlocked by succeeding on a DC 13 sleight of hand check. Either chest can be unlocked by succeeding on a DC 18 sleight of hand check. Crew Quarters The ship quarters consist of a small open area where the hammocks are strung up along the walls. These are bunked up to three high to conserve room on the ship. Chairs and some barrels may be placed around when crew members need tables and seating. Otherwise these may be stored in the hold during rough seas. Galley A metal stove is set up in the rear of the ship. Pots and pans are hanging from racks, and barrels are tied down nearby for quick access. There is a cutlery box which has been nailed to the table it sits on. If the trip is expected to be more than a month they may have some livestock aboard which would be in a separate location on the ship. Cabins A more luxurious ship may have cabins which are lockable from both sides. It may have enough room for a small cot or hammock and room for luggage. Hold A room which is used to stock supplies in barrels and crates. It can be locked from the outside only, and the quartermaster would typically hold the key. 2 Infection Mechanics Discreetly track the stage of infection for each player and important NPC. Upon contracting the disease for the first time, they will enter the Contact Stage. The infection will progress to the next stage after a long rest. After a long rest if the infection progresses to the next stage, they will take one point of exhaustion. This infection is bio-magical and not considered a curse. It is derived from the innate magical properties of the Whisperborn. Dispel magic will automatically succeed, but will only reduce the infection level down by one stage. There should be at least one infected creature aboard the ship at all times or the adventure will never start. The infection is spread through physical contact with another person such as a handshake or hug. Upon contact with a non-infected individual, they are immediately infected and begin at the Contact Stage. Contact Stage After contracting the infection, each time the player interacts with a non-infected individual, they will be filled with the desire for physical contact. Bodily warmth will satisfy this desire for 1 hour. Consider reading the following out loud, or secretly giving this to the infected player the first time they interact with a non-infected. The air chills around you and your skin feels tingly. It's a normal kind of cold and the person in front of you looks so warm, maybe they wouldn't mind helping you warm up a little. To resist the urge, they must succeed a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be charmed and forced to do their best to make physical contact with the other person. For brevity NPCs can be made to automatically fail this save. When a creature begins a long rest, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the Whisperborn that will be birthed from this creature will be empowered once and the creature will take a point for exhaustion. Keep track of how many times each Whisperborn is empowered per character. Empowerment for NPC characters can be disregarded. See Rending Stage for more details for NPCs. After the long rest, the creature will evolve to the Whisper Stage. Whisper Stage Any creature in the Whisper Stage will still feel the need for warmth from other characters. If there are no characters that are not infected, they will simply feel a perpetual chill. In addition to the effects of the Contact Stage, creatures that can see the water will start to hear whispers from the ocean. The first time a character hears these whispers, consider reading the following out loud: As you gaze into the water, a quiet darkness fills you. Unintelligible voices begin to drip into your mind. They are whispering something sweet and gentle, something unfathomable, something warm. The whispers are in Abyssal and are unclear. If the creature understands Abyssal and succeeds 3 on a DC 12 Intelligence check, the whispers are an intertwining of the following: Dark Home More Friends Warm Blood Quiet Embrace Desire More When a creature begins a long rest, they must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the Whisperborn that will be birthed from this creature will be empowered one level further and the creature will take a point of exhaustion. After the long rest, the afflicted creature will enter the Quiet Stage. Quiet Stage In the Quiet Stage, the whispers become louder and more oppressive. The effects of the previous stages are still active. When a character wakes up in the Quiet Stage, consider reading the following out loud: Even without seeing the waves, the sound of whispering assails your ears. It's louder, more demanding. It feels like it's reaching into your soul. You have to get away. As far away from the sea, as far away from the sounds as you can. The creature feels the need to find a dark corner of the ship away from being able to see the waves. The creature must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw to resist the urge, else take 2d4 psychic damage. This check does not need to be repeated. When a creature begins a long rest, they must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the Whisperborn that will be birthed from this creature will be empowered one level further and the creature will take a point of exhaustion. After the long rest, the creature will enter the Rending Stage. Rending Stage 1d4 hours after waking up, the Rending begins. Read the following out loud when a new Whisperborn is born: You collapse to the ground as unspeakable agony pierces through your entire body. It feels like all of your bones are being ripped out from your spine. Everyone around sees a thin translucent bioluminescent two-legged two-armed creature rise from your body. After the Whisperborn is out of its host, it will be immediately hostile to all creatures with blood around them and will try to feast on these creatures to gain strength. If the Whisperborn is born with one level of empowerment, the host will take 2d6 necrotic damage. This Whisperborn is born as a Whisperborn Larva. If the Whisperborn is born with two levels of empowerment, the host will take 3d6 necrotic damage. This Whisperborn is born as a Whisperborn Polyp. If the Whisperborn is born with three levels of empowerment, the host will take 4d6 necrotic damage. This Whisperborn is born as a Whisperborn Medusa. 4 For NPCs, roll a 1d3 to determine the empowerment level of the spawned Whisperborn. Whisperborn Stat Blocks 5 Endings Wiping Out the Whisperborn If the party successfully defeats all of the Whisperborn and nobody is left infected, they will be safe and can continue on their journey. Whisperborn are not common at sea and are only really mentioned in old myths and legends. It is possible the crew didn’t know about the Whisperborn. Failure In the case that everybody aboard the ship dies, the Whisperborn will feast on the corpses to gain strength. They will then hide belowdecks and lie dormant until another ship approaches. When this new vessel containing warm-blooded lifeforms approaches, the Whisperborn will discreetly make their way onto it and begin to spread their infection with their remaining lifeforce. The initial Whisperborn that began the infection aboard the Proud Companion will expend the remainder of its lifeforce to start anew the widespread infection before withering away, sinking to the bottom of the ocean. 6","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
