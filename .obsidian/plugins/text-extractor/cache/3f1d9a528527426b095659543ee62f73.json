Its elevation is between the high and low tide levels. When the tide goes out, water surges north through the cave into the ocean. When the tide comes in, water surges south towards a small lagoon. The cave is filled with poisonous coral, and crabs. The crabs eat fish that are washed in by the tide and poisoned by the coral. Abundant and easy food as made them large, numerous and aggressive. PCs that need to get through will face powerful tidal surges that will constantly threaten to sweep them from their feet and into the poisonous coral. They must deal with the crabs while successfully navigating these challenges. Place in a Campaign This can be placed in any campaign that is set near the coast. Here are some suggestions.  The PCs are escaping from a prison or fortification. The sewer leads to this cave, which is the only way out.  PCs need to approach a position unseen. This cave leads into an enemy camp, or lets the PCs approach from an unexpected direction  The PCs are washed into the cave after a shipwreck  Somewhere in the cave is the body of a man with a map tattooed on his scalp. The PCs need to get to him before the crabs eat him  Children from the local village are trapped on one of the dry sections after entering the cave on a dare General Features: The Cave, The Tides, the Coral and The Crabs These are the elements that work together to make the dungeon interesting and challenging. The cave funnels the tides in different directions and speeds. The tidal surges knock the PCs over and push them into the fire coral. The fire coral damages and poisons them, and then the crabs attack when the PCs are weakened. PCs’ movement is hampered by the water, whereas the crabs can swim freely. The Cave: Except where noted, the floor of the cave is sand, which is easy to walk on. Most of the cave is in at least 2 ft. of water. Unless otherwise noted, all submerged squares are difficult terrain. The walls are limestone. They are colored brown, white and gray, and are jagged and pitted. This makes them easy to climb. Climbing up the wall requires a Athletics check DC 10. Climbing on the ceiling requires a Athletics check with a DC 20. There are section of the cave marked that are always above water. These sections are always at least 8 ft. above the floor. Chambers 1 and 11 are brightly lit. Sections 2,8, and 9 are dimly lit. All other sections are dark. The Tides: At low tide, there is only a small stream, 6 inches deep, running along the cave floor. At high tide, the water level is up to 6 feet. The level of the water is always changing. It is easy to walk through the cave at low tide, and almost impossible at high tide. For simplicity’s sake, the encounter has been designed to occur about in the middle. The water behaves differently in each chamber because they are all different shapes and depths. Each area description has a Tides sections that details the effects of water in that area. If your PCs are in the dungeon for more than a day, refer to the chart below for information about the height of the water  Tide surges every d4 rounds  PCs with free hands to hang onto the wall don’t need to save.  A failed save results in being knocked prone and swept 10 ft.  Apply the following modifiers if you want to model different tides. Tide Difficulty Duration Low 0 30 min -2 ft -2 5 hours +1 ft +3 5 hours +3 ft +7 30 min Note: Rope is your friend. PCs who are roped together, or to something solid, gain advantage on rolls to resist the tide. Note: Hang on! PCs who have a hand on the wall gain advantage on rolls to resist the tide. Note: Pay attention. If someone thinks of it, they can watch for signs that the tide is coming. On a successful Perception check DC 12, they can predict the next surge, and gain advantage to resist it. The Fire coral: PCs who finish their turn in or move through a square with fire coral are attacked. It makes one attack at a +0. It gets advantage on this roll if the target is moving in an uncontrolled fashion. This most often happens because PCs are swept by the tide, but could be any sort of uncontrolled movement: diving, tripping, being pushed, or dashing. Creatures hit by the fire coral must succeed on a Constitution save DC 13 or take 1d6 damage and be poisoned for one minute. The Constitution save may be repeated every round. A successful save ends the poisoned effect. If the PCs can see the coral, they can move through its square at 10 ft. per round to avoid being attacked. The coral only grows under the water, so they could also climb, or find another creative way around it. The Crabs: There are three kinds of crabs in this encounter: Crabs, Giant Crabs, and a truly monstrous crab designed for this adventure, Shelley. All of them are immune to both the tidal surges and the fire coral poison. They use their swim speed underwater and do not treat submerged squares as difficult terrain. Stats for the smaller crabs can be found in the Monster Manual in Appendix A. Area descriptions 1: South entrance Through a thick tangle of drooping vines and overhanging branches, you can see a low black line just above the water. It is the entrance to a cave. It is just over ten feet wide, and there is just enough room for your head above the surface of the water. A breath of air from the cave mouth brings the smell of tide pools, rotting fish, and of something acrid that stings your eyes. From time to time, the water level rises slightly, and it gushes from the cave, leaving swirls of foam on the surface.  The south entrance leads to the lagoon, which is fed by a freshwater stream. The cave is only about four feet high here, and mostly submerged. PCs can swim into the cave. The inside is lit by light coming in from the lagoon. The water is clear and bright.  Tides: The tidal surges here are relatively gentle, making the swim only mildly challenging. PCs must make Athletics check DC 12 to make headway. 2: South Chamber The sound of the water is different here: hollower, bigger, more echoes and strange reverberations. The cave is opens out here, and is 20 ft. at its widest point, and more than that high. Dim greenish light provides shifting and uncertain illumination. The water is 2 ft. deep. It is clear, and you can see the rippled sand on the floor of the cave. The smell of salt and rot is stronger here. Up along the east side, up 8 ft of steep limestone wall, there is a shelf recessed into the rock. It looks dry. In an alcove on the west side, there are red and purple shapes protruding from the water. There are three exits to the north. The westernmost one slopes sharply up, and looks dry. The other two are narrow and surging dark water. It swirls when it enters the bottleneck, making tiny vortices and standing waves with filthy foaming crests.  Tides: The tide surges every d4 rounds. Athletics check DC 10 to resist. The water pushes straight back from the north entrance toward the south one. It swirls around the fire coral, so PCs can be pushed in the direction as well.  The red and purple shapes are fire coral. It is half out of the water and easy to spot.  There are 10 crabs (Crab, Monster Manual, P320) waiting under the water near the fire coral. These are small crabs who have driven from richer feeding by the larger ones. They will attack any PCs who come within 10 feet. Roll stealth for the crabs to see if the PCs notice them before they attack. Crabs will focus their attack on PCs who are knocked prone by tide or poisoned by fire coral. XP:200  Behind the Fire Coral is a tiny passage leading to area 6. It is passable to creatures of Small size or less. Medium creatures can pass through at 5 ft. per round Finding it requires success on a Perception check DC 13 3. The Tiny Passage This tiny passage is completely black. The only sensation is rough rock on your fingers and cold water pushing around. Tides: The tide surges every d4 rounds. When it does, PCs must make a Athletics check DC 10 or be flushed back down the tunnel toward room 2. This hurts. PCs who are flushed take d6 points of bludgeoning damage from begin scraped along the rough limestone walls. 4.The Dry Chamber A short narrow tunnel leads steeply up to this chamber. It is narrow, but high ceilinged. The floor is of dry, soft sand. It is utterly black here. A fresh cool breeze comes from somewhere above your head. This small chamber is above the high tide level. This is a place that PCs can retreat to if they are caught by high tide. This can also be used as a redoubt. Only one giant crab could fit through the narrow passageway, and so the PCs may decide to lure their opponents here and defend at some point. The breeze comes from a crack in the rocks that, after several twists and turns, emerges at the top of the limestone cliff in which the cave is embedded. Only tiny creatures will fit through this crack. Finding it requires a Investigation check DC 18. 5. The Rushing Corridor Water swirls and foams in this narrow corridor. When the tide surges, the water here moves violently. The white noise of waves rises to a howl, and makes hearing almost impossible, and the constant motion of the foam on the top of the water is disorienting, and makes it difficult to see below the surface. The tunnel looks about 40 ft. long. The floor of the cave is lower here, and the water is at least 3 ft. deep. The ceiling rises to a chapel-like peak, 10 ft. above your head.  Tides: The tides surge every d4 rounds. Athletics check DC 13 to resist. Failing here pushes PCs 15 ft. south They will either stop at the end of the tunnel or be flushed into room 2, DMs choice.  The Fire coral along the east wall is hidden under the water, and difficult to see. PCs must make a Perception check DC 15 to notice it  There are two giant crabs (Giant Crab, MM P.234) hiding under the water in a small recess at the south end of the tunnel. They get advantage on stealth checks because they are underwater. The water also makes them difficult to hit. (Half cover, AC +2). They will wait until a PC is knocked prone by the tide, and then move to attack. If they are badly hurt, they will retreat to their nook Use the following description if the PCs are surprised by the crabs. XP: 150  You catch sudden movement out the corner of your eye. They rock wall below you unfolds with shocking speed into a scuttling tangle of chitinous legs and serrated claws. In between one heartbeat and the next it is upon you, brutal pincers reaching out to crush and rend. 6. Coral Tunnel This tunnel is no more than 3 ft high. The floor is high, and the water level no more than 1 ft. It is dense with spiky, tangled growths of purple coral  Tides: The tides are gentle here because the water is shallow. No rolls are required.  Move successfully through this area requires an excellent sense of body positions and some strange contortions (Acrobatics Check DC 10) every 10 ft. 7. The Tide Pool The stench of rot pervading the rest of the cave is a vague warning of this. It smells like all the worst parts of everything in the sea were stacked here and left to decay. This section of the cave is wide, but oppressively low, just barely head height for a man. To the north there is a steep sandy bank and a large dry section. The water is 2ft. deep, cloud and rank. In the center is the source of the stench. A permanent swirling eddy has deposited the broken remains of every creature pulled into this cavern by the tide. It is a slumping, liquefying pile of shredded flesh, disarticulated bone, organ, eye, and fin, looped and bound with strands of torn kelp. On it and through it, an infestation of crabs writhes and swarms.  Tides: The tides surge every d4 rounds. Athletics check DC 12 to resist. The current here drags PCs towards the fire coral on the south wall, and then along the wall towards passages 5 and 6.  There are 6 Giant crabs, and 6 small crabs here. They will instantly attack anyone entering the room. They will stay under the water, which gives them half cover (+2 AC). They will focus their attack on any character that is prone or poisoned. If the PCs retreat onto the dry area, the crabs will move back into their lair, and wait for them to enter the water again. Two of the large crabs and two of the smaller ones are infected with Sewer Plague (Diseases, DMG p.257). The crabs will not go on to the dry sand in the north section. PCs can safely retreat there. If the Crabs are badly injured, they will retreat to the rotting pile and burrow in. They will attack again if PCs try to take the pile apart. XP:600  The dry section of the cave can be reached by climbing the slope. (Strength DC 12). At the top, the ceiling is only 2 feet high. The crabs cannot reach the PCs here. If the PCs retreat to the dry section the crabs will burrow back into the pile of rotting fish.  The pile of flesh in the center of the room is the center of a wave pattern that picks things up and deposits them here. Most of what it takes in is kelp and fish. Few objects that float survive the rot, but a few interesting things have persisted, most of them from the corpse of a merman, long ago reduced to bone. Finding them requires an success on an Investigation check DC 15. Searchers are also exposed to Sewer Plague. o 4 blown-glass fishing floats: 15 gp. These items are complex to manufacture, and very valuable to fishermen. They are spheres about 1 ft. in diameter. o Waterstone blade: 100 gp, see description in appendix A. o Coral necklace: 40gp o Gold armband with pearl inlay, very intricate high detail work. This armband tells a story in tiny pictures: 60 gp if melted down (much more to the right collector). 8. Shelley’s Lair This is a dome shaped cavern with a 30 ft. high limestone ceiling. Greenish light lances in from a hole at the top. Reflection from the water throws a thousands brilliant light dancing across the ceiling. The surges are much gentler here, baffled by the narrow entrance, and the water swirls gently, only a foot deep at most. At the far end of the room, you can see some dry sand on a patch higher than the rest. There is something at the far end, a brownish shadowed lump. In the center of the room hunches a table-sized boulder, ragged with kelp, barnacles and heavy clumps of mussels.  Tides: The surges here are gentle. PCs are not required to make saves.  The massive boulder, (a) is, in fact, Shelley the crab. Shelley long ago grew to large to leave the chamber. It lives by consuming things that fall through the hole, things washed in by the tide, and crabs foolish enough to wander in. Shelley is not easily recognizable as a crab. It is far too large, and its outline is obscured by encrustations of sea life. It can be spotted with success on a Perception roll DC 18. Shelley rouses slowly, and will begin attack the PCs 1d6 rounds after they enter the room, or immediately if the PCs attack. It is a powerful attacker, and it if can come to grips with the PCs, then it might eat one of them. Shelley’s movement is hampered by the growths on its shell, and it is significantly slower than other crabs. This may allow the PCs to stay ahead of it. Shelley is also not used to food fighting back. It will drop anything it has grappled if it takes damage. If Shelley is reduced to 20 hp or under, it retreats to the deep area near the small tunnel, which is about 8 ft. deep. Shelley large beast, unaligned Armor class: 15 Hit points: 63 Speed: 15 Swim 15 Str 16(+3) Dex 10(+0) Con 13(+1) Int 2(-4) Wis 10(+0) Cha 3(-4) Skills: Stealth +4 Senses: Blindsight 30 ft, passive perception 10 Challenge 2 (450 XP) Amphibious: The crab can breath water and air Actions Multiattack. Shelley makes two attacks, one with each claw. Claw. melee weapon attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. Hit 8 (1d10 +3) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Shelley has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.  The lump in the corner (b) is a skeleton. He is tucked into an alcove in the rock, where Shelley couldn’t get at him. Brown flesh still clings to bone in places. He is wearing rotten leather armor, the remains of good boots, and a long ostrich feather that proclaim him a bit of a dandy. His weapons, a cutlass and a dirk, are cemented into their scabbards with rust. He has 8 gold teeth (30 gp total), a heavy gold and ruby ring (70 gp), a pouch containing 2 pp, 18 gp, 27 silver, and 5 copper, and 2 10gp gems. His leg is obviously badly broken. Near his side is a bottle, sealed with a cork, containing a rolled scrap of thin leather, taken from his armor. Written on the leather are these words. “Last will of me, Renald Triggs, called Boots. Fell throo the dam hole. Legs good and broke. Hid in this corner war she cant get me, but Old Shelley, she wont let me leev. Cud take her if I wasn broken. Wont last long enuf to heel wi-out water. So, my loot goes to whoever finds it, fare and square, so long as ye shar non of it with the worthles rat eeting scum that crews the Ragged Dawn. Left me for dead they did, so be dammed to em.” This is a good spot to insert a treasure map, if you feel so inclined.  The PCs could climb out the cave here, by succeeding on a DC 20 Athletics check. The top of the dome is 30’ high, and PCs will be climbing on the ceiling. However, lime stone is soft and easily accepts pitons and other climbing devices. Failing on the athletics check and falling only causes half damage. PCs fall either onto soft sand or shallow water. 9. Narrow passage Here the cave splits into multiple passages. The water hammers down in great waves from the north, and flows around a corner to the east. From the corner branches a smaller, shallower tunnel, which twists off to the south. The water is deep and powerful here, more than 3 feet deep. It rises to 5 feet during the surges. Fresh sea air and dim blue light flow down from the north.  Tide: The tide here is powerful. Surges every 1d4 rounds. Athletics check DC 15. It is strong enough here that checks are required out of combat. If failing a save would wash a PC over the hole (next section), they are automatically pulled in.  There is a portion of the cave that drops straight down. It is submerged under dark water. On the map, it is marked with a dark spot. It is very hard to see, requiring a Wisdom check DC 20. PCs who step onto the area may make a Dexterity save DC 20. If they fail, they are plunged 15 ft straight down and take d6 points of damage. If there is a tidal surge while they are swimming out, it drives them straight down to the bottom again. This will probably trap at least one character, and PCs will need to work together in order to rescue their party member. 10. Dead End Here the tunnel branches to the east, and slopes sharply down until it is submerged. The water is black and menacing. Tide surges and foams in the mouth of the passage.  Tide: The tide rushes into this hole, pushing anything in it to the bottom. Going into the hole is easy. Getting out requires and Athletics check DC 15.  There is nothing but death in this hole. PCs who swim in may not be able get out again. 11. North Exit Here the cave widens abruptly, and the ceiling rises up at an angle. Bright blue light streams in from a wide cave mouth to the north. Beyond it you can seen thrashing white crested waves, and great limestone pillars and boulders that those waves are slowly pounding into sand. Inside the tunnel, the water pushed and pulled and dragged, but here it is a different beast. Here it lifts, and throws, and threatens to pull you out into the meat grinder of jagged limestone beyond the cave mouth, or back into the cave where the coral waits. It is 50 ft. to the cave mouth through thrashing tide and sharp rock. On the west side of the cave is a narrow sandy ledge that looks as though it is always dry. It looks difficult to walk on, but it leads all the way out to the mouth of the cave.  Tides: The water here is 3 feet deep at the south end, sloping to more than 20 at the north. Tidal surges happen every 1d4 rounds. Swimming here requires a Athletics check DC 17. Failure means that the PC makes no progress, and cannot move or climb out, but is merely pushed back and forth by the swirling water. Swimming during a surge requires a Athletics check DC 20. On a failure, roll a d6. On a 1-3, the character is pushed 30 ft south and takes d6 bludgeoning damage. On a 4-6, the character is dragged 30 ft, north and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage from the rocks.  It is possible to edge along the wall, and climb up the limestone cliff outside the cave. It requires an acrobatics check DC 10 to navigate the edge into a position to climb out. Failure means falling into the water. The limestone is an easy climb, requiring a success on an Athletics Check DC 10.  Be open to other solutions, this is one of those situations where the PCs will come up with something novel. The Waterstone Blade The merfolk have always worked with stone. They have no forges, and besides, the only metal that does not disintegrate in salt water is gold, which is too soft for weaponry. Instead, the merfolk have continued to develop technologies around the chipping and shaping of volcanic glasses. Waterstone is one such glass. It comes from volcanic vents in the deepest abyssal trenches, shaped by intense heat and unimaginable pressure. It is perfectly sharp and nearly indestructible. It is rarely found in pieces larger than your baby fingernail. These are set into handles of coral or bone to make serrated knives. This knife functions more or less like a normal one, with two exceptions. First, it never needs sharpening. Second, waterstone is harder and sharper than just about anything. Given time, a man with a waterstone knife can saw through a stone, or metal bars, or plate steel. Used as a saw, it does 1 hp. of damage per round to any non magical substance, and some magical ones (DMs discretion). Its value of 100gp is what someone mostly ignorant of its uses will pay for it as a display piece, for these knives are always works of art. However, a dwarven craftsman will pay up to 500 gp for a waterstone blade because of its rarity and excellent use as a tool.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
