IN THE SERPENT’S GAZE 1 IN THE SERPENT’S GAZE AN ADVENTURE FOR ANY CAMPAIGN SETTING Introduction: The outpost of Crooktree on the edge of the Verdant Jungle has had a rough start. While they have found plenty of resources with which to build, members of the expedition have been disappearing. On top that, lizardfolk from a nearby village have been testing the waters with brief raids. Can the adventurers deal with the lizardfolk threat and discover the truth about the disappearances? This adventure is meant for a party of 3 RD-5 TH level adventurers. It is intended to be able to be inserted into any campaign setting.

IN THE SERPENT’S GAZE 2 Introduction The outpost of Crooktree has only recently been established on the outskirts of the Verdant Jungle. A small expeditionary company has come to see if resources can be gleaned from the ominous and dangerous region. However, several members of the nascent community have gone missing and there have been attacks from a nearby tribe of lizardfolk. The outpost may fade away before it even begins to turn a profit. The outpost turns to a band of intrepid adventurers to see if there is something that can be done about the lizardfolk and what has happened to their missing companions. The Expeditionary Company The company that first set forth from the capital was chartered by a team of investors back at the capital and charged with establishing a profitable outpost to plumb the resources of the Verdant Jungle. The hope was that the outpost would grow into a thriving, profitable, community. The investors make up a variety of affluent and influential folk back in the capital. The investors govern the company through a board which sends directives from time to time and expect reports on the company’s progress. The person responsible for these reports and enacting these directives is Director Tamisin Brookwine. The expeditionary company was comprised of the following folk: • Director Tamisin Brookwine: This halfling is a respected ranger and veteran of other expeditionary companies (see Appendix- Foes and Encounters for more details). • Glowhand: A firbolg druid, Glowhand serves as the primary healer for the expedition (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters for more details). He is whimsical and laconic. • Ellywick Scrum: A knowledgeable herbalist and horticulturalist, this forest gnome is the plant expert for the expedition. • Darsithonel Argathson: Dar is a half-elven ranger and is Tamisin’s right-hand (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters for more details). • Baern Dankil: A hill dwarf, Baern is a skilled smith and the lead craftsperson for the company. • Maerys Dunning: Maerys hopes to establish a mercantile store in the outpost, as well as a trade route to supply it. This human also assists Tamisin with her accounting skills. • Samden Brask: This human is the captain of the contingent of guards that were brought along on the expedition for protection (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters for more details). Along with these named characters, the expedition brought a band of six (6) guards for protection along the way. These guards now act as a militia for the outpost (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters for more details on the guards). There was also a small team of artisans: carpenters, potters, and the like that were to help establish the outpost and provide needed tools and other materials for the company. There is a dozen (12) of these folks. Crooktree The outpost of Crooktree was established approximately six months ago. It is named for a large tree whose trunk somehow grew warped and was used as a landmark when the expedition first arrived. The actual “crooked tree” sits at the center of the outpost. What began as a tent city has now established rustic wooden buildings and is starting to look more and more like the beginnings of a town. Water can be had from a nearby stream. The land is fertile and simply needs to be cleared of overgrowth to make excellent farmland. The nearby jungle provides abundant wood, herbs, and other resources that the expedition was hoping to find. The mercantile of the outpost can be a source of very basic supplies—nothing from the standard equipment list worth over 25 gold pieces (see the PHB) will be available there. The Hungry Jungle Several members of the community have gone missing after brief forays into the nearby Verdant Jungle. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. IN THE SERPENT’S GAZE 3 • Cali Demmer, a young herbalist, disappeared about a week after the expedition arrived. She had gone in to find a rare flower she was hoping was more abundant in the wilds of the jungle. She was seen going in, but she never returned. She was known for her piercing blue eyes. • Kalten Fann, a carpenter, disappeared about a month after the expedition arrived. Kalten had gone in to find some sturdy wood to begin building the healer’s hut and never returned. • Sylus Aelen and Bragara Mundy both disappeared about two weeks ago. With the other disappearances, Tamisin had implemented a strict “buddy system” for entering the encroaching wild. Sylus was a potter looking for a better base for his clay and Bragara was one of the guards that elected to accompany him. Neither have been seen since. Neighborly Relations The prime suspects of the disappearances are a nearby tribe of lizardfolk that have made a couple of attacks on the outpost in the past month. They seem to be testing the waters, as it were. The raiders mostly come in small groups—no more than six at a time. There have been no fatalities, but some injuries—so far. Dar has tracked some of the lizardfolk back into the jungle and discovered the location of their village. It lies about an hour’s walk to the west of the outpost. There are approximately fifty of the creatures in residence there. The Crux of the Problem Tamisin wonders that if the lizardfolk are responsible for the disappearances, what are they doing with their prisoners? There is no trace of her people left—no tracks and no bodies. The lizardfolk seem like the type to be content to let their kills lie. Are they responsible for the disappearances? Or is something else going on in the shadows of the jungle? She doesn’t want to keep sending people into the jungle to have them just disappear and she is hesitant to travel en masse with the guards, leaving the outpost unprotected. Introducing the Adventure There are several ways a DM could introduce this adventure to their PCs. Here are a few suggestions. The Pros from Dover The PCs could be an adventuring company hired by the board back in the capital sent to assist the outpost in this matter. The board will pay the party a total of 500 gold pieces—250 now, 250 upon their final report. Welcome to the Team! The PCs could be members of the original expeditionary party that have been tapped by Tamisin to explore further into the jungle and discover the nature of the threat to the outpost. What a Coincidence! If the PCs are exploring near the area, they could happen upon the outpost and want to help Tamisin out with her problems. Regardless of why, the DM should see to it that the PCs are ready to head into the jungle and seek out the lizardfolk village and solve the mystery of the disappearances. Not for resale.

He can give the party directions to get there. It lies about an hour to the west of the outpost. He will also warn them of the dangers of razorvine along the way. Traveling through the jungle will ensure that during all encounters, the party is in difficult terrain and moves at half speed. Encounter One: Razorvine As the party travels through the thick Verdant Jungle, they will encounter a wall of razorvine that they must traverse safely before continuing onward. To see the razorvine before it is encountered, the PC in the lead of the expedition must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check. Otherwise, the first character to encounter the wall must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d10) slashing damage from the plant’s bladelike thorns. The 10 ft. high, 10 ft. wide, 5 ft. thick wall has an AC 11, 25 hit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage. Dar’s path through the razorvine can be found with a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) or DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. Encounter Two: Seeing the Forest for the Trees Soon after the razorvine incident, have the lead PC make a Wisdom (Survival) check at DC 15. Success means that they have not gotten lost. Failure means that the party has become lost. Another check can be made in 1d6 hours to see if the party can get back on track. If the party does get lost along the way, have them encounter the following: The Awakened Tree calls itself “Arboreon” (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters) and has lived in this forest for centuries. He can give them the following information, with a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check. • The proper directions to the lizardfolk village. • There are other strange reptilian folk traversing the jungle. There are whispers in the leaves of abominations living in the ruins deeper within. • Two of the strange reptilian folk came through here with human prisoners not long ago. Of course, “not long” could be about two weeks to a long-lived being like Arboreon. • He was “awakened” by strange magics that came from deep within the jungle long ago. He remembers a wave of warm energy, like blue and green sunlight, pouring over him and then he was awake. Any display of fire will shut down the conversation and even make Arboreon angry enough to attack to get the fire away from him. Encounter Three: Lizardfolk Ambush The party will encounter a pair of lizardfolk (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters) as they make their way through the thick jungle. The lizardfolk are hiding in the thick foliage. The party can spot the ambush on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, they will be surprised during the first round of combat. These lizardfolk can be easily tracked back to their village with a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check. There are no treasures to be found on the two creatures. The jungle is thick with vines, branches, and roots from the densely placed trees that make up the forest. The air is thick with moisture and heat—you can feel sweat running down your backs beneath your armor and gathering on your brows as your force your way through the thick wilderness. The odor of fresh earth and the aroma of exotic flowering plants fill your nostrils. The going is slow as you must clear your path along the way. One of the ancient trees suddenly, and inexplicably, yawns. It slowly twists its trunk to where it seems to be facing you all. “Salutations…travelers…” it says, its voice low and resonant. “What brings you to…my home…” Two powerfully-built green-skinned reptilian humanoids burst from the surrounding trees. Colorful fins run from the top of their scaly heads to the bottom of their wide necks. They both wield shields and heavy clubs. Not for resale.

IN THE SERPENT’S GAZE 5 Negotiating with the Lizardfolk Lizardfolk are very territorial and will fight and kill mercilessly to defend what they claim as their own. However, they are also in awe of magic. This could be used in the party’s favor. Further, lizardfolk often worship and serve dragons. If the party has one of the Dragonborn traveling with them, that is another fact that they could use to their advantage. The Lizardfolk Village The lizardfolk village is a nestled in a small valley in the jungle. It is surrounded by a dense wall of thorny vines that only the lizardfolk have found paths through. However, characters that are tracking the previously encountered lizardfolk can track them to one of the entry trails on a DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check. Otherwise, finding one will require a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check. These lizardfolk are led by their chieftain, Jhank (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters). Jhank is a particularly large lizardfolk that rules with a strange sense of honor amongst their folk. The lizardfolk are also guided by their shaman, Sauriv (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters). The lizardfolk of the village are defended by about 20 lizardfolk warriors. The rest are the old, infirm, or the young. Chieftain’s Hut Here Jhank lives with her lizardfolk consort, Kepesk. There is not much in the hut—a large bed, a table with four chairs, a rotted tapestry depicting an ancient battle, and a basin. Hidden in a panel in the floor, requiring a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to find, is a small chest. Treasure: The chest contains 36 gp, 27 sp, 55 cp, and an assortment of small gemstones with a total worth of 50 gp. Shaman’s Hut Sauriv lives here alone, contemplating the strange source of her magics. There is a small bed, a small stone shrine, a large rug (stolen from a human traveler), and a small table with two chairs. Hidden beneath the shrine, requiring a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to find, is a small chest. Treasure: The chest contains 57 gp, 11 ep, 23 sp, 68 cp, and an assortment of small gemstones with a total worth of 100 gp. Further, Sauriv has two potions of healing stashed here. Brood Chamber Near the center of the village is a large structure where the lizardfolk of the village keep their eggs. This chamber is zealously guarded at all times by a group of six (6) lizardfolk. Encounters with the Lizardfolk The party will probably approach the lizardfolk in one of two ways: the carrot and the stick. The Carrot Should the party attempt to communicate with the lizardfolk instead of outright attacking them, they could learn the following: • The “serpent folk” have been coming from the ruins further to the west and taking the village’s warriors as slaves. • The lizardfolk have not been kidnapping people from the outpost—they have no use for weaklings in their village. • The ruins are about two days walk to the west through the jungle. The lizardfolk avoid them at all costs because they are “haunted.” Further, if the adventurers prove themselves to be strong and capable, Jhank may even be willing to ally with the party to stop the incursions of the “serpent folk” on her village. She will swear to leave the outpost alone in exchange for the party dealing with the yuan-ti problem. However, if the party goes back on their word, there will be a terrible vengeance taken against the outpost. The Stick The party may just attack the lizardfolk village and hope to wipe out the perceived threat to the outpost. Doing so may cause them to be unaware Potion of Healing This common potion heals the imbiber by 2d4+2 hit points. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. IN THE SERPENT’S GAZE 6 that there is a greater threat waiting deeper in the jungle (i.e. the yuan-ti). If the party takes this approach, have them witness a band of yuan-ti come into the village and take one of the lizardfolk by force. The more human-looking of the band are yuan-ti purebloods (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters). They are led by a type 1 yuan-ti malison (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters). The party may or may not interfere with the kidnapping. If so, they will be in for a pretty big battle. Two of the yuan-ti purebloods will make off with the lizardfolk prisoner while the fight is going on, leaving only one pureblood and the malison behind. If things get too hairy with the yuan-ti, have some lizardfolk warriors come in to give them aid. Four strange figures emerge from beyond the thorny wall that surrounds the village. Three almost look human—two males and one female. However, their eyes have serpentine slits for pupils and their pale green skin bears patches of light iridescent scales that catch the sunlight. The fourth is the strangest of all. This humanoid has a broad, strong stocky human body topped with a scaly snake’s head. A red flickering tongue emerges periodically from the creature’s lipless mouth. It wields a scimitar and carries a longbow with a quiver of arrows on its back. The more human of the creatures grab one of the guards and quickly subdue him, spraying poison in his face to bring him down. The snake-headed one stands watch, warily waiting for others to come. The others gather up the warrior and start carrying him back into the jungle through the thorny wall, followed by the snake-headed one. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. IN THE SERPENT’S GAZE 7 The Heart of Darkness The party, at some point, should be convinced that the more trouble lies deeper in the jungle. Whether or not they’ve allied with the lizardfolk or simply witnessed the yuan-ti first hand, they should be ready to delve into the heart of darkness. If the party has encountered the yuan-ti kidnappers at the lizardfolk village, they could try to follow them to their lair. To do so undetected, they will need to roll Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Take the lowest of the party and compare to the Passive Perception of the yuan-ti purebloods (DC 13). If the party’s Stealth is lower than 13, the yuan-ti will notice them following and take appropriate action. To track the yuan-ti back to their lair, the lead PC will need to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check to pick up the trail. The PCs could also receive directions to the ruins from the lizardfolk. If so, have the lead PC make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check once per day to avoid getting lost. Getting lost will add 1d6 hours to their journey and require a second Wisdom (Survival) check to get back on track. The journey to the ruins will take two days. Day One: Encounter One The party is being attacked by a Vine Blight plus six (6) Awakened Shrubs (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters). Day One: Encounter Two This encounter against two (2) Giant Wolf Spiders (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters) takes place at night. Hopefully, at least one member of the party is on watch… If someone is on watch, allow them a Wisdom (Perception) check against a DC of 17 to spot the spiders before they descend from the trees. Otherwise, the watchers are caught off-guard and cannot attack the first round. Should the party decide to climb up into the trees to see the spider’s webs—which will require a Strength (Athletics) check of DC 10 to do successfully—they will see some desiccated bodies of past victims wound up in the webbing. Searching the parties with a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check will yield three (3) potions of healing, a gold ring (worth 15 gp), and a periapt of wound closure. Day Two: Encounter One Depending on how the party approaches Eilonwy (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters), she could become a useful ally. She will be attracted to the PC with the highest Charisma score and be curious as to who they are what they are doing. She may even try to charm the PC and convince them to come with her to her demesne—a great tree deeper in the jungle. As you make your way through the thick growth of jungle vines and roots that comprise this part of the trail, you are surprised to find that the vines are moving beneath your feet and reaching out to entangle you! You look over and see the shrubbery closing in to finish you off… The jungle is clearly alive at night—maybe even more alive when darkness descends than during the day. You hear distant calls of apes and wolves and…other creatures you can’t identify. You hear the skkkktttchch of insect legs rubbing together. You swear sometimes you see the glow of eyes out in the shadows. You feel a light touch on your shoulder and look to see what is there and follow a long arachnoid leg heading up to a human-sized spider hanging directly over you! Three more are descending on dark webs into the camp… Periapt of Wound Closure Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, when you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it restores. As you slog through the thick jungle, the heat making sweat pour off your brow and pool in pockets within your armor, you catch the glimpse of a distinctly feminine form gliding from tree to tree. Her warm laughter trickles on the air like water… Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. IN THE SERPENT’S GAZE 8 Conversely, the party could convince her of the dangers her neighbors present. They will have to convince that the yuan-ti present a particular danger to the forest in order to solicit her aid. This may be difficult at this point, not having much idea as to who the yuan-ti are yet. Eilonwy has seen the yuan-ti moving about in the jungle, as well as the lizardfolk and other predators. They are all just doing what comes natural to them…but the yuan-ti. Something is unnatural about them. They are warped and ugly and Eilonwy doesn’t like them. If threatened, she has spells at her disposal and will use her charm ability to solicit the sympathy and aid of one of the party. She may just run away. Either way, she will likely not engage in one-on- one combat with the party. If ignored, she will continue to follow the party all the way to the ruins. Normally, Eilonwy avoids the ruins—the yuan-ti are not of interest to her. But the party—well now, they are far more interesting than those ugly old snake people, aren’t they? As a result, it could be that Eilonwy could come to their aid later in the adventure. Day Two: Encounter Two The sun is going down when the adventurers reach the ruins. They may opt to make a camp before descending the bluff into the valley with the ruins. Or, they may go ahead and descend at night. Regardless, during this night they will encounter a patrol of four (4) yuan-ti purebloods (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters) making their way about the perimeter of the bluff. The Ruins The descent down the bluff into the valley is not terribly difficult but can pose a challenge if the party doesn’t find a trail. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check will allow the party to find such a trail and descend the bluff with relative ease. Without a trail, each character should make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to see if they can make their way. Failure means that they slip and take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and roll to the bottom of the valley. Exploring the Ruins Exploring the ruins will require the person leading the expedition (or, if the party breaks up into groups, the leader of each group) to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. For each even number over 10, add one to their roll on the following table (+1 for 12-13, +2 for 14-15, +3 for 16-17, +4 for 18-29, +5 for 20-21, etc.). Each foray/roll on the table represents 1d4 hours of exploration time.

Tired and sweaty, you continue just a bit further and come to the edge of a bluff. Looking down the steep descent, you see a deep valley in which stone buildings, clearly ancient and of strange design, are threatened to be engulfed by the greenery of the surrounding jungle. The lush valley is filled with ancient stone edifices that have crumbled over time and have become overcome with vines and roots from the surrounding overgrowth. Most of the buildings are completely ruined, though some do still stand and could serve some function. The layout of the ancient city is a labyrinth of trails between the overgrown stones. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. IN THE SERPENT’S GAZE 9 ruined buildings. The stone edifices are covered in ivy and thorny vines. There are strange symbols carved on some of the structures. Those that can read Abyssal recognize them as runes of demonic protection and warning. Slave Pen with Guards: The party comes upon a largeish structure whose opening has been blocked by a steel grate affixed to the entrance. It is clear that the grate was affixed much more recently than the when the structure was built. There is a group of four (4) yuan-ti purebloods (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters) guarding the entrance. Inside the structure are 3 lizardfolk and two humans: Sylus Aelen and Bragara Mundy from Crooktree. They all look like they have been treated poorly and are malnourished. If freed, Sylus and Bragara will tell how they were magically induced to follow the yuan-ti deeper into the jungle and were eventually subdued by violence and taken here. They have seen Kalten Fann with the yuan-ti from time to time, when they come to the surface from their lair. He is treated as an oft-beaten slave. They have not seen Cali Demmer. There have also been lizardfolk being brought in and taken below as slaves as well. The lizardfolk will be wary and hostile unless the party can somehow communicate their benevolent intent to them. Occupied Building with 2d4 Yuan-Ti Purebloods: The purebloods who are left on the surface of the ruins use some of the buildings as residences. They will defend their homes fiercely. If attacked, one of the purebloods will attempt to get away to alert the other yuan-ti of the party’s presence (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters). Treasure: In any one occupied house, the following treasure could be found with a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check: 2d10 gold pieces, 1d6 electrum pieces, 2d10 silver pieces, 2d20 copper pieces. Entrance to the Ziggurat of the Yuan-ti: The main portion of the Yuan-ti settlement resides in a large ziggurat within the labyrinthine city. The party will have to climb the crumbling and ivy-covered stairs of the outer structure to arrive at the true entrance. There are, indeed two (2) Yuan-ti malison (type 1) at the top of the ziggurat standing guard (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters). If the malisons spot the party or are attacked, one will try to get inside the ziggurat to warn their masters, sounding a gong in area A of the ziggurat whose reverberations carry down the stairs. • If the gong is sounded, two (2) of the Yuan-ti malisons (type 2) that are in room number 2 will arrive in 2d4 rounds (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters). Before stands an impressive ziggurat made of stone. The outer steps are crumbling in places and covered in ivy and other clinging plants. The structure is some fifty feet in height, narrowing at the top to a small arched entryway. You can also see two strong- bodied snake-headed warriors standing watch on the top level. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. IN THE SERPENT’S GAZE 10 The Ziggurat of the Yuan-ti The halls of the ziggurat, unless otherwise noted, are dark. The temperature is cool—much more comfortable than being out in the jungle and ruins. There is a musty odor that covers something much more sinister—the sickly-sweet smell of decay— that is carried on the air. The stench gets more distinct as the PCs descend further into the structure (see Appendix-Maps for more details). Top Level (A) 1. Entry Chamber The two guards posted outside are the primary security for this area. The secondary security is the dart trap set in the far alcove of the chamber. Poison Dart Trap: Stepping on a tile in the far corner of the chamber, facing the alcove, triggers a series of four darts to be fired by compressed air from the back wall of the alcove. Ranged Weapon Attack. +4 to hit. Range 15 ft.; 2 darts per creature in 10 ft. wide area. Hit: 3 (1d4+2) piercing damage plus 6 (2d6) poison damage (CON save vs. DC 12 for half poison damage). The trap’s trigger can be found with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or Intelligence (Investigation) check. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check can also determine the means by which to deactivate the trap. Deactivating the trap yields 50 xp. Second Level (B) 2. Malison Barracks This chamber usually sleeps six (6) Malisons in their snake forms. At any one time there are usually two (2) Type 1 Malisons, two (2) Type 2 Malisons, and two (2) Type 3 Malisons. • If the gong is sounded upstairs, the two Type 2 Malisons will go to address the problem, while the others are placed on guard, taking on their humanoid forms and grabbing their weapons from the racks. Otherwise, all six Malisons are sleeping in their snake forms. • One of the Type 3 Malisons has the key to the Armory door. 3. Armory The door is locked (DC 25 to unlock with Thieves’ Tools). One of the Type 3 Malisons in the previous chamber has the key. This room is used as an armory by the malisons of the Yuan-ti settlement. This room contains 6 scimitars, 4 longbows, and a total of 60 arrows. 4. Secret Chamber This chamber’s entrance is a panel disguised as a mosaic depicting a great serpent wrapping itself around the world. The panel can be found on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check. The panel also has two very small eyeholes through which an observer from behind the panel can see into the corridor. The chamber is often occupied by Tsesk, a Yuan- ti Mind Whisperer who is constantly watching both prisoners and his own people (see Appendix- Foes and Encounters). He found the secret chamber and has kept it as his own personal observation area, not revealing its whereabouts to anyone. There is a 75% chance at any time that Tsesk is present in the chamber. Otherwise, he is in his drawing room (Chamber 6). If he observes the party making their way down the corridor from his vantage point, he will attempt to fall in behind them unobserved and attack by surprise. The entrance to the ziggurat has definitely seen better days. The marble floor is pockmarked and scratched. There is also windblown debris littering the floor. The walls bear mosaics depicting these strange serpent creatures you’ve encountered coming into this very building bearing baskets of fruit, gemstones, and other gifts. At the top of the ziggurat, (as depicted in the mosaic) is a great serpent wearing a high golden headdress adorned with gems. There is a large brass gong standing within an iron stand at the head of the steps that lead down into the ziggurat proper. This chamber is fairly unadorned except for some forgotten mosaics on the walls that have so many tiles missing that it is impossible to interpret what was shown there in the ziggurat’s heyday. Otherwise, the room is unfurnished save for some iron weapon racks affixed to the back wall. This chamber is unadorned except for some iron weapon racks affixed to the stone walls. The racks have obviously been affixed much more recently than the building of the ziggurat. The racks contain scimitars, longbows, and baskets containing arrows. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. IN THE SERPENT’S GAZE 11 5. Tsesk’s Bedchamber The door to this chamber is generally locked, with only Tsesk himself having the key. This Tsesk the Mind Whisperer’s bedchamber. Here he keeps his few treasures and takes pleasure with slaves and Yuan-ti truebloods as is his right. The Yuan-ti pureblood (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters) slumbering in his bed is one such “pet.” If awakened, the pureblood will attack. Treasure: Secreted in a panel in the base of the bed is a small coffer. This secret panel can be found with a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check. A second check of the same difficulty will be required to spot the poison dart trap on the panel. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check will allow someone to figure out how to deactivate the trap. The trap launches a small poisoned dart: Ranged Weapon Attack. +4 to hit. Target: one creature. Hit: 2 (1d4) piercing damage and 3 (1d6) poison damage (CON save vs. DC 12 for half poison damage). The coffer contains 8 platinum, 55 gold, and 27 silver, and a fist-sized ruby worth 500 gold pieces. 6. Small Shrine This is a drawing room for Tsesk to entertain guests and the worship chamber for the Mind Whisperer to commune with Sseth, the Sibilant Death. • If Tsesk (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters) was not in the secret chamber (chamber 4), then Tsesk will be kneeling in supplication at the obelisk. The obelisk has a small secret panel in the rear portion of the granite base. Finding it requires a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check. The panel is not trapped. Inside are three potions: a potion of greater healing, oil of etherealness, and potion of heroism. This chamber is adorned with an elaborate mosaic depicting a snake-headed humanoid accepting gifts from other humanoid races who debase themselves before it. There is a large bed with silken sheets sitting at the far end of the room. Lying in the bed is a slumbering Yuan- ti pureblood. He snores loudly. There is also an elaborately woven carpet on the floor and tapestries with alien geometric designs woven into them on the walls. The walls of this chamber have mosaics with missing tiles but that can still be seen to depict various Yuan-ti performing a variety of tasks: in battle, in supplication to their dark gods, and in daily work. A low table sits in the main portion of the chamber with a long settee running parallel to it and two other plush chairs flanking it. The far alcove in the chamber houses a marble obelisk on a granite base. The obelisk has the symbol of Sseth inscribed in gold upon its face—a winged serpent with bared fangs. Before the obelisk is a padded rug of red velvet. Potion of Greater Healing This uncommon potion heals the imbiber by 4d4+4 hit points. Oil of Etherealness Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour. Potion of Heroism For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the bless spell (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling. Not for resale. Permission granted to print or photocopy this document for personal use only. IN THE SERPENT’S GAZE 12 Bottom Level (C) 7. Guarded Alcove This landing is unadorned and nondescript. As one steps off the stairway leading down, there is a trap in the floor that can only be deactivated by pulling a lever in a secret panel in the left-hand wall of the stairwell. A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check will find the panel. Otherwise, the pit trap is active. Pit Trap: The panel of the pit trap can be discerned by a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check. Otherwise, the trapped panel of floor is 8 ft. square in the center of the corridor. The pit itself is 10 ft. deep and ends in poisoned spikes. Those that fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw will take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2d10) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) poison damage (half poison damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw). If the trap is deactivated, then award 75 xp. However, standing watch in the far side of the alcove is a Type 3 Malison (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters). If he witnesses the trap going off, he will slither into the next chamber to warn those inside. 8. Conclave of the Yuan-ti These two chambers make up the primary meeting place for the Yuan-ti who run this settlement. It is made up of two chambers—the main chamber (8a) and an antechamber (8b). 8a: Main Chamber The occupants of this room may have been warned of the party’s arrival by the Malison standing guard in the alcove. If so, they will be on their guard. Otherwise, the party may be able to approach unseen. The figure on the cushions that appears to be a type 3 Malison is actually a Yuan-ti Nightmare Speaker named Ssheshek (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters). Attending her are two Yuan-ti Broodguards (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters). One has unusually bright blue eyes…it is the warped body of Calli Demmer. If the Type 3 Malison from the alcove room (chamber 7) came to warn the Ssheshek of the incoming danger, he will also be in the room. 8b: Broodguard Chamber These two (2) Yuan-ti Broodguards (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters) have been set here to guard the room against all comers save for the Yuan-ti priests that rule this domain. There are two secret doors in this room. Either could be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check. Both doors pivot and swing inward to the next room. Both have a poison dart trap set to attack anyone who opens the door without also pulling the small trigger in the wall that must be found in a subsequent successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check. Poison Dart Trap: Ranged Weapon Attack. +4 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage plus 6 (2d6) poison damage (half poison damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw). This large chamber is supported by four broad stone columns. The walls are adorned with intricate mosaics depicting Yuan-ti subjugating the various races of the world and bringing them low. The columns are cunningly carved to resemble intertwining serpents. In the center of the room is a large circle of cushions. Sitting upon it is a creature with a humanoid head and torso with the legless bottom half of a serpent. She is being attended by two warped-looking humanoid serpents. The strange humanoids’ eyes narrow in rage as their eyes fall upon you and they begin moving forward. One of them have strangely bright blue eyes that blaze with an unholy hatred as she moves toward you with murderous intent… This room is unadorned and empty save for two of those warped scaly humanoids you saw in the previous chamber. They hiss and begin stalking toward with violence in their eyes… Making a Broodguard Yuan-ti create broodguards from captured humanoids. Each subject is fed a special potion that immediately renders it incapacitated and transforms it into a broodguard over the next 1d6 + 6 days. A subject forced to imbibe the brew can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw; on a success, it takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and isn’t otherwise affected. A spell such as lesser restoration or remove curse can end the transformation process at any time before it runs its course. After the process is complete, only a wish spell can reverse the effect.

Brood Chamber This is where the Yuan-ti of this settlement are incubating their eggs. The Yuan-ti Pureblood in the room (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters) will do everything in her power to protect these eggs. This may mean that negotiation is possible. Otherwise she attacks in a frenzy of desperation and hatred. 10. More Broodguards This room is occupied by four (4) of the Yuan-ti Broodguards (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters). 11. The Changing Chamber This Yuan-ti, who is actually a Yuan-ti Pit Master named Pesshak (see Appendix-Foes and Encounters). He is about to turn poor Kalten into one of the monstrous Broodguards the party has been fighting. They should suspect that this was the fate of Calli Demmer. Aftermath With the three priests that rule over the other Yuan-ti in the settlement (primarily the few malisons and purebloods in the upper city) now dispatched, the settlement is essentially broken. The remaining Yuan-ti will leave to seek new masters and spread their cruelty elsewhere—or perhaps return with others someday to enact their revenge. Only time will tell… When the party eventually returns to Crooktree, they are given a hero’s welcome—especially if they have managed to save Kalten, Sylus, and Bragara. There will be a proper mourning for young Calli, who met a horrible fate. Regardless of how the PCs were drawn into the adventure, Tamisin will offer them a “bonus” of 500 gold pieces as well as a letter of recommendation from the expeditionary company that could be used as a reference when looking for future work. As far as the lizardfolk village, if the party managed to negotiate with them for a peace, Jhank will be true to her word—with the threat of the Yuan-ti gone, she will leave the outpost of Crooktree alone—provided they show her village the same courtesy. The floor of this chamber houses approximately eighteen eggs, lined up in neat rows, sitting upright from their larger end. The shells have the iridescent sheen of scales upon their otherwise white covering. Braziers burn at the corners of the room, making the quite warm. A female Yuan-ti pureblood looks up from examining the eggs as the door opens… This chamber is largely unadorned—the mosaics that used to cover the walls have long since lost most of their colorful tiles. The large room is guarded by four of the warped scaly humanoids you’ve started encountering on this level of the ziggurat. A staircase descends from the room to another area. The staircase descends into a brief corridor that turns into a moderately-sized chamber. At the far end of the chamber is a set of steps that lead to a raised round platform containing a large statue of a flying snake with bared fangs. Before the statue is a cauldron on top of a bed of flames. Standing near the cauldron is a Yuan-ti with a humanoid head and body but with snakes for arms. The snakes are currently entwined around the neck of Kalten Fann, the carpenter from Crooktree. His eyes are wide with terror as the creature’s other appendages dip a ladle into the cauldron and begin to hold it to Kalten’s lips. Not for resale.
