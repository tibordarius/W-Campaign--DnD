As a result, there are a few options for play: Each adventure can be used in a standalone way. Any time the adventurers are at sea, one of these adventures can be inserted into the set- ting being used. Alternatively, these episodes can be strung together into a larger, ongoing campaign. They have been written with this idea in mind, and the ongoing threat from the Far Realms creates the basic through-line to the larger campaign. Well-meaning DMs should also prepare their players: Because many of these adventures have a personal thrust to them (the betrayal of good friends, the splitting of one’s own personality, etc.), Dungeon Masters and players should communicate about how much each is com- fortable with. If, for example a player doesn’t want to temporarily lose the agency of their character, or if your players aren’t interested in PC vs. PC matchups, maybe the adventure needs to be tweaked. The episode numbers refer to the recom- mended order of play, if played as a whole campaign. But some may be moved out of or- der as needed. EPISODE 3: THE TRAVELING SALESMAN A rescue mission that isn’t as simple as it looks at first—this traveling salesman has more in his wares than he at first lets on. ADVENTURE SUMMARY A small ship has been stolen, and the crew aboard her can’t stay afloat. The party attempts to rescue them, but loses the stolen ship in the process, if not their own ship. They begin to re- turn the thief, a satyr and self-described travel- ing salesman named Henenu Ferghus Loyb, to the authorities. But along the way, he hasn’t given up on his schemes, and his “cargo,” three beautiful women, also are more than they seem. They are directed to a port, an island popu- lated by miners, some of whom take a liking to the salesman’s cargo and steal them for them- selves. As they pursue the miners and the women, they discover that Loyb has a potion he has been giving them to make them more alluring, as part of a con. In reality, they are yuan-ti purebloods, disguised and enhanced by the potion to lull their victims, until they can trans- form into large constrictor snakes, devour their ”husbands,” and leave with their wealth, resuming the con again somewhere else. (To be fair to Loyb, he doesn’t know how often the men are killed. Any time he knows about it, he believes that his women were acting in self-de- fense. He assumes they merely rob them.) When the party rescues the charmed miners, they are rewarded with treasure and repairs as needed. When they turn Loyb in to the authori- ties, they are provided a sizeable monetary re- ward. RUNNING THE ADVENTURE To run this adventure, you need the D&D fifth edition core rulebooks (Player’s Handbook, Dun- geon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual). Most of the monsters that appear in this adven- ture are from the Monster Manual, with adjust- ments made to some, including some from Volo’s Guide to Monsters. When a creature’s name appears in bold type, that’s a visual cue pointing you to its stat block in the Monster Manual. T Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text. 4 SEA TRAVELING Spells and equipment mentioned in the ad- venture are described in the Player’s Handbook. Magic items are described in the Dungeon Mas- ter’s Guide, unless the adventure’s text directs you to an item’s description in another book or in the Appendix. ADVENTURE HOOKS Whatever hook used for the adventure, it is suggested that you have some wanted posters sprinkled around earlier in your campaign for the smuggler Henenu Ferghus Loyb, asking for a sizeable reward for him alive. A much smaller reward (90% smaller) is offered for his dead body. BOUNTY HUNTING Assuming there have been several posters available advertising the reward for Henenu Ferghus Loyb, the most straightforward hook would be to have rumors of him surface for the party. He recently stole a ship from a port they know, headed in a direction they can track. THE STOLEN SHIP The party has contacts, a benefactor or other adventuring party they know, whose ship was just robbed. Either the whole ship or a jolly boat was stolen from it, and they’re hoping the party will go after the thieves, who are, of course, Loyb and his cargo. HELP! The adventure could begin as simply as a ran- dom encounter, in which the party coinci- dentally comes across Loyb in his ship in their travels. Initially they believe it to be simply a rescue mission until they look into his past more closely. In this case, there’s no need to make mention that Loyb’s ship was stolen, un- less you wish to make this a feature of the ad- venture later. ACT I—THIS IS MY CARGO Either by happenstance, or at the end of their hunt for Henenu Ferghus Loyb and his stolen ship, the party finds his stolen ship trapped in a whirlpool. Loyb is a satyr, and each of his companions is a yuan-ti pureblood with the shapechanger ability, described below, taken from Volo’s Guide to Monsters: The following rules are adapted from Ghosts of Saltmarsh. The whirlpool is 50 feet in diameter, 25 feet in depth. The velocity of its waves is 15 feet per PLACING THE ADVENTURE As mentioned, these voyages can find a home in any sea-based campaign. It’s recommended that the party have their own ship and a base of opera- tions. The town of Saltmarsh in the Greyhawk campaign setting is an excellent choice, but any location with a need for seafaring adventurers will do. This adventure takes place in a not-unpopu- lated area of the sea. It should be several days from the party’s home port, but with islands big and small accessible and known to the party or most cartographers. SHAPECHANGER YUAN-TI PUREBLOOD The yuan-ti can use its action to polymorph into a Medium giant poisoinous snake, or into a Large constrictor stnake, or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the size change noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It doesn’t change form if it dies. THE TRAVELING SALESMAN 5 round. The ship occupied by Loyb is just inside the outer edge of the whirlpool, being dragged in. Alternatively, he can have noticed the ap- proach of the party and steered the ship into the whirlpool in a misguided attempt to es- cape. In either case, he will not be able to break free of the pull of the vortex. It is probable that the party’s ship will also need to enter the whirlpool to pull Loyb free. You can roll Initiative for this encounter, or simply assume the PCs and their ship will move first, and Loyb, his party and ship, will move next. All whirlpool-related DCs are 10. Creatures in the whirlpool must make a Strength (Athletics) check to move normally in the waters. Failure means that the creature is dragged 15 feet towards the center of the whirlpool and is restrained until the start of the creature’s next turn. Vessels in the whirlpool must make group checks. The captain must make an Intelligence (water vehicles) check; the first mate must make a Charisma (Intimidation) check; the bo- sun must make a Strength (carpenter’s tools) check), and the quartermaster must make a Wisdom (Nature) check. Also, roll a d20 for the crew, adding its quality score to the roll. Out of these 5 checks, 3 or more must be successful to qualify as a success. If all 5 are successful, that qualifies as a total success. If all 5 are failures, that qualifies as a total failure. If no one makes a check for a particular of- ficer, one failure is contributed to the group check. Consult the Whirlpool Check Results table (adapted from Ghosts of Saltmarsh). Further, if the PCs’ ship is within 15 feet of the ship stolen by Loyb, a rescue can be at- tempted, either by throwing a ladder down or by other means. Again, the DCs are 10. If a ladder is thrown, this requires a character (not an officer currently occupied with the group check) to make a Strength (Athletics) check. Each subsequent round, if the ships move farther than 25 feet apart, this check will need to be made again. While the ladder is con- nected, Loyb will climb up it, followed by each of the women, at their movement speeds. WHIRLPOOL CHECK RESULTS Result Effect Total Success The vessel uses the whirlpool to its advantage and increases its speed by 20 ft. during its current turn. Success The vessel can move normally on its turn. Failure The vessel is immediately moved 15 ft. toward the vortex’s center, and the vessel is restrained by the whirlpool until the start of its next turn. Total Failure As a failure. Additionally, if the vessel is in the whirlpool at the start of its next turn, all checks the vessel makes to determine the whirlpool’s effects are made with disadvantage on that turn. When the party decides to leave the whirlpool, with or without Loyb and his party, another group check will be required. If any creature or vessel reaches the center of the vortex, it is pulled 15 feet under the sur- face. No group checks are available at this point. Each individual creature will have the chance to make a Strength (Athletics) check on their turn to swim according to their move- ment toward the surface. Each failure means they are dragged 15 feet lower. Once a creature or ship reaches 25 feet of depth, they are dragged by the current. Should this occur for both the PCs and Loyb, skip ahead to Act III, with the party washed up on shore (page 9). If Loyb and his women are rescued, he intro- duces himself as Leo Fernhand, a merchant who is delivering these women to their ex- pectant husbands far east of here. “You wouldn’t have heard o’ the place,” he tells the party. A DC 10 Wisdom (Intuition) check re- veals that he is lying, and this check can be made at advantage if any character has seen a wanted poster for Henenu Ferghus Loyb. Even 6 SEA TRAVELING on a failed check, a character believes him but thinks that Fernhand bears a striking resem- blance to Loyb. Give the following descriptions of Loyb and his companions: Tlanextli Ssimalli, introduced as Lainey, is, in her natural state, a red-brown skinned, black- haired woman with yellow snake eyes and black-and-red scales covering her face. When she transforms into a snake, she has a sleek body with mottled black and red scales. She has a pale forked tongue. When the party en- counters her in disguise, she appears according to the following description: Izel Eztli, introduced as Hazel, is naturally a dark-tanned yuan-ti with red eyes, dark brown hair, and prominent fangs before a pale forked tongue like Tlanextli’s. In snake form she bears brown and black stripes across her body with a broad and rounded head. But in her disguise, she looks like this: Itotia Eztli is Izel’s sister, introduced as Alice. In her natural form she has red-brown skin, brown eyes, blonde hair, and yellow scales mottled with blue covering her torso. As a snake she is stocky, with the same blue-speck- led yellow scales and a blue tongue. In her dis- guise, she appears as follows: When they encounter the PCs, each of the women has just imbibed a dose of the Sune po- tion (see the Appendix), disguising their true natures and bewitching those around them. The women have nothing except their cloth- ing. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check shows that Loyb is carrying 50 gold pieces, a box with 12 doses of Sune potion (and 3 empty slots), a rolled-up white flag, and a rolled-up pirate flag, all stashed in various pockets and folds. He might also have the flag of one or more nations that are involved in your cam- paign. He’ll object to any search, claiming he has only his personal possessions. Henenu Ferghus Loyb The satyr stands about 4 and a half feet tall, with a round, bare belly covered in the same ruddy brown hair that makes up his curled mustache and pointed goatee. His head is bald, but a curled-back yellowish horn adorns each side of his forehead. A dingy red leather jacket is open over his chest, and a belt with a few pouches, a shortsword, and a shortbow with quiver is strapped around his waist. Tlanextli Ssimalli A tall, thin, glossy-black haired woman, her dark eyes are flecked with gold. Her cheekbones are high and severe. A thin sleeveless red shift covers very little of her sleek, sun-struck brown skin. Izel Eztli Dark brown hair curls around the round, dark brown skin of this woman with a thin-strapped green dress hanging from her shoulders. She stands just under 5-and-a-half feet tall, but her deep brown eyes are pools of inviting liquid chocolate. Itotia Eztli The muscular blonde woman is just under 6 feet tall, with impenetrable brown eyes and a blue form-fitting dress with small off-the-shoulder sleeves. Her skin is dark reddish brown. LOYB’S CON Loyb is a basic con-man. All his motives are about profit. But he has been found out by too many former marks. Hence the wanted posters. His current con involves these women, as de- scribed in the Adventure Summary. While he doesn’t know much of their background, he is aware of their true identities. The potion he has to disguise them was a recent purchase from an alchemist in a port city a few months ago. He feels relatively sure he could go back and pur- chase more, but his current stash is meant to al- low for at least two identical cons. The longer he spends with the PCs, the more of his resources he wastes. So he will grow more impatient the more time goes on. So he is keen to keep the women secreted away. He will insist that they be given private quarters (with him, if possible), where they can be out of sight when their potions start wearing off. He also will urge them to seduce any crew- members for various advantages and transport. THE TRAVELING SALESMAN 7 ACT II—MEN WILL ALWAYS BE MEN Loyb will maintain his disguise as Leo Fern- hand until found out. And he will also accuse the captain of the ship of causing his wreck. In all likelihood, the party will want to lock Loyb away for the return journey. But the women will appear harmless, and further to have no real allegiance to Loyb. They express their desire for husbands, as though the travel- ing salesman was their ticket to a better life. They admit that they come from a very poor place with little opportunity. But Loyb appears now to be a total failure in their eyes. There should be no hint that they are lying or deceiv- ing the party. Whether the party locks the women away or not, they will try to warm up to the crew as much as possible. They do not want to be brought into a highly-populated area, and at all costs, they do not want to be incarcerated. TWO POSSIBLE SCHEMES Loyb and the women realize that there’s every chance of things going poorly for them if they stay on this ship as they are. They will try to reach a nearby island, and to make a big score among the wealthy dwarvish miners. The navigator will know of the island known as Harrvot, and that it is a settlement popu- lated by wealthy dwarvish miners. Any char- acter who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (History) check will recall that this is a mithral mine, but with a capable group of craftsmen who certainly would be able to repair a ship, among other things. It is not far, only a journey of a day and a half. Whatever damage the ship has taken, it certainly can stay afloat until it reaches the island. To accomplish this, here are two possible schemes, both using the charm and charisma of the women affected by the Sune potion. HELPLESS DAMSELS If they are free to roam the ship, or if they have contact with crewmembers who bring them food, etc., the women will try to influence the crew to help them escape to a better life on Harrvot. They will even throw Loyb under the bus, calling him a beast and a thug, describing him as disgusting and horrible. They won’t ex- plicitly claim he is abusive (which he isn’t), but they might imply it. This is a pure play on the heartstrings and sympathies of the party and crew. They will avoid using the charm person fea- ture of the Sune potion, because it only lasts for one hour and their target would realize they’d been manipulated after it wore off. But in the most extreme case, they might make use of their suggestion ability to influence the captain or another officer to take the ship to the island. If any member of the crew has means for long- distance communication (e.g. sending, animal messenger), the women might try to influence that character to send a message to the island of Harrvot, asking them to send help, even us- ing suggestion. Their ultimate hope is that the ship will will- ingly go to Harrvot, but if necessary they may move on to “sabotage”: SABOTAGE If the women are free to roam the ship (and perhaps if the “helpless damsels” route has failed), they will sabotage it in private, or if they are held captive, send someone of the crew to do so on their behalf, especially by bor- ing holes in the hull, causing it to take on wa- ter. If the party doesn’t realize the location of Harrvot immediately, Loyb might suggest it. Despite his slimy demeanor, the party might see that there is still a good help to find here. The women might still use suggestion, as a next-to-last resort. If all else fails, the women and Loyb will resort to assassination, but they will endeavor to avoid overt violence. Of course, the ship might already have taken damage from the whirlpool encounter in Act I. this would provide an intrinsic desire to find a port for repairs. If the party doesn’t take the bait, or if they foil Loyb’s plans, the group will still try to take control of the ship and the party, until they are 8 SEA TRAVELING handed off to some sort of law enforcement. At any point, therefore, you can skip the follow- ing acts and move on to the Resolution, which will certainly have some implications for fu- ture adventures with your party. ACT III—NOT A CHEAT, A MIRACLE As the ship nears Harrvot, read the following: The boat is manned by three male dwarf veter- ans, wearing mithral armor. They are Sullvar Greystone, a brown-haired and -bearded dwarf with some flecks of grey; Targi Flamestall, a younger dwarf with black hair and beard; and Gerthen Gembeard, Harrvot’s mining supervi- sor, who does indeed have half a dozen pre- cious gems decorating his deep brown beard. If Loyb and the women have managed to get a message to the Harrvotian miners, then that becomes the subject of their discussion. They hear that there are beautiful women aboard who need homes, and the dwarves are happy to provide them ones on Harrvot. Otherwise, the dwarves will ask what busi- ness the party has with them. They are wary of unannounced visitors, given the value of their mines. But they can be persuaded to let the ship dock and be repaired. At first, the dwarves might make a reasona- ble request for payment for the repairs—1 day per hit point of repair, and 20 gp for materials and labor. However, the moment any contact is made with the women, the dwarves will de- mand them as payment, in addition to half the other costs. They also demand that Loyb be re- leased, and any charges held against him by the party be dropped. Even if repairs are not necessary, the dwa- rves will demand these women, before letting the party leave. If the party assents to this trade, you have a few options: repairs might continue with no immediate fallout. If the party leaves, however, allowing Loyb and the women to carry out their plot on Harrvot, that mining operation will quickly halt as many of the miners are de- voured and killed by the yuan-ti. It could even become an outpost of yuan-ti cultists. Of course, this could be the outcome of any “fail- ure” on the part of the PCs. Another option would be to utilize this as a temporary peaceful conclusion. If it appears impossible for the party to succeed in combat (especially with a derelict ship), the party will have little choice. But if they can agree, even in part, the party will be given lodging and rest while their repairs are being accomplished. They might be able to negotiate a way to keep Loyb in their custody, but will be required to separate from the women. Any outright confrontation with the dwarves will call more warriors—dwarf guards—in to A thin ring of green surrounds the base of a squat grey mountain. In all, the island is per- haps one square mile. A few thin lines of smoke rise from various spots around the mount, cer- tainly the location of different mining opera- tions. Out from the island comes a longboat, crewed by three dwarves. As they near you, they are signaling for you to halt and parley. THE TRAVELING SALESMAN 9 combat. Add as many as you think necessary, to make the encounter difficult, but not neces- sarily deadly. The goal of the three dwarf vet- erans will be to get the women and perhaps Loyb away from the party and to retreat into the mines, in which case, the adventure contin- ues in the dungeon of Act IV. If the party can enter the mines after them in this way, a party of 1d4+1 dwarf guards will come after them each 1d10 minutes. Should this delay the party in pursuit for enough time, the cave-in of Act IV will occur. WHIRLPOOL SHIPWRECK If the party has shipwrecked on the island as a result of the whirlpool from Act I, read the fol- lowing: The party will quickly encounter the Harrvo- tian dwarves, either by following the four fig- ures—Loyb and the women—or by exploring the island. The miners will want to know who they are, showing the same sort of wariness of outsiders. But realizing they need help, the same offers and negotiations will be made as above. HARRVOT The island of Harrvot itself is not large. There are a few huts, living areas and mining out- posts all around the mountain at the island’s center, but the main dwarvish settlement is on the southeast side of the mountain, spreading toward the south and toward the east, made up of buildings with stone foundations that match the stones of the mountain, but with walls and roofs made out of the trees native to the island. The main port is bounded by two tall stone towers manned by lookouts and archers—again, their product is valuable, and these dwarves are ready to defend it. The settlement is governed almost in a milita- ristic style by a governor: Varthen Greystone (Sullvar’s father), a scarred and grey-bearded dwarf who presents himself in full plate armor, complete with a smooth helmet with a green plume. There are a few other humanoids (mostly humans) besides the dwarves, but in all the population is just under 1,000. One tav- ern exists—the Tank—a broad, square building with the same stone foundation and a wrapa- round porch with thin stone columns holding up the thatched roof. By and large the settlers share a common ideal in their mining operation, because the whole colony prospers from it. But some would like to see a few of the immigration re- strictions lifted. Greystone and his militia watches every visitor closely, keeping a strict two-day limit on their stay. No one is allowed to settle without a hugely compelling reason. One exception is if someone from the colony brings back a spouse or children from outside. Such marriages are just common enough not to raise suspicion among the locals. However, of note is the fact that Varthen Greystone has intended his son Sullvar to marry a dwarf woman, and objects to the match with any of Loyb’s women. ACT IV—IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT? The dwarves, if fleeing, will try to hide the women in the mines. If a temporary peace is brokered instead, the women will try to get their prospective dwarf husbands to marry them immediately and then take them into the mine. Their plan is to kill them privately and blame it on a cave-in. They know their time is short with the potions, and hope to move quickly. The use of suggestion will come in handy for them here. If the party has been removed from contact with Loyb and the women, Varthen Greystone will meet with them and communicate at vari- ous times. It should be made clear during these You wake on a rocky shore with a deep green treeline close by. In the sea behind you, resting at an odd angle, is your ship, severely damaged, run aground. A few of your possessions are floating around you, and your companions are close by. About a fifty yards up the beach from you is the wreckage of the ship you followed into the whirlpool, and you can see four human- oid figures running into the forest. 10 SEA TRAVELING meetings that he has no objection to the other dwarves taking some of Loyb’s women as wives, but is at odds with his son over the is- sue. At some point, there is a commotion outside as many dwarves are running from the mine with a cloud of dust billowing out from it. One of them tells Greystone that the three dwarves and their new wives have gone alone into the mines, and one of the passages collapsed after them. Darmi Sendarmen, the cleric of Ulaa (see area 8 below) might be seen among them, say- ing that the three couples purchased marriage licenses from him not long before going into the mine. Greystone, concerned especially for his son, for whom he had intended a different wife, petitions the party to go after them, with the aid of 4 dwarf guards, to bring them back safely. Other dwarf miners will be on hand to remove some of the rubble, but will not inter- act unless it is obvious that they are needed. If bargained with, Greystone may offer any- thing from a set of mithral chainmail to defiant sails as a reward for recovering the dwarves (especially his son). Loyb, as a note, will not want to go into the mines. If no one thinks to check on him, he is totally absent. If anyone approaches him before entering the mines, he will try to weasel out, insisting that he has every confidence in the abilities of the adventurers. A DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check shows that he knows something and wants to have plausible deniability. THE HARRVOT MINES To the right of the mine entrance and about 50 feet high on the mountainside is a pulley and winch, with several wooden pallets. Any of these can be used with a DC 10 Strength (Ath- letics) check, to lift or lower up to 500 pounds. Large pieces of mining equipment are loaded on this and hefted high onto the mountain. On top there is a plateau near a set of double wooden doors, as described after the wide staircase in area 1. Inside, grey slate stone characterizes the walls, ceilings, and floors of the mine. Ceilings are 10 feet high unless otherwise noted, and there is an unlit torch in a sconce on the wall every 30 feet. The corridors are therefore com- pletely dark. Occasional wooden support beams are found especially in the deeper parts of the mine, but more permanent supports are made of stone. Sound echoes along the stone, and the tem- perature is cool, about 50°F. The locations are identified on the map on page 12. THE TIMELINE The women’s plot, of course, is to kill their new husbands in the midst of the cave-in. Time is of the essence, whether the party realizes it or not. You can decide for yourself whether the dwarves are still alive when the party arrives or not, but here are some tips to make the deci- sion easier: If the party makes the most direct route pos- sible to area 14, the dwarves will still be alive. What constitutes “the most direct route possi- ble” is open to debate, as there are several op- tions. But you can use your best judgment. If the party spends more than a few cursory moments in areas 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 13, these are the prime time-wasting areas, and the dwarves will likely be dead. If the party ever leaves the mine after enter- ing, the dwarves are certainly dead. There are several interesting spectacles the party might see when they finally encounter Loyb’s women and the dwarves. Several op- tions are detailed under area 14, but you can embellish more as you like. Further, however, if the party enters the mines besides in response to a cave-in, there is a 50 percent chance of 1d4 dwarf guards in any given area. Of course, they will be working as appropriate to the area, cooking in area 6 or forging in area 12, etc. THE TRAVELING SALESMAN 11 1. ENTRANCE The entrance to the mine is a semicircle 15 feet high, descending quickly and immediately so that the darkness covers the interior of the mine already here. As the adventurers enter the mine, read the following: The staircase, which is laced with mithral, leads down to area 9. The ropes in the bridge are also laced with mithral, and so is holding up very strongly. Some of the wooden planks have been recently replaced, but others are worn and cracked. If the party tries to track Loyb’s women in- side, it is very difficult among the various other tracks. A DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check shows that most tracks cover the spiral stair- case, with a few back and forth across the bridge and to the door on the opposite side. Across the bridge, the following details can be given: The door leads into area 2, and is unlocked. The staircase goes up to a landing, then up another flight to a set of double wooden doors out into open air. Here rests the pulley and winch with pallets that can be lowered to the ground below. From this vantage on the mountainside, a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check shows a narrow path with steps that leads to another open-air section of the mountain more than 100 feet far- ther from the edge. A column of smoke is visi- ble from there even if the Perception check fails. This is the vent from the chimney—area 7. The window above area 8 is invisible until characters are closer to it. If they follow the path to the chimney, they might spot the win- dow along the way. 2. GERTHEN GEMBEARD’S OFFICE This large room serves as the headquarters for the mining operation. Gembeard spends most of his time here, but he might be employed to negotiate a trade agreement for the colony’s mithral. The papers on the desk are inventory and workforce records and other mundane things. There are no drawers in the desk. The staircase leads down to area 10. The western door is open and leads to area 3, but a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check shows a deadbolt lock that has been left open. The southern iron gate is locked and leads to area 4, which is partially visible from this area—a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check shows racks of shovels, picks, and other mining equipment in that area, and that there are more entrances to that room. Treasure. The lodestone on the desk is mostly mithral and is worth 100 gp. The chest contains a set of common clothes, 10 gp, and 5 chryso- prase stones each worth 50 gp. The goblets on the cupboard would each fetch 5 gp, and the crystal bottle and its liquid (wine) are worth 10 gp total. A stone staircase descends about 10 feet into the mine and shrouding darkness. A 5-foot-wide passageway leads 20 feet ahead, and on the right is a 5-foot-wide chasm that vanishes 50 feet down. A metallic spiral staircase descends the eastern side. Across the western side stretches a wood-and-rope bridge. On the western side of the long corridor is a wooden door. About 20 feet further, the corridor turns sharply to the right. After another 20 feet there is a wide staircase heading upwards. The circular room is dusty, but organized. An oil lantern rests unlit on a desk in the center of the room, next to a stack of papers held down by a small lodestone. A chest sits open on the floor next to the desk, opposite a simple wooden stool. A cupboard on the southwestern wall con- tains several iron goblets and a crystal bottle of deep red liquid. There is a wooden door on the eastern wall, another on the western wall, and a gate of iron bars on the southern wall. At the northeast corner is a staircase leading down. 12 SEA TRAVELING THE HARRVOT MINE, GROUND LEVEL THE HARRVOT MINE, LOWER LEVEL THE TRAVELING SALESMAN 13 3.

TOOL AND EQUIPMENT STORAGE This room serves as a storage area for the min- ers to leave their tools while eating in area 5 or worshiping in area 8. There are plenty of empty spaces for tools on the racks, but there is little else of interest in the room. Treasure. The mining equipment could be sold for a total of 5 gp. 5. DINING HALL This is really a multipurpose room. The miners will have meals here, but it also serves as a sort of narthex into the chapel in area 8. The eastern door leads to area 4, and the south- ern door opens into a short corridor that comes to a T, leading towards areas 6, 7, and 8. Besides various food crumbs, there is not much of interest in this chamber. The dishes have all been removed. If anyone nears the northwest corner, however, two swarms of rats will fight their way out to area 6. 6. KITCHEN Heat from the stoves is vented through small chimneys in the wall. The dishes are simple, ef- fectively worthless, and the meat could be sold for 2 gp. If there are no dwarves in this cham- ber, a swarm of rats is investigating the meat. 7. CHIMNEY This 7-foot-wide column extends from the floor beyond area 12 all the way up to the open air on the mountainside, as described near the end of area 1. Coal fills the bottom, the area adja- cent to area 12, but beyond that, adventurers may be given the following details: Whenever a creature begins its turn inside the chimney, that creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 fire damage and gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures take half as much damage on a suc- cessful save and do not gain the level of ex- haustion. Each round a creature spends inside the chimney the DC increases by 2. Creatures immune to fire damage are immune to these effects. A small bed rests against the western wall, its sheets rumpled. A small table sits in the north- east corner with an empty pitcher and bowl. An unlit torch and a small book rests on a shelf dug out of the wall on the western wall near the head of the bed. Five racks line the center of this 30-foot-by-30- foot room, with a dozen shovels, picks, and other tools mounted on them. A corridor leads off to the east, with a handful of thick stone col- umns holding up the ceiling, and from that cor- ridor a wide and steep staircase leads down. A wooden door is against the western wall. A gate of iron bars is on the northern wall. A pair of 40-foot stone tables rest parallel on the floor of this massive room, a long wooden bench on either side of each. The ceiling rises 20 feet high, with an iron chandelier, unlit, hanging from the center. There is one wooden door on the south wall, and another on the east side. This kitchen is well-stocked, with two stoves on the eastern wall, and five barrels of water on the south wall. Near the door, in the southwest cor- ner, there is a hook with a large slab of meat hanging from the ceiling. The north wall is cov- ered floor-to-ceiling with cupboards of dishes and silverware. Hot smoke fills this chimney, rising swiftly out to the open air above. An iron ladder leads along its entire length on the southern wall, from the red heat at the bottom to the opening above, in all about 100 feet. 14 SEA TRAVELING All these effects are doubled on the floor of the chimney, on the coals themselves. (The DC remains the same.) 8. CHAPEL TO ULAA The mining colony of Harrvot does its due dili- gence to the goddess of mining. This chapel is the only explicitly religious location on the is- land, but individual colonists might have pri- vate altars or shrines. The chapel itself is tended by the cleric Darmi Sendarmen, who lives in the mine and sleeps on a private cot be- hind the curtain on the northern end of the chapel. If the party ventures beyond the curtain, the following description can be provided: The book is The World Anvil by Balifra Ever- sharp, a religious text in dwarvish. If anyone 1 Mike Mearls and Jeremy Crawford, Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes, edited by Kim Mohan, Michele Carter (Ren- ton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, 2018), 67. pages through the text, a few lines are under- lined or circled, including the following: “Every fall of the hammer on the anvil, every fire stoked in the forge, is a step on a journey set before me by Moradin himself. It isn’t work. It is a challenge to achieve greatness.”1 And: “We live in the stones, we work in the stones, we die in the stones, we will rest forever in the stones we have molded.” The book is worth 8 gp to the right buyer. The documents in the wall cutout are various official records of religious import: funeral doc- uments, marriage licenses, and birth certifi- cates. All of these are blank forms. The stack appears to be deliberate and organized, besides the various sheets that have fallen to the ground. Most of those that have fallen are mar- riage licenses. The window is noted at the end of the de- scription of area 1. It can be opened quite easily if anyone is next to it. But there are no supports all the way down. Anyone falling from the height will take 5d6 bludgeoning damage. If the party enters this chapel before the cave- in, disregard the scattered pages in the private curtained-off room of Darmi Sendarmen. In- stead, Sendarmen is tending to the altar, scrub- bing it clean. The dwarves and the women may have already come through and purchased the marriage licenses from him, depending on when the party enters this room. 9. LOWER LANDING After the cave-in, everywhere on the lower level is coated in a thin layer of dust, and a fine cloud of dust floats in the air. Along the vari- ous corridors, there are numerous dead-ends This chapel is constructed in the shape of a mas- sive semi-sphere. At its apex, the ceiling curves up 50 feet high, where a window allows in a shaft of light. It’s 50 feet wide. The walls and floors are smooth, almost reflective stone. Intri- cate designs are carved and etched along the walls, giving the impression of columns. Six true columns, thick and designed with the bearded faces of wizened dwarves, stand in the chamber on either side. Rows of seats line the east and west side of the chamber, with an aisle down the center leading towards the stone altar near the front. A trough surrounds the base of the altar, and faint dark stains are visible on both the altar and trough. The side of the altar shows the etched design of a miner’s pick. Beyond the altar, on the north end of the chapel, a thick red curtain cordons off a small section, invisible to the rest of the room. The curtain has created a small room, barely more than 10 by 5 feet, containing a simple cot and washbasin. A single book rests on the floor next to the cot. In a cutout shelf in the wall, vari- ous documents are stacked. Some have fallen onto the floor. THE TRAVELING SALESMAN 15 and unfinished tunnels. The occasional wooden support beams are more frequent on this level. The spiral staircase is the same as that in area 1. The wide staircase on the southern end con- nects to area 4. The doorway to the north leads into area 10 and is locked. 10. MINE SUPERVISOR’S STAIRCASE This area is the “back entrance” that can be used by Gerthen Gembeard, connecting di- rectly with his office. The staircase leads up to area 2. 11. CISTERN This is a cistern that provides drinking water to the miners. There is really no limit to the depth of the pool, because it actually connects to a natural freshwater spring under the mountain. The opening that connects to the spring is ap- proximately 20 feet down, and only about 2 feet wide. 12. FORGE Before the cave-in, Bimel Strongfist is con- stantly hard at work here, repairing tools or building some of the finer products of mithral for sale. There are other forges and smithies around the island, but Strongfist gets the honor of first choice. The chimney is area 7, at the bottom level. While Strongfist is absent, if anyone touches anything of the forged mithral items or the hid- den stone case near the anvil (see “Treasure” in this room), the weapons and armor on the walls are animated and attack the invaders: a suit of animated armor, two flying swords, and four flying warhammers. For the flying warhammers, use the stat block for flying swords, except that the “Longsword” attack is replaced by the following: Warhammer. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d10+1) bludg- eoning damage. Further, while Strongfist is absent, the door on the north wall is locked. Treasure. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a cache of refined mithral worth 100 gp in a stone case hidden in the floor near the anvil. The weapons and armor are likewise all made of mithral, fetching 700 gp per piece. 13. CAVE-IN The cave-in is very difficult to pass. A Strength (Athletics) check of 15 or higher is required to move even a single large stone, and it will re- quire 2d12+10 successful checks to make it through. Stones can be broken apart with a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check and then moved without requiring a check. Approximately 5 feet of stone will need to be passed through to get to the passageway on the other side. This A 15-foot-wide corridor stretches 40 feet north and south, with a slight curve to the southeast. An iron spiral staircase ascends 50 feet upward. Around the corner to the south of this is a wide and steep staircase heading up. On the north end is a wooden doorway. To the west, the cor- ridor goes further until it comes to a T and turns to the south and to the north. This small room features only one narrow stair- case in the southwest corner. A small lip or curb crosses the entrance to this room. The floor is completely covered in water, whose depth is imperceptible in the darkness. Hanging on the wall to the west, within arm’s reach of the entrance, is a ladle. The heat in this room is a stark contrast to the rest of the mine. It’s at least 20 or 30 degrees hot- ter in here than anywhere else, owing to the hot coal fire from the chimney beyond the iron gate to the south. A wooden door bars the northern wall. An anvil stands prominently near the fire, and numerous forging and smithing tools line the walls, as well as half a dozen weapons and a suit of plate mail. The cavern ahead is completely blocked by fallen rubble. The ceiling above has crumbled. In places it still looks fragile. The splinters of a few wooden support beams lay crushed among the stones. 16 SEA TRAVELING requires a total of 100 damage being dealt to the stone. However, once 50 damage or more has been dealt, all characters within 10 feet of the last hit must make a DC 15 Dexterity sav- ing throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage as more stone caves in from the ceiling. The same occurs if half of the necessary Strength (Athlet- ics) checks are made to move the stones. After a cave-in like this, the work required to get through starts over with 150% of the original required checks. After 2 such cave-ins, this re- set will not occur again. If the party approaches this area before the cave-in, disregard this section. The corridor simply leads into area 14. 14. MITHRAL LODE The balcony is area 15. If this chamber is en- tered before the cave-in, more than a dozen dwarves are at work. When the characters en- ter after the cave-in, depending on how many of the couples made it this far and whether or not the dwarves are still alive, the party might see the dwarves each in the center of the room, stupefied and in the embrace of the beautiful women. Or they might be in the coils of the gi- ant snake forms (the Large constrictor snake form) of the women (these forms are described on page 6). Due to the nature of this con, the women will not try to devour the dwarves, but instead to leave the impression that they were crushed in the cave-in. If the party arrives late enough, the dwarves might actually be buried under rubble near the entrance to the east of this chamber, with the women crouched and pretending to mourn them. If more than an hour has passed, the sune potion has worn off, and the women will be in their yuan-ti forms. They will hide their appearances under large, dirty cloaks or blankets taken from the dwarves, and disguise their complexions with mud and dust from the mines. A DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to see through the makeshift disguise. Should combat ensue with the women, they might fight in snake form. Consider making use of the “Unusual Abilities” found in Volo’s Guide to Monsters, p. 98, such as shed skin, and bite. Otherwise, not having weapons of their own, they might steal some from their hus- bands (the weapons of veterans: longsword, shortsword, and/or heavy crossbow), or they might make use of a mining pick or shovel (use the statistics for a war pick or club). Having been discovered, the women will desperately want to kill the adventurers, leaving no wit- nesses, so that they can escape. If they feel they cannot win, they will try to get to Loyb to take the potions and sway the dwarves to their side, ideally before they’re spotted. Otherwise, they will try to flee the island entirely, stealing a ship to do so if necessary. 15. BALCONY It’s a 30-foot drop to the floor below, and the ceiling rises 20 feet above. The winch and pul- ley can be used with a DC 10 Strength (Athlet- ics) check to lift or lower up to 500 pounds. RESOLUTION Depending on the damage done by Loyb’s women, the dwarves of Harrvot might wish to prosecute Loyb in their own fashion. Of course, there are still many outstanding bounties for him, so some diplomacy might be attempted by the party for his extradition. In this massive chamber, almost 50 by 60 feet, and 50 feet high, mithral is being extracted from the rough walls. Baskets full of lodestones rest in the corners, and large piles of stones are scat- tered about. A few torches are lit on the western wall, where various mining tools are laid about. A wooden table on that wall holds a few lode- stones and a loupe for examining the stones. To the south, a passageway is visible 30 feet high, coming out in the form of a balcony. A pulley and winch lead a rope connected to a wooden The corridor comes to an abrupt end at a ledge over a huge chamber. A winch and pulley in the ceiling holds a rope connected to a wooden pal- let which rests just on the ledge. THE TRAVELING SALESMAN 17 Greystone makes good on his offer of reward if his son is brought back safely. The reward will be much smaller if any of the dwarves are killed as a result of the women’s treachery. If sincere effort is made by the party, Greystone is at least grateful enough to provide repairs to the ship for free, and at least a discount on some mithral materials. If any of the women survive and are interro- gated, a successful Charisma (Persuasion or In- timidation) check can get them to reveal that they are members of a yuan-ti cult on an island in the sea, seeking to gain wealth for the pur- poses of strengthening the tribe. Eventually, they hope to build strong enough to regain their former glory. They will die before reveal- ing the location of the island, however, speaking only of their pride in the glory of a being called “Vra’al.” Loyb will protest his arrest, and even try to claim that he was helpful in capturing the women, who deceived him just as much as they deceived everyone else. He might at this point try to bargain for his freedom with the Sune potion, assuming it hasn’t already been confiscated. He may of course have already shown it to the party or the dwarves (under duress) when the women took the dwarves deep into the mine and the cave-in occurred. But he can be dropped off at any large port city you choose, for a reward amounting to up to 10,000 gp. If he is dead, the reward is only up to 1,000 gp. 18 SEA TRAVELING APPENDIX: MAGIC ITEMS DEFIANT SAILS Ship upgrade (movement), very rare (Taken from Ghosts of Saltmarsh, p. 197) These sails glitter with a fine coat of mithral treated with abjuration magic. While the sails are unfurled, ranged weapon attacks made against the ship and anyone aboard it are made with disadvantage, as a result of the sails’ pro- tective magic. This drawback doesn’t apply if the attacker is aboard the ship. MITHRAL ARMOR Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t. MITHRAL WEAPONS Weapon (any non-Heavy), uncommon A weapon made from mithral weighs half as much as if it were made from other metals. Mithral is too light to be used for Heavy weap- ons. If the weapon isn’t Heavy, it becomes Light. If it is already Light, it gains the Finesse property. If the weapon is Two-Handed it is now instead Versatile. SUNE POTION Potion, very rare When you drink this potion, a number of ef- fects take place, centered on you, for a duration of 1 hour. The spell save DC for each effect is 15. Its effects initially are as though you cast the disguise self spell on yourself, only with the limitation that you appear to be a more attrac- tive version of yourself. Additionally, the effects of a calm emotions spell are centered on you. While the duration of this effect is also 1 hour, the save can be made again each minute. As an action, you can cast the charm person spell on a humanoid you can see within range. You can cast this spell 3 times during the dura- tion of the potion. Alternative names: “Sune potion” is named after the Forgotten Realms goddess. If your campaign doesn’t take place in the Forgotten Realms or use these deities, any divinity of fertility, love, or nature could suit, even Venus or Aphrodite. Alternatively, you can simply call it the “bewitching potion.”","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
