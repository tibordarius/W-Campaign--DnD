You were all captured recently, tried for your crimes, and have been sentenced to be executed the following morning. All of your gear has been taken from you and you find yourself in a lonely and grim prison cell. Only the pale moonlight and sounds of crashing waves from the solitary window high up on the prison wall serves as any comfort. You hear one voice coughing in the corner, the old pirate Billy Bones, \"Well ye scallywags, I reckon I won't make it ta mornin' with me injuries. Looks like I'll be cheatin' the hangman after all! \"Hear me, I was first mate ta Captain Flint, the most dreaded pirate ta ever sail these here waters. Our ship was attacked by tha Royal Navy and I was the last survivor. But I happen ta know where his vast treasure hoard be buried. Treasure Island it be called. Here be me map. If ye make yer way outa this prison cell 'fore dawn, then seek out the treasure. A king's life awaits ye!\" The old pirate dies after handing you a torn and tattered map, leaving you to figure out how you're going to get out of this prison and to the fabled island of treasure. You find yourselves dreaming about swimming in piles of gold and what you would do if such a treasure was yours. A. Prison Cell The adventurers find themselves locked up in a small 30ftx30ft prison cell, bereft of any of their equipment. The room is dimly lit from the moonlight outside. All of their gear is stashed away in a chest on the other side of the prison door made of iron bars which is locked (DC15 to pick the lock or DC19 Strength check to dislodge the door from its rusty hinges). A DC18 Investigation check reveals a secret tunnel hidden beneath one of the floor stones that leads to the sewer just outside the prison door. During the test session One of the adventurers merely cast Thunderwave on the prison walls, blasting them outwards and avoided the entire prison interior! Then they remembered that all of their gear was still back in the prison, so they broke into the place to retrieve their stuff. If the prisoners are not making any progress with their escape attempt, then not to worry. The town comes under attack from another pirate vessel that starts firing cannon shots at the prison. One of these wild cannonballs smashes through the prison wall as well as the door, leaving a clear path to their belongings as well as the way out. B. Docks The window in the prison cell faces the docks. If the adventurers head in this direction, they will come across three ships currently anchored there. The Conquerer, which is a magnificent military sailboat. It is currently patrolled by 5 Guards. There are very few supplies onboard as the vessel just recently came back from an epic sea-battle (which involved the capture of the adventurers).

Treasure IslandFinding the fabled island is made possible with the treasuremap (refer last page of this document), but a successfullanding requires a Survival check.RollResult>20You find a suitable natural port in the SE corner ofthe island<20You find a reasonable anchoring point in the north ofthe island<10You are unable to decide where to dock, so youweigh anchor at some random point and take thelongboat to the nearest shoreRead or paraphrase this to your playersAfter several days of journey on the ship, land comes to sight.A gorgeous tropical island with sparkling blue water, beachesof gold-like sand and lush forests. Tall mountains rise in theheart of the island, capped with snow. From your vantagepoint in the ship, it seems like an untouched paradise, amasterpiece from a classical painter's repertoire.The serene blue waves crash gently on the beaches, as gullsand other sea birds enjoy the midday sun.It almost seems like a perfect place to live, if it wasn'tlocated in the middle of nowhere and didn't have anydangerous creatures like the map indicates.D0. Skeletal MarkersThe island is dotted with skeletal markers left behind byCaptain Flint, nailed to various trees with one armoutstretched in the direction of the treasure. There can be asmany or as few as required, and serve to get the adventurers agentle nudge to proceed in a specific direction.A successful DC17 Survival check implies that theadventurers find a skeletal marker and proceed to the nextarea without any issue.Upon failure, they stumbleinto one of thefollowingencounters.At the end of each encounter, they find the next skeletalmarker automatically.These skeletons are all the poor remnants of CaptainFlint's crew who helped him carry and bury the treasure. Hekilled all of them to ensure that the secret of the treasureremained only with him and those close to him.D1. Village of LizardfolkOn the South-East portion of the island, a group of lizardfolkhave established their village. At any time, there will be atleast 4 Lizardfolk in this area, busy with drying fish,repairing broken nets, cleaning their fishing implements ortaking care of their children.The lizardfolk are generally disinterested in theadventurers, having gotten used to the pirates passing by.They speak in broken common and are open to giving theadventurers any food or advice regarding the island inexchange for armor or weapons. They are not interested ingold or treasure, having no value for this in their isolatedenvironment.One of the Lizardfolk by the name of Grunt is willing toaccompany the party after offering any powerfulweapons/armor and a successful DC18 Persuasion check.D2. Triceratops NestThis is an encounter that can play out at any stage during thetrek through the forest. The adventurers encounter a largeTriceratops lumbering through a forest clearing, protectingits nest of 3 eggs. Intelligent adventurers (DC 12 Intelligenceor Nature Check) can deduce that this is a very rare creatureand that its eggs could fetch a fortune.The triceratops has poor eyesight but has very sharphearing. Adventurers must succeed a DC15 stealth check toapproach the nest unobserved. However, if they create asound distraction to draw the creature away from the nest,they can make this check at advantage.A triceratops egg is two feet in size andweighs 20 pounds.5TREASURE ISLAND D3 . The Maze Somewhere along the trek through the forest, this encounter can be triggered. The adventurers inadvertantly step into a Maze spell and find themselves looping back to the same section of the forest over and over. Any object thrown in one direction comes flying back at them from the opposite direction. Walking backwards or closing one's eyes makes no difference as it only loops back to the opposite side again. A successful DC18 Intelligence Check is required to recognize the nature of the magic and lead the group out of the endless maze. D4 . The Log Cabin Further down the trail of the treasure, the adventurers chance upon a log cabin, made of tree trunks, branches and leaves, constructed within the past year. The lone occupant of this cabin is Ben Gunn (Thug) who escaped the wrath of Captain Flint 2 years ago and has been stranded on the island ever since. He has been surviving using only his wits and his friendship with the local Lizardfolk tribe. He alone knows the secret to accessing the treasure and has actually been moving parts of it under his cabin, which can be discovered with a DC 20 Investigation check. The treasure he has collected consists of: 5000 GP, 25 Rubies worth 200 GP each, and 1000 GP worth of art objects. Ben Gunn is inherently suspicious of the party and offers to guide them to the treasure if they can promise him a share and to allow him to travel with them on their ship. A DC 15 Insight check reveals that he is indeed desperate to leave the island and is aware that he cannot sail a large boat on his own. If the relationship with Ben Gunn goes sour, he doesn't try to take on the party directly. Instead, he sets off some loud and bright fireworks that attracts the attention of one of the following two creatures. D5 a. T-Rex Attack A giant Tyrannosaurus-Rex thunders out of the forest, roaring in eagerness at its new meal. If the creature reaches 25hp or lower, it realizes that it has made a bad decision and attempts to flee. D5 b. Yuan-Ti Attack A Yuan-ti Abomination slithers out of the forest, hissing in anger at the intruders to its domain. It is crazy and attacks with a relentless fury. 6 TREASURE ISLAND D6. Treasure Cave Read or Paraphrase this to your players The map leads you to a dark cave situated in a forest clearing. The floor is covered in fine sand, odd for a place so far away from the beach. There are five levers on the far-side of the cave wall, each carved a human face. It appears you must choose before you can proceed any further. On the backside of the treasure map is some text that is visible when held up against sunlight or firelight, or upon a successful DC15 Intelligence check. I asked the dead crew which of them was the first to die. This is what they said: Arthur : It wasn't Charles, It was Jameson Jameson : It wasn't Lark, It wasn't Charles Lark : It was Charles, It wasn't Arthur Smith : It was Lark, It was Jameson Charles : It was Smith, It wasn't Arthur Let it be known that for each crew's answers, one statement is true and one is false. The correct answer is Lark. Upon pulling the right lever, the cave walls open up, revealing the treasure. For each incorrect lever, a Glyph of Warding goes off, dealing 4d6 in either Fire, Lightning, Cold damage (with a DC15 Dex Save for half damage) or Poison damage (with a DC15 Con Save for half damage). Treasure! In the final room, you find a veritable king's ransom of treasure: 2 0 ,0 0 0 GP 5 0 ,0 0 0 SP 1 0 0 ,0 0 0 CP 3 ,0 0 0 GP worth of Art Objects, Paintings and Statues 2 ,5 0 0 GP worth of precious and semi-precious gems 2 ,0 0 0 GP worth of jewelry such as crowns, necklaces, rings Epilogue The adventurers can now conclude the session by deciding how they wish to spend their treasure. Based on what they wish to accomplish, they can either gain the benefits either by spending their share of the loot or by succeeding on specific skill challenges. How my party spent their treasure Decided to go partying and associate themselves with high society. Rolled poorly on Intelligence and Charisma check, and ended up squandering all the money away, leaving them penniless in a few months. Decided to start a tavern. Rolled poorly on Wisdom check but rolled well on Charisma check. Ended up taking on the wrong partners and lost some money in the beginning, but has a steady stream of regular customers and is doing reasonably well. Decided to give up their share of the treasure to take on captaincy and ownership of their recently acquired vessel. Rolled reasonably well on Intelligence and Charisma check, took up a life of smuggling and made a decent living. Decided to buy a villa on the beachfront, hatch the Triceratops egg they acquired and train it to be a loyal pet, and wished to research further into the arcane arts. Rolled well on intelligence check and found a nice villa. Rolled very poorly on Animal Handlings check, leading to the creature going out of control and destroying a large portion of the city and having to be put down. Rolled very poorly on Arcana check, leading to them dabbling in pseudo-scientific studies and becoming a laughingstock in the town. Decided to become an Arms-Dealer, rolled well on Intelligence and Charisma checks, became a successful merchant of death! 7 TREASURE ISLANDNote: Yes, I know this looks terrible, but I had to come up with a treasure map on short notice for my players. They loved howterrible it looked, so I left it like this.Treasure Map8TREASURE ISLANDCredits & Legal StuffWriting & Heraldic Shield Art by https://twitter.com/artofkarthik/You can find more works from this author here - https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?author=Art%20of%20KarthikDocument designed with https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.comInspired by the famous story Treasure Island by R.L.StevensonOther art assets licensed to use in content submitted to the Dungeon Masters Guild program and published under theCommunity Content Agreement for the DMs Guild program.
