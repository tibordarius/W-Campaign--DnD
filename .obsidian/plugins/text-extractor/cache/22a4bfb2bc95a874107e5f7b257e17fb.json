I Table of Contents and Credits Introduction T he Salt Queen is having her 51st birthday, and with that; a week leading to the day is filled with celebration and events. Merchants, Warlords and nobles alike ceases their activity to pay homage and tribute for in hopes of earning her favour, appease her wrath, or partake in the final event. For on the first day of autumn, the events reaches its climax with a gauntlet consists of ship racing, maze traversing, puzzle solving, and arena fighting, all in one row!. This is infamously known as Gauntlet of The Salt Queen. To participate, potential contenders must get their hands on a ticket. There are five hundred tickets that were spread all across the continent months before the gauntlet takes place; each eligible for one team. What happens when your players got their hands on one of these tickets? Story Overview A powerful warlord and de facto ruler of Eastern Coast, Delera Mondreuz will be having her 51st birthday. To celebrate it, seven days leading up to her birthday is filled with celebrative events of all manners. When the day of her birth, first of autumn arrives; the celebration reaches its climax. The docks are packed with ships from all walks of life, merchant carts lines the bazaars and at high noon; The Gauntlet begins its opening ceremony. Backtrack to few months ago, a command was issued directly as Delera herself. As she does every year: Send out five hundred tickets to every corner of the continent, each ticket is eligible for a team for a chance to compete in The Gauntlet. These tickets then be teleported all across the continent randomly, with divinators given a clue to search on whereabouts of these tickets. Thus began a game of treasure hunting. Tickets that sprung up in settlements and cities were either used by the local officials, or auctioned at high prices. Crime syndicates' activities became mainly focused on obtaining this (if there is no pressing matters occurring that is). The Gauntlet then takes place on Delera's stronghold, port town of Windbreak; which then continues on other area in the Eastern coast region. It is said the price of winning this gauntlet is treasures so plenty, one need to use a galleon to carry it across the seas. As Players obtain one of five hundred tickets, they will have to race through the dangerous eastern storms, traverse a maze to reach a realm where they must use their brain rather than brawn to escape, finally fighting for their right to claim the title of Gauntlet Conquerors and it's prizes. About this module This module is created to serve the purpose of building a seafaring adventure. This adventure is tailored for tier 2 - 3 play, with combat as its focus. The Salt Queen's Story Delera Mondreuz, the Salt Queen herself. Her name spread terror to any other pirates. Her armada, The Red Salt; has firepower that rivals royal navies. Rumor has it she claw her way up the ranks of this armada, murdering those who would challenge her position of power. But in truth many of her man actually serves her out of respect mixed in with the fear. Born as a ship merchant's daughter, she learned the ways of sailoring and trade quickly. By age of twenty one, her ambitious ways brought riches to her father's trading company, but alas; the young and talented Delera grew bored and began searching alternatives to sate her boredom. She soon found swordsmanship to be a fun activity, taking many lesson from many swordsman money can buy One day, a pirate armada attacked a port town Delera was happened to visit. Looking at chance to have fun and show her masterful swords skills, she joins the town's defense. Though she fought bravely, the defense fell and she was soon surrounded. She cut down half of the men surrounding her before got captured, and was brought to the leader of this pirate armada. Impressed by her skills, the leader offered her a place in the crew. But, only if she can take an existing and still alive crew. She accepts, and after let loose. Brazenly she choosen what she feels suits her stature the most, the leader's seat. They then dueled, and Delera won. Thus begin her career as a pirate warlord. It has been twenty seven years since then, and ten years since she conqueror Windbreak and began the Gauntlet. 1 Introduction Adventure Pacing This module can be used as a continuation of your Player's streaks of adventures, which then you can let one of many enemy bosses drops the gauntlet ticket. If you are using this module as a start of the adventure, try using hooks we provided. If the players did stray from the story too far, the adventure should go as follows : Players first found the ticket, information about this ticket can be found in city taverns, crime syndicates, divinators, or a scrying spell will lead the players to Windbreak. Players then will require a boat to travel there, they may need to purchase a ship and hire crews unless they already have one. They then arrive on Windbreak (It is recommended that they arrive days before the gauntlet begin, as to give players chance to roam the town). While then players may explore Windbreak, acquiring aid or information from NPCs. They participate in the gauntlet and may the rolls be ever in their favor. Hooks Pirate Raid As players are taking rest, they will hear the town bell tolls. Soon after shouts of men follows. \"Pirates!\" Cannonball explosions ensues and the town is now being raided by The Red Salt detachment. As the players make their way through the city towards port, a cannonball coming directly towards the players. They have to make Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 13) to dodge initial cannonball or take 18 (4d6) Bludgeoning damage and extra 10 (3d4) Fire Damage. Entering the port, players will see a ship with black sail begins to dock. Some of the townsguards begin to converge on this ship, as they approach. The pirate raiders began to pour out of this ship and battle the defending townsguard. Players may join in and aid the townsguards, or attempt to sneak around this fight and head straight to the ship. Combat : 5 Red Salt Raiders + 2 Sea Mages | Backup : 3 Red Salt Raiders + 1 Sea mage. Stealth : Stealth Check (DC 16) for each player. Failing will draw the attention of the pirates and begin Combat. Upon making their way to the ship deck, players will notice two more ship with similar banner begins to dock as well, bringing backup for the Red Salt. Then the ship's captain notices the players. \"I see that we have a visitor to our deck. So, i reckon ye fellas be looking for an early grave? Well, HAVE AT IT!\" The Captain will begin combat with the players. Captain Shadehardt While fighting the captain, he will be accompanied by a sea mage for communication with other ships and command center, and four Pirate Raiders. These raiders will keep spawning from the lower deck until Captain Shadehardt is defeated. Upon defeating Captain Shadehardt, a team from the townsguard will enter the deck to aid players. (This can be done early if players have chosen Combat way in, or to aid players if they seems to be having a difficult time dealing with this encounter). The team's leader, Sergeant Axill will propose that they use this ship's cannon to attack other enemy ships that has docked. Players may then use the cannons to shoot at docked enemy ship, this is counted as range weapon attack. The Red Salt frigates has 16 AC and 250 HP, each cannon will deal 100 bludgeoning damage + 20 fire damage to ships. Seeing most of the docked ships are destroyed, the enemy will began to retreat while those already landed are slowly routed off. Players may attempt to loot Shadehardt's sabre Drowned. and loot this ship, to found that this ship has been emptied to make room for new plunders. In the captain's cabin however, they will found a box of gems worth 460 gold, and 370 gold coins, and a briefcase containing an invitation letter of an event called \"The Salt Queen's Gauntlet\" and a navigator map of Windbreak. If shown to Sergeant Axill, he will comment on the gauntlet event \"Ah, i see you found a gauntlet ticket. You can say that's the queen's way of celebrating her birthday, she sends out five hundreds of these invitation months before the event. Each ticket is eligible for a team, and they will competing for riches so vast; it needs a galleon to carry it they say.\" He then looks around and looks back at Shadehardt's ship. \"I don't think the old man will be using this ship anymore, why don't we get you a new sail and a set of crews. I suppose you want to try this gauntlet.\" Players will be able to re-name their ship and perhaps add some upgrades to it later. But they will be using this ship to travel to Windbreak first. 2 Adventure Hooks Monster Stats : Pirate Raid 3 Pirate Raider Medium Humaniod (any race), Neutral evil Armor Class 16 (Leather armor) Hit Points 60(12d8 + 10) Speed 30ft.

Adventure Hooks Eastern Coast E astern Coast or its people name it, Araniel's Rest; is an island clusters brimming with steep cliffs and coves such as Black cove. Few coastal settlements dot these islands with Windbreak as the largest. People usually travels to this either by airship, while merchants and fishermen still uses water ships to do their trade. What makes Araniel's Rest so infamous is its seas, with storms creating waves that can swallow frigate sized ship. Few sailors traverses this region, and even fewer conquers it. This area used to be the least charted seas in the entire continent. But dangerous seas breeds strong sailors, and richer prospects. Araniel's Rest holds some of the rarest and most exotic kinds of marine life, fishes with scales as shiny and hard as platinum are but one of the lesser examples. Drawing all sorts of fisherman to this area and a market to match it. A port town was born out of one such market, Windbreak.

Instead of taking everything and slaying everyone, she rebuilds the town and made it The Red Salt's territory; with her in control of course. Months after this event, life in that town goes back to normal. With only difference that the taxes are now paid to a pirate overlord. Travelling to Windbreak The seas leading to Eastern Coast are known to be riddled with pirates, sea monsters, wild storms, and there has been rumors of a mad storm giant traversing through the seas.

On normal circumstances, travels will take at least three days from the mainland. While using airship would require two.

Windbreak slowly becomes a trade hub for the eastern coast thanks to it's strategic place and The Salt Queen's contribution. Making the waters safe from other pirates other than The Red Salt. Ironic how a pirate armada is the peacekeeper and they are actually doing an extraordinary job. Since this area is not on any kingdom's control, there are no contrabands of sorts. Though the red salt takes a small percentage as \"tax\". A small price compared risk of having your ship seized by the government. Windbreak is surrounded by walls and is strategically located at the tip of the Stromshore Bay, its natural ascending landscape makes for a easily defendable territory. On top of the area's highest point, stands a fortress built and meant to serve The Red Salt armada; Queen's Hold. This fort has towers that overlooks the entirety of Windbreak whitlist showcase and reminder for the denizens of this town who’s in power. This town is separated into ten areas, starting with the port and market. These two areas sees the most visitor with merchants and customers doing trade, the amount of gold that circulate on this part alone is said to be enough to rebuild Windbreak ten times over.

Heading east will lead to the city's administrative district where the government runs its politics, it's also the location of the town's bank. Continue one's way east and they will arrive in the Queen's Hold. 9 Windbreak And then there's the housing areas, Upper and Lower Garam wards where majority of the native citizen live. Then there is recently built Second Wind ward, which where the wealthier citizen make their home. West of Second Wind, lies the Gilded Ward.

The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate. Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Heward's handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened. Drowned Weapon (Scimitar), rare (requires attunement) You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
