Now the threads binding this scar on our reality together are fraying, and new heroes must rise. Whispers carry in on the wind, drawing people to an island off the coast. A cavern here descends into the depths, where a grim discovery awaits. Background Two thousand years ago, a fissure along a potent magical faultline opened a gateway leading to the elemental plane of water, deep beneath the ocean. The resulting hordes of elementals and monsters that slipped through wreaked havoc on sailors and the nearby countryside, until a group of warriors fought back the tide and sealed the crack between worlds, though they themselves were sacrificed. In honour of their sacrifice, a group of people from nearby lands erected an abbey at the site of their demise, from which they would watch over the sealed portal. They became isolated in the time since, and eventually rising water levels swallowed their cathedral. Now the only means of reaching them is by descending into a cave at the centre of Wardcrest island. More recently a number of locals living near the coast closest to Wardcrest have been reported as saying they hear an uninterpretable but irresistible call that drives them out towards the ocean. None who have followed this call have returned. Overview Chapter 1 The party hear of mysterious events at Wardcrest island, make their way there and descend a cave at its centre, finding a large doorway at the bottom. Chapter 2 Gaining access to the tunnel leading down below the island, the party meet with the Drowned Faithful in the coral cathedral deep below sea level and are told of the rift forming between planes. From there they can explore wrecks, and the nearby coral reefs. Chapter 3 Drawn deeper down by a terrible rumbling, the party find an underwater ruin and a ritual in progress to bring about Leviathans return. Stopping the ritual and severing the link between planes, the party return to the cathedral and are rewarded for their efforts. Adventure Hooks • There’s a rumour in lands near Windcrest that the warriors who fought and died at a battle there left behind powerful magical weapons and armour that were never retrieved. • A local township have placed a constant watch on the coast to ensure that people drawn by the unheard call of the island don’t sail off to their doom. They offer a reward of 500gp for anyone who can put a stop to it. • The wind carries fragmented whispers in primordial when it blows in from the direction of the island. A player who speaks primordial can make a DC15 perception check to decipher them as a chant meant to call the true worshippers of the deep. • A boat captain (Sullivan “Sully” Gottfried) recently lost his wife to the call of the island, leaving him as the sole carer of their baby daughter. He’ll bring the party to Windcrest if they agree to look for her. Running this adventure Monsters in this adventure are highlighted in bold. Two of these are taken from Volo’s Guide for Monsters, and Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes, see Appendix A for these stat blocks. All other monsters can be found in the basic rules or online at D&D Beyond. Rules relating to underwater play are taken from the Dungeon Master’s guide, and are outlined in Appendix B. If underwater adventures are something you haven’t played much of before, consider taking some time to go through these and familiarise yourself with them. Magic items are in italics, and are found in Appendix C. A selection of maps are in Appendix D. General notes This adventure is balanced for a group of four players at fifth level, and assumes that they have few, if any, methods of navigating underwater. 5 Beneath the Waves While this is intentional and meant to heighten the tension, play whatever way suits your group. If you think that they would benefit from a helping hand, consider having an NPC cast Water Breathing on them to extend the amount of time they can spend in the ocean depths, or provide them with Rings of Swimming so their speed isn’t impeded and they don’t have to make exhaustion checks when swimming for longer than an hour. Similarly, if they already have spells or items which allow for this, great! That won’t detract from things overall. For larger parties, or if it seems like your group could do with more of a challenge, consider adding extra monsters to the encounters, raising difficulty checks, lowering visibility, or increasing travel distance underwater to force more exhaustion checks. Remember, you know your group best. Chapter 1 - The Call Arrival at the Island Five miles out from the coast, Wardcrest island sits nestled among an outcropping of jagged rock and rough waves. The waters here bubble and roil occasionally, and a DC14 perception check reveals that they emanate a fragmented murmuring in primordial. Characters who want to ascertain more about the island, its history, or the legend that brought them here can make a check from the below to find out more. History DC 10 reveals that this is the site of an ancient battle, a struggle fought by powerful heroes to seal the crack between our plane and the elemental plane of water. Nature DC 10 reveals that the natural features of the landscape suggest a much faster rise in sea level than what would be considered normal for the region. Religion DC 10 reveals that a group calling themselves the Drowned Faithful, formed to honour a group of warriors who fought and died here, originate from this region. Arcana DC 10 reveals that the flora and fauna of the region exhibit unnatural mutations due to exposure to high amounts of magical energies. Docking here will prove difficult, and the boats captain will need to make a DC 15 sea vehicles proficiency check to allow them to get close without risking damage to their vessel. If Sully ferries the group here on his ship, he will argue with a surly first mate over whether or not to get closer, leaving the party to choose who to side with. A smaller boat or dinghy may navigate the rocks more easily, if the party have one the DC is lowered to 10. The waters around the coast are inhabited by Hunter Sharks and Swarms of Quippers who will attack the party if they attempt to swim to shore, but can be coerced into attacking each other if prompted into a feeding frenzy by food. Wardcrest Isle the Outer Island Magical energy rising up from the depths has affected the wildlife here, causing a dense overgrowth of foliage to spring up. Some of these have become Awakened Shrubs and Awakened Trees (who can understand and speak primordial), though this is imperceptible if they don’t move. Navigating here counts as difficult terrain, and will require a DC 13 dexterity check every half mile to avoid being snagged and taking 1d6 slashing damage. Should the players choose to carve a path through the undergrowth instead, the awakened plant life will grow noticeably agitated and, if they continue, will eventually attack. Once combat begins, the shrubs and trees will attack any party members who are cutting through the undergrowth, attempting to take the responsible weapons from them. The vines carpeting the floor of the island will attempt to grapple the party. A DC 14 strength check will allow them to break free, but if the vines maintain hold on a creature for more than one round they will snake upwards and begin to restrain them. If anyone in the party can speak with the plants, they can be dissuaded from attacking and to instead allow free passage by agreeing to show deference to the natural environs of the island. During the day, a huge cloud of sea birds fly directly above the centre of the island, three miles inland. If the party arrive at night, Swarms of Bats fill the sky in the same area. Approaching the centre reveals an expansive cave, sixty feet wide and stretching down three hundred feet below. desCent IntO the Cave At the top of the cave are the ruins of a temple to the Drowned Faithful, their iconography of Beneath the Waves 6 watery swirls and closed gates recognisable by a DC 10 religion check if one hasn’t been made already. A set of cracked and broken stairs descends here, circling down for one hundred and fifty feet before becoming too worn and broken to safely traverse. Swarms of Bats and several Axe Beaks have made the craggy walls of this cave their home, the latter having adapted to their environment by developing claws on their vestigial wings which allow them to cling to the rock face and grant them a climbing speed of 40 feet. If the party linger too long, or proceed without attempting to be quiet, they will become agitated and attack. One Swarm of Bats, disturbed by the commotion, will then join the combat every two rounds that it goes unresolved. Three Giant Lizards (with the Spider Climb trait) also hunt in this cave. They can be seen crawling along the walls and attempting to eat bats, though they actively avoid Axe Beaks. If the party can lure one over to them they can attempt to ride it through a DC 16 animal handling check, which is lowered to DC 11 should they feed it. Descending the wall unaided would require a DC 15 athletics check every sixty feet, but a frayed rope also hangs loosely from a stone pillar near the bottom of the staircase. It descends a further sixty feet, though a DC 8 perception check reveals that it’s poorly knotted, and would need to be redone to be used safely. If the party try to climb down the rope without retying it they’re forced to make a DC 12 dexterity save in order to grab the nearest outcropping, or fall thirty feet to the next ledge below. Use of a properly tied rope when descending lowers the athletics check DC to 10, and they’ll need to make a DC 7 survival check once per person to ensure that it doesn’t get snagged on the way down. A long dead adventurer lies on one outcropping, eighty feet below the staircase. Their pack has been torn open and raided by the local wildlife, but they still carry a hand crossbow and two nets. If the party make the climb down during the day, light will begin to wane towards the bottom. Unless it’s midday and the sun is directly overhead, only a narrow beam will make it all the way down, leaving it dimly lit. A DC 10 perception check as they near the bottom reveals two coiled serpents lying at the base of the cave. the BOttOm Of the Cave A small, raised patch of land twenty feet wide sits at the very bottom of the cave, surrounded by water four feet deep. Several broken and twisted bodies rest in the water, either picked clean by the birds or rotted beyond consumption. A DC 14 medicine check reveals that they’re recent, none more than a month old. Most seem ill prepared for the climb downwards, but some carry weaponry (a spear and a shortsword) and a number of coins (2d10 per body). A pair of Giant Constrictor Snakes lurk in overgrown patches of wildflowers here. While more active during daylight, they will attack regardless of the time of day if disturbed. In combat they will attempt to constrict and then drown their prey. Checking their bodies after they’re defeated reveals that they had recently eaten, feeding on those who made their way to the bottom of the caves. A ragged letter tucked into the clothing of one partially digested body reads “... This... folly, Caspian... nothing on Windcrest... the voices... you... ill... please... family love you.” On one side of the cavern, ornate carved steps lead upwards to a huge aquamarine door portraying a group of warriors (a Human paladin, a Dragonborn rogue, an Elvish monk, and a Tortle Sorcerer) fighting a horde of water elementals, and deep scions. A DC 11 history check reveals this as nearly two thousand years old. Eight bowls are carved into the doors which, when weighed down with water, cause elements of the carving to move. They must be correctly balanced so as to align each of the weapons the warriors are wielding with an enemy in order to slay them and open the door. The bowls feature the phrase “Beneath the waves, they triumphed.”, each in a different language. The languages are: common, draconic, elvish, aquan, halfling, dwarvish, and gnomish. The solution is to choose the language corresponding to each warrior (common for the human, draconic for the dragonborn, elvish for the elf, and aquan for the tortle). Aquan and gnomish share a script with dwarvish, and halfling uses common script, so even if no one in the party speaks the correct languages, they may 7 Beneath the Waves be able to identify them through the script with a DC 14 history check. The door is also trapped, identifiable by a DC 16 perception check that reveals corroded sections of rock around the monsters. Should the party fill the wrong bowl, a wave of acid sprays out from the monsters in the carving, dealing 2d8 acid damage to anyone in a ten foot cone who fails a DC 16 dexterity save. Conclusion When the puzzle is solved the doors slowly open inwards, flooding the room with stale salt air and revealing a darkened staircase leading downwards. Chapter 2 - Halfway to Nowhere The Drowned Faithful staIrCase IntO the deep The air here is cold and clammy, and smells like stale seawater. Another carving stretches out from the back of the door the players enter through and down the expansive staircase. Spiralling across the ceiling, the walls, and the floor, it depicts a peaceful fishing village which is beset by monsters crawling out from the ocean. Their boats are attacked by Merrow and Water Elementals, and their loved ones are taken and drowned by Deep Scions. It shows the villagers pleading for protection, and the arrival of the Warriors of the Deep. The scene changes, following the warriors as they sail out into the centre of a whirling maelstrom and are dragged into the ocean depths. The dragonborn is overcome by water elementals and perishes as the rest fight their way towards a mass of barbed tentacles and vicious teeth. All gravely wounded now, the warriors fight back the monster, weakening it until their sorcerer can banish it back to its own plane and seal the gap between worlds. The final scene portrays the maelstrom dispersing, and the ocean crashing inwards on top of the remaining warriors. Their ship wrecked, they are dashed against the ocean shelf. The carving ends as the staircase levels out a hundred feet down onto cold wet stone covered in a layer of water an inch high. Set into a huge stone door here are carvings of the heroes in funeral positions, each in full battle regalia and clutching a carving of a weapon to their chest. The paladin carries a tremendous greatsword, the rogue holds a rapier, the monk grips a two-pronged katar, and the sorcerer clutches a staff. The door is heavy, but unlocked, and can be pushed open. the COral Cathedral Behind the door sits a vast cathedral, a crumbling stone edifice engulfed by coral. Pink, orange, yellow, green, and blue tendrils of it both devouring the ancient architecture and supporting it structurally. It spans the rafters, acting as lintel and strut, and only breaks on the thick stained-glass windows where it can’t find purchase. The floor is covered in two feet of water and grassy moss, which small fish dart in and out of. Bioluminescent algae floats in clumps on the surface, casting shimmering light across the walls and defying the cold darkness of the ocean seen outside. A huge, circular window at the front provides a view out into the murky depths. A congregation of worshippers are gathered here, hooded and kneeling in the water before a leader who stands atop a set of stone steps. All of their vestments are encrusted with coral and barnacles, as much a part of the architecture as the rest of the overrun temple. These are the drowned faithful, a group originally founded to honour the sacrifice of a group of brave warriors and protect their site of the catastrophe they averted. This function has been distorted in the time since, and the group now believe that they maintain the stability between planes through their worship here. It attracts little attention, primarily from the disenfranchised who would give up their life above the surface for one in the depths of the ocean. This misguided worship has allowed Deep Scions, ritually transformed spies made through powerful magic, to find their ways into the groups ranks. Now roughly half of the faithful are Scions, who work to reopen the rift to the elemental plane of water. When interacting with the party they will underplay the threat posed and attempt to ward off further investigation, but will not act in a way that would compromise their cover until the time is right. The leader of the congregation stands Beneath the Waves 8 watching the entrance, one of their eyes trained on the party, the other a pearl set in its socket and glinting in the shallow light. They introduce themselves as Deepseer Zethusi, de facto leader of the Drowned Faithful. While the Drowned Faithful don’t have much in the way of organisational structure, Zethusi Joka established themselves as their head through charisma and confidence alone. Tall and sleek, with tanned skin, a shaved head, and one green eye (the other having been replaced with a large pearl), Zethusi wears robes decorated with flowing patterns of bioluminescent algae. This visage belies their true form, that of an Adult Bronze Dragon. Having been drawn to the area one hundred years ago for its historical significance, the lingering magical energies here piqued their interest, and they made this place their home. They still leave to hunt and see the world, even having met the descendants of the original Warriors of the Deep, but the pitiable mortals who comprise the Drowned Faithful give them cause to check in on occasion. Zethusi is cordial to the players, and heralds their arrival as fortuitous. They refer to the groups timing as impeccable and, speaking candidly to the players, informs them that the boundary between our plane and the elemental plane of water has begun to weaken and bleed its primordial chaos into our world. A DC 16 insight check reveals that, while they are genuinely worried about the potential disaster caused by the flooding and monsters that it would bring, there’s a feverish excitement at the concept of such an intense battle. They also put forth that three of the faithful have left to investigate but have not yet returned, and request the party find out what happened to them, and complete their investigation if possible. Unbeknown to Zethusi, these three are actually Deep Scions who have set out with the intention of reopening the rift. If the party accept, they are granted one Potion of Water Breathing for each member present. Zethusi can be convinced to give the party two more with a DC 14 persuasion check, but does so reluctantly, noting that the faithful need a supply at hand in case an emergency evacuation is required. If someone in the party can already cast Water Breathing, Zethusi may instead offer them Rings of Swimming. Should the party refuse the request, Zethusi will offer them a thousand gold, claiming that they have a reasonable stockpile reclaimed from sunken ships the faithful have salvaged (an insight check contested by Zethusi’s deception reveals that this is only partially true). Either way they will offer the party beds to rest in. The rest of the cathedral is relatively plain. There are rooms for prayer, study, sleep, a library turned living room of sorts, and a kitchen. The library, while useless in the ever present dampness the cathedral is in, does contain some stone carvings depicting the warriors and some of the cathedrals history. It is built into a shelf that was once above land, and has been swallowed beneath rising water levels as a result of its proximity to the planar rift. The sleeping quarters are up a small set of stairs, kept relatively dry in comparison to the rest of the cathedral. The beds are stone bases with mattresses of sea sponge and blankets of woven together seaweed. Most have a footlocker containing whatever sparse possessions the faithful have. A shared living space, these quarters house all of the faithful with the exception of Deepseer Zethusi. The Deepseers quarters are kept separate, and are locked with a key that they keep on their person. A DC 15 thieves tools check will unlock the door, revealing a room with a large bed, carvings on the walls of a map of the known world - a DC 15 history check will reveal that this is a depiction of the world two thousand years ago, as several nations it displays no longer exist - and a carved section of wall that almost precisely mirrors the carving on the inner entrance to the cathedral. Where this carving differs is in the weapons positions, none of which are being held by the appropriate warrior. This carving is actually a door that leads to Zethusi’s hoard (see the Rewards section in the final chapter for its contents), and will open if the weapons are returned to their rightful wielders. It does, however, also bear a Glyph of Warding, which contains an Alarm spell. This triggers if the door is pushed open without first speaking the command word. An airlock is situated at the outer edges of the cathedral, through a sealed hallway separated from the body of the cathedral proper. The party are granted access here, as a means of egress. A circular stone aperture can be opened and closed by means of a crank, with a second one controlling the outer exit. There are three Candles of the Deep kept here, which 9 Beneath the Waves may be borrowed if the party have no means of generating light. A Median the OCean shelf The cathedral airlock opens out onto an underwater plain. During the day, light from the surface still reaches to this depth (four hundred feet below the surface). The coral that has embraced the cathedral grows here also, having formed on the husks of wrecked ships, long since rotted beyond recognition. Stray magical energies have interwoven with the coral, imbuing it with volatile magical properties. If harvested correctly through a DC 14 nature check (with advantage if its properties are identified first with a DC 9 Arcana check) it can serve as alchemical ingredients, which can then be distilled down into potions with the same effects. If improperly harvested, however, a random effect from the below table is triggered. D10 Effect 1 A foul cloud bursts forth - 2d6 poison damage and reducing vision to 10 feet for 5 minutes. 2 - 5 The plant dissolves into a phosphorescent mist which clings to the skin - disadvantage on stealth checks for 15 minutes. 6 - 9 It collapses inwards and explodes out in a wave - 3d6 force damage to anything in a 15 foot sphere. 10 A Water Weird emerges and attacks the harvester. WreCks Scattered around the shelf are the remains of three wrecks, all of which appear to have only recently sunk. Two of these are smaller, privately owned ships, the other a larger trading ship. Exploring each bears rewards, but be sure to point out to the party that doing so will take time - which carries the risk of severe exhaustion when swimming at this depth, or running out of time for those using potions of water breathing. Thoroughly search the smaller ships takes fifteen minutes, and a half hour for the larger one. This can be shortened by five minutes each with successful DC 15 investigation checks, but if they roll lower than a 10 the process instead takes five minutes longer. Ship 1 is home to a Banshee. While she is aware of the group, she will not actively seek to engage them. If they approach she will use Horrifying Visage to dissuade them from further exploration, but should they proceed she will use her wail and begin combat. Using Incorporeal Movement she can easily pass through the walls of the ship, attacking and moving outside and out of reach to prevent retaliation. If defeated, she will warn the party of “a ritual in the deep” before dissipating. Within the wreck she guards are a number of magically augmented clams. When harvested with a DC 16 nature check, the clams yield 1d4 +1 Pearls of Wisdom. Ship 2 is particularly badly damaged, and being consumed by poisonous, grasping seaweed. A DC 11 nature check allows the party to ascertain that the seaweed is dangerous. If they venture too close it entangles them, forcing them to make a DC 13 dexterity check or take 2d6 poison damage and be grappled. Once grappled, the seaweed will begin to tighten its grip, snaking around the victims neck and causing them to suffocate. At the beginning of each of their turns the victim takes a further 1d6 poison damage and can repeat the dexterity save to break free, but starting from turn two they will be unable to breathe. An intact healers kit and a pouch containing 50GP can be seen in the wreckage, but careful navigation is required here to avoid the seaweed. Ship 3 is a trading ship which has seen most of its cargo carried off by the tide. Some remains in the hold, but a pair of ancient lobsters, grown massive and mutated by proximity to the rift, make it their home. These lobsters use the statistics of a Chuul except for the ability to understand Deep Speech, which they lack. Territorial by nature, they will attack the party if they venture into the lower decks where the hold is located. An offering of magical items to feed on (which can also include harvested coral) can convince them to abandon attacking, as they will immediately cease in order to feed unless continually provoked. A locked DC 15 chest in the hold contains three Potions of Greater Healing, two Potions of Water Breathing, a Potion of resistance, and an anchor Quaals Feather Token. A skeleton holding a set of Beneath the Waves 10 keys, none of which open the chest, sits beside it, ragged clothing hovering wraith-like in the waves. Conclusion Once the party have finished exploring, or immediately following a rest if they take one, a deep rumble begins to rise from the water below the shelf and the cathedral. Flashes of dark light follow, briefly illuminating a gargantuan shape in the dark abyss. Chapter 3 - Leviathan Emerges Descent to the Mariners Grave Open Water and the OCean flOOr Light begins to wane below the shelf, reducing visibility. Giant Sharks can also be found hunting here, feeding primarily on Giant Octopuses but equally willing to snack on a passing adventurer. A crack in the shelf extends deeper towards the ocean floor, providing cover from hunters in the open water while also forcing anything medium or larger to squeeze through. The long neck of a Plesiosaurus or dextrous tentacles of a Giant Octopus could reach through to attack, however, and will do so if they sense the party. Another two hundred feet down, the ocean floor comes into view. Three scattered sets of vestments, discarded by the Deep Scions who left the church, can be found half-buried in the silt here, leading away from the shelf and cathedral. A successful DC 10 investigation check reveals no signs of a struggle, and a DC 17 survival check allows the party to track signs of humanoid bodies being dragged away to the west. Failing the check still allows them to track the Deep Scions, but doing so will take more time, allowing them to progress further into their ritual. These tracks, as well as a smell of sulphur which can be traced by a DC 12 nature check, lead towards an underwater volcano. temple Of levIathan Half a mile out from the shelf the volcano comes into view, a red and blue glow illuminating the area around its vent. It sits at the centre of the remains of a ruined temple, an undulating circle of sigils carved into the rock of the surrounding floor. The three Deep Scions stand here in their hybrid form, in a triangular shape at three larger, glowing sigils around the crater, fifty feet apart and chanting in primordial. Four bodies lay at cardinal points on the edge of the volcano, embalmed entirely in seaweed which is emblazoned with further arcane symbols, and rocks on their chests whose carvings mimic the wrappings weighing them down. Here, the Deep Scions are conducting a ritual to open the rift to the plane of water once more. If the party failed to follow either the tracks leading here or the smell of sulphur (unless they swam through dangerous open water), one Deep Scion begins to sacrifice the bodies into the volcano at the moment party arrive. If they failed both checks, the ritual is well underway and only three bodies remain. Should the party make themselves known and interrupt the ritual, two of the Deep Scions will attempt to rapidly drop the bodies into the volcano. If any of the bodies are damaged or removed by the party, the Deep Scions will carve the sigil on the rocks into their flesh and dive into the volcano of their own volition. Once four bodies have been consumed in this way, Leviathan is summoned. Elemental Ferocity When this begins, the waters start to roil and a deep rumble emanates from the innards of the volcano, followed by a billowing plume of smoke and the sound of an immense tearing. The Scions primordial chanting rises until it’s painfully loud, reverberating and distorted by the water, and the carved glyphs on the temple floor crackle and spark with arcane energy. Within the smoke, features begin to take shape. An enormous maw roars into the deep, and a gargantuan serpentine body uncoils slowly from within the mouth of the volcano. If they haven’t already, the players must roll initiative. fIghtIng the levIathan While the Leviathan has begun to enter the material plane, this is not an instantaneous process. Any remaining Deep Scions will attempt to fend off the players, and Water Elementals slowly start to emerge from the rift to join the fray. The first five rounds play out as below. 11 Beneath the Waves • Round 1: All but one of the Deep Scions attack, with the final one remaining chanting. Unless only one remains, in which case it will attack. • Round 2: The Leviathan can engage in combat, but can’t move or use its tidal wave. • Round 3: If the praying Deep Scion is alive and has maintained concentration, a Water Elemental emerges and joins initiative. • Round 4: Zethusi, in her true form of an adult bronze dragon (though still recognisable by one pearlescent eye) arrives and engages the Leviathan. • Round 5: The Leviathan can now move and use its Tidal Wave ability. In order to reseal the rift and cut the Leviathan off from our world, the party will need to stop the praying Deep Scion, destroy the glowing sigils at the three points where they stood, and find a way to close off the maw of the volcano. If they don’t pick up on this, Zethusi will prompt them once she joins combat. Finale Conclusion A If Zethusi survives, she will ferry the party back to the temple. The waters there are darkened with blood, and the corpses of several of the faithful are laid out on the alter in the main prayer room. Zethusi explains that the scions had infiltrated their ranks, and attempted to slaughter them all once the ritual began. They also explain the origins of the scions - that they were human once, and the forms they revert to when they die were their true forms. They tell the party of the ritual performed to corrupt these people and turn them into the monsters that the party fought, a ritual which binds them to the service of an evil master. If you have an ongoing villain in your campaign, this would be a good point to tie them in to this story. Regardless of whether the party previously agreed on a fee with Zethusi, they will be taken to the dragons hoard. There, each member of the party will receive 800gp as well as a choice of either a piece of weaponry or armour (see the Rewards section) which belonged to the ancient warriors. Zethusi will not willingly part with the full sets of both weapons and armour, if prompted to they tell the party that they’ll need to save the world a second time for that. Zethusi will also acknowledge themselves as allies of the party, and offer to join them in combat if there’s ever another battle of such importance. Conclusion B If Zethusi dies, the party are left in silence as the waves cease churning and become calm once more. If they make their way back to the cathedral they find a gory battle has taken place, with multiple corpses of the faithful laid out on the alter in the main prayer room. Those who remain explain that they were attacked by members who were secretly scions and were saved by Zethusi, but have no further information as to what the scions were. They were thought to be the stuff of myth, seemingly totally indistinguishable from normal people. If you would like to tie this in to your main campaign, consider including an identifying mark on the body of the Scions, or something which indicated their place of origin. Without Zethusi present, the faithful will seek to provide the party with payment in their stead. They have access to the hoard, and will fetch from it 450gp per party member, along with the armour and weaponry of the ancient warriors (see the Rewards section). The stipulation of only one piece of weaponry or armour per party member still applies, however, as these are considered holy relics to the faithful. They can be convinced with a DC 13 persuasion check to part with more gold, bringing the total amount given to the party up to 2,200gp. Regardless of which conclusion occurs, the faithful will lead the party back to the entrance stairway to the cathedral. There, halfway up the stairs, a section of the relief can be pushed, opening a side passage that reveals a far less ornate staircase which ascends to the top of the island and ends in a concealed entrance on the side of a rock face. Rewards Zethusi’s hoard is a mass of glittering gold, platinum, and gems. Of note are a variety of old weapons, armour, and books on military history. Details of the equipment owned by the Warriors of the Deep are outlined in appendix C.

The wall is up to 250 feet long, up to 250 feet high, and up to 50 feet thick. When the wall appears, all other creatures within its area must each make a DC 24 Strength saving throw. A creature takes 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. At the start of each of the leviathan’s turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any other creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from the leviathan.

In water, the psychic screech also telepathically transmits the deep scion’s memories of the last 24 hours to its master, regardless of distance, so long as it and its master are in the same body of water. Beneath the Waves 14 Appendix B: Relevant Rules Swimming (dmg pg. 116/117) Unless aided by magic, a character can’t swim for a full 8 hours per day. After each hour of swimming, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. A creature that has a swimming speed-including a character with a ring of swimming or similar magician swim all day without penalty and uses the normal forced march rules in the Player’s Handbook. Swimming through deep water is similar to traveling at high altitudes, because of the water’s pressure and cold temperature. For a creature without a swimming speed, each hour spent swimming at a depth greater than 100 feet counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining exhaustion. Swimming for an hour at a depth greater than 200 feet counts as 4 hours. Underwater Visibility (dmg pg. 117) Visibility underwater depends on water clarity and the available light. Unless the characters have light sources, use the Underwater Encounter Distance table to determine the distance at which characters underwater become aware of a possible encounter. Underwater Encounter Distance Creature Size Encounter Distance Clear water, bright light 60 ft. Clear water, dim light 30 ft. Murky water or no light 10 ft. Suffocating (phb pg. 183) A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying.
