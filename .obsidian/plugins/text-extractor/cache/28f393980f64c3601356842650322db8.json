It is designed to fit into almost any setting or campaign.G Adventure Supplements. This adventure is designed to work with the Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition rules. You will need the Player’s Handbook, the Dungeon Master Guide and the Monster Manual to get the most out of this adventure. For more information about Dungeons and Dragons, visit dungeonsanddragons.com. Distribution. You are encouraged to share this document. It must be shared in full and unaltered. You may not charge for it, nor may you use it in any way for commercial purposes. Finalisation. This document is complete, though newer versions containing corrections may be released. It was last edited 1 November 2017. Find newer versions at http://deck16.net/dnd BACKGROUND Somewhere in your campaign world there is a rugged, isolated coastline. Along that coastline are a series of natural caverns. In those caverns live a small community of pirates and outlaws: Greger’s Grotto. The main feature of Greger’s Grotto is a large underwater cave, where less-than-legal ships can moor out of sight of navies and coastguards. Here they can trade in stolen and illegal wares and stock up on provisions. All for a small fee, of course. The other attraction of Greger’s Grotto is the arena. Like anyone, bandits and thieves desire entertainment. For generations the Greger family has turned a profit by buying slaves and beasts and setting them on one another in the arena. These bloodsports don’t turn a direct profit, but they do encourage the Grotto’s lawless visitors to stay longer or return more frequently than they might otherwise. And more visitors means more fees. The PC are the newest lot of slaves forced to fight in the arena. Can they survive the arena combat, and the harsh prison lifestyle? Will they ultimately be able to escape? CONVENTIONS USED The following conventions are used in this document. Sections. Part 1 contains an overview of the adventure and information for running it. Part 2 is where the game begins, it’s the adventure’s introduction. The main body of the adventure is divided into three parts, one for each general area, in the rough order that the PCs are likely to encounter them. Part 3 details the prisoner caverns. Part 4 documents the arena, including rules for arena battles. Part 5 is for the upper “living areas” of Greger’s Grotto. Appendix A contains information for NPCs and creatures unique to this adventure. It is strongly recommended you, as the DM, read this entire adventure document before attempting to run it. Book References. For your convenience page numbers from the Player’s Handbook (PHB), the Dungeon Master Guide (DMG) and the Monster Manual (MM) are listed when they are relevant. For example, DMG123 refers to page 123 of the Dungeon Master’s guide. Page numbers were accurate with books available at the time of writing. Creatures and NPCs are listed with bold names. If the creature or NPCs has a reference to the Monster Manual, look it up there. Otherwise, look for it in Appendix A. Maps. Areas on the map are referred to by a short code in square brackets, such as [2A]. The number refers to the Part that this map and room description can be found in: information on [3B] could be found in Part 3. Note that not every letter is used, those that might be mistaken for other letters or numbers (such as I and O) are purposely skipped. Each square on the grid represents five feet (PHB192, DMG242, DMG250). The following map symbols are used: From left: door, locked door, secret door. Number Ranges and Subtraction. You will encounter die roll value such as “1d20 – 14 guards” or “1d12 – 6 gems”. This indicates subtraction: 1d20 minus 14 guards, not 1d20 to 14 guards. Unless otherwise specified, the minimum is always zero. (It does not make sense to have negative guards or negative gems!) These ranges often lead to zero as a common or even most likely result – that is by design. LIKELY FLOW OF EVENTS It’s impossible to predict exactly what your players might do, but here’s a probable sequence: Introduction. The PCs fight in the arena as per the introductory section. They are then moved to the prison caverns. Prisoners. While in prison, the PCs do four main things: 1. Survive. Food, water and sleep are essentials. The PCs will probably want to maximise activity while still allowing for enough downtime to recover from injuries. 2. Interact with other prisoners. The PCs might make friends or enemies. 3. Explore adjacent caverns. This allows the PCs to get a small amount of XP and allows them to find useful PART 1: OVERVIEW 3 gear which could help them escape. 4. Fight or train in the arena. The PCs can be summoned from the prison to the arena. In combat they can gain XP but risk death or injury. Escape. There is no way out for the PCs except escape. Escape is something they must plot and execute – this is “sandbox” affair rather than a pre-written set of encounters. They might escape by cunning or stealth, slipping away undetected. They might rally their fellow prisoners and mastermind a rebellion. Or they might simply slaughter anyone who stands in their way. In most cases their plans will be a combination of the above, some planned, some improvised. The adventure is designed such that the PCs are unlikely to be able to escape immediately. They are going to want to gain one or two levels before any attempt. Generally speaking, this should happen naturally by the time they’ve put together a plan. If not, there’s no harm in them purposely delaying an escape so they can “train” in the arena. THE PLAYERS Character Advancements. This adventure suits a party of approximately four 1st level characters. By the end of the adventure they should have reached 3rd level. Level Limitation. This adventure is non-linear. It’s hard to predict experience gain. The arena alone is random and (potentially) endlessly repeatable. You should cap the PCs at 3 rd level. A party of 4th level PCs will find the content too easy. (If you are feeling generous you could cap them just before 4th level, and allow them to attain it at the conclusion of the adventure.) XP Sharing. If your PCs are working as a team, it makes sense that they are all awarded XP equally, even if they aren’t all present for the encounter or event that gives the XP. If the fighter got beaten up trying to save the party’s food rations from thieving orc prisoners, she shouldn’t be penalised for not being able to attend the arena combat later that day. Milestones. You could award XP when certain milestones are reached (DMG261, DMG82). The following make good major milestones: • The PCs escape from Greger’s Grotto. • The PCs help a large number of NPC prisoners escape without too many casualties. • Each time the PCs are victorious in a special arena combat (one that is especially hard, or has story significance). • For named NPCs (see Appendix A) of CR 2 or greater: the PCs either defeat such an NPC, or convince them to become an ally. • The PCs have finalised their escape plan and are soon to enact it. The following make good minor milestones: • The PCs help NPC prisoners escape, but didn’t qualify for the major milestone version; either because they helped only a small group of prisoners or there were a large number of casualties. • The PCs are victorious in an unimportant arena combat. • For named NPCs (see Appendix A) of CR 1 or lower: the PCs either defeat such an NPC, or convince them to become an ally. • The PCs explore the Spider Cavern [3G]. • The PCs explore most or all of the Haunted Caverns [3 J] to [3Q]. • The first time the PCs successfully navigate an underwater tunnel in [3C] or [3D]. • The first time the PCs smuggle an item into prison. • The PCs make an important step toward escape that isn’t already covered by a minor milestone above. Defiant Personalties. Any PC whose sense of honour, or freedom, or grand ego means they would never ever submit to captors will be unconscious or dead within minutes of starting this adventure. Do not let the players create PCs with extremely defiant personalities. Encounter Difficulty and Metagame Thinking. The arena, and some dungeon-like parts of this adventure are crafted within the bounds of traditional combat encounters (DMG81); they might be easy or hard but should never be impossible. (Indeed, if they are, you as DM should tweak them.) But this isn’t always the case. Attack a prisoner or a prison guard, for example, and he’ll call for help. In a worst-case scenario the PCs could have the entire guard population mobilised against them. You should forewarn your players about this, without giving away details. Essentially, they should drop any metagame thinking (DMG235) they might have about combat encounters and actually think about potential enemies before they start a fight. CHANGING THE ADVENTURE You can and should modify this adventure to suit your needs (DMG72). RANDOMNESS This adventure has many random elements, from minor things like amounts of coin to major things like the nature of arena battles. The randomness exists as a tool to assist you, as DM; not as something to restrain you (DMG236). If you want to re-roll, or pick a particular result, or do something else entirely you should; whether it be for story reasons, challenge reasons, or any other reason. DIFFICULTY Like any adventure, the players’ competencies and the party composition can impact on how easy or hard things are. As DM, it’s up to you to tweak the adventure to suit. PART 1: OVERVIEW 4 What follows are considerations specific to this adventure. Escape Difficulty: Magic and Wild Shape. It’s quite difficult to escape the Grotto by mundane means. But magic could assist. There are not (to the author’s knowledge) any Player’s Handbook spells or class abilities accessible to 3rd level players that make escape trivially easy. But do not underestimate the creativity of players. Or capabilities added by expansion material. The druid Wild Shape ability (PHB66) does make escape easy. A druid could conceivably turn into a small crawling insect (such as a spider) to escape. If only some of the PCs can escape easily that doesn’t matter: most parties won’t want to leave any party members behind. Even if the druid and the wizard can escape at any time, they’re not going to help the fighter and rogue escape by just waiting outside. So, you only need be concerned if all your players can escape easily, be it through Wild Shape, a clever application of magic, or anything else. If such a scenario comes up you might modify the adventure to nullify the easy escape: perhaps the Grotto has magic that inhibits shapeshifting. Or you could task your players with the goal of saving the NPC prisoners and/or shutting down Greger’s operations rather than simply escaping. Combat Difficulty: Encounters per Day. Adventuring parties typically handle six to eight combat encounters per day (DMG84). Until the PCs attempt an escape it is unlikely they will reach this quota. Part 3 has a section called “Battle Difficulty” that describes way to increase the challenge of arena combat to counter-act this. Another alternative is to use rule variants that slow down healing and make rests harder to take (DMG267). (The “Gritty Realism” variant is too harsh in this setting. Reduce its long rest time to 24 hours.) If you don’t want to use these variants for the rest of your campaign you could decree that they’re a temporary thing caused by the harsh prison conditions. Combat Difficulty: Monks and Cantrips. Much of this adventure sees the PCs lacking decent equipment. Certain classes (such as monks and any class with damaging cantrips) are dangerous in combat without any equipment. If you have one or two PCs of these classes, that’s fine. If you have more, you may wish to increase the difficulty. This is especially true in sections of the adventure where the PCs have extremely limited access to equipment, such as in the prisons in Part 2. You may wish to furnish the prisoner NPCs with a range of smuggled weapons (daggers), hand- made weapons (clubs) or improvised weapons (PHB147). STORYTELLING It is up to you as DM to build a story on top of the framework you are given, should you want to. A detailed story may not fit your play style (DMG34). Maybe your players would rather just win arena fights and hack down guards. If you do desire a story, consider building one on-the-fly based on the players’ actions. You’ll find some ideas throughout this document. Especially see Appendix A, which has story idea sections for many of the NPCs. VARIANT: AT HIGHER LEVELS This adventure is written for levels 1 to 3, but it wouldn’t be hard to tweak for higher levels. Here’s what you might need to do: Toughen Up Named NPCs. It should be fairly apparent what class or classes they are – just add more! Optionally, you can provide them with better equipment. Toughen Up Guards and Prisoners. Re-build these NPCs as you would make PCs, but with the appropriate racial traits (DMG282). Replace Independents and Arena Beasts. There’s plenty of choice in the Monster Manual. For instance, a scout might be too weak for a high-level party, but an assassin wouldn’t be. An arena battle against a brown bear will be trivial but a battle against a cyclops will not. Add Magical Protections. High-level characters have access to spells and abilities that might make escape trivial. You may need to add protections against this, be it collars that inhibit certain abilities or anti-magic barriers on easy escape points. Think carefully about each PC in your party; what might they do to escape, and what plausible protections might the Greger family take? Adjust Rewards. You may wish to increase the amount of coin carried by foes in this adventure. In rooms that contain treasure and items, you may wish to add to the spoils or replace them with something more fitting. Glamourise the Grotto. Greger’s Grotto is a hideout for low-level thieves, bandits and pirates; run by a fairly middling crime family. That’s hardly the setting for high- level heroes, even if they are prisoners. You may want to elevate the Grotto: perhaps it is an exclusive community of elite criminals and rich black marketeers, resplendent with luxury: fine furnishings, aged wide, and a waiting servant at every corner. VARIANT: PCS AREN’T PRISONERS There’s no reason why you couldn’t throw away the “escape from prison” plot and just use Greger’s Grotto as a setting in your campaign. As a Dungeon. Good-aligned PCs might be tasked with the relatively mindless task of clearing the Grotto: raiding it as they would raid a crypt or labyrinth; slaying bandits and guards as they would skeletons and mummies. As a Quest Setting. Parties of any alignment might accept quests to infiltrate the Grotto. The Greger family has many enemies both criminal and lawful. The PCs might be tasked with stealing documents, recovering treasure, assassinating a visiting bandit, or freeing prisoners. One quest could lead to PART 1: OVERVIEW 5 another, making good use of the Grotto as a setting. As a Home Base. Criminally-minded PCs might use the Grotto as a home base (DMG15): a place to recuperate, shop, and pick up new jobs. Indeed, the Gregers themselves may make for excellent quest-givers. WHAT’S NEXT? You might link this adventure to your next one (DMG125). Escape from the Grotto. The journey back to civilisation might not be easy. It may involve wilderness travel (DMG106). NPCs from the Grotto may be enraged enough to pursue the PCs. Return to the Grotto. If the PCs managed to escape the Grotto without too much disruption they may wish to return at a later date. They might wish to rescue still-trapped prisoners, or they may simply want revenge. Quite possibly security has been increased since their break-out, or maybe a “dead or alive” bounty on the PCs means that previously uninterested visitors to the Grotto are now likely to be enemies. Slaver Slayers. The PCs may want revenge on whoever sold them to Greger’s Grotto in the first place. Good-aligned PCs might just want to stamp out slave trading. The PCs might find clues in Gladwin Greger’s documents, or get leads from any still-living criminals in the Grotto. New Owners. The PCs might occupy Greger’s Grotto. They could re-purpose it as their personal stronghold (DMG128). If they’re of a less ethical persuasion they might simply take it over as-is, replacing the Greger family and allowing criminal trade to continue. Either option may not be easy as opportunistic criminal types (and maybe any surviving Gregers) rush to fill the power vacuum. Sailing. This link works well if the PCs escaped by taking one of the pirate vessels moored at Greger’s Grotto. Perhaps they plan to sail back to civilisation, or they may intend to start a new life on the seas. Pirates may be in pursuit of the stolen ship. Deeper Dungeons. As the PCs explored the caverns below the Grotto, maybe they overlooked a passageway that leads into an expansive dungeon. The coastal nature of the Grotto might suit a lair of kuo-toa (MM199), lizardfolk (MM204), merrow (MM219), sahuagin (MM263) or even a sea hag (MM179). PART 1: OVERVIEW 6 PART 2: INTRODUCTION he campaign opens with the PCs being thrust into gladiatorial combat, whether they like it or not.T TAKING UP ARMS The sack-cloth is removed from your head. “Take them!” barks one of the hobgoblin guards, gesturing to a table laden with weapons and other equipment. For weeks, maybe months, you’ve been a prisoner in-transit. Sit down, stand up, march, eat, sleep; these are commands you’re used to. But now your captors invite you to take up arms? You take in your situation. You’re in a small, dank chamber. The only furniture is a battered old table on which rests a selection of gear. There are two exits. Your guards block one that leads into darkness. Another exit leads out, via a short tunnel, to sunlight. With you are several other prisoners, filthy and clothed in rags. They appear to be as confused as you are. Player characters. The PCs are, of course, the prisoners in this chamber [4D]. The only possessions they have are rags for clothing. They are fully healthy. Spell-casters have spells memorised. Whether the PCs have met previously is up to you, but it may be more entertaining if they are thrust into this scenario as strangers. Table. On the table are several well-used but serviceable weapons: 2 daggers, 2 maces, 1 net, 2 shields, 2 shortswords, 2 spears, 2 scimitars and 1 whip (PHB149). There is also a selection of arcane foci, druidic foci and holy symbols (PHB150); any spell-casting character will be able to find something that suits them. Finally, any wizard PCs will find their spellbook on the table, taken from them back when they were captured as prisoners. Guards. Twice as many hobgoblin guards as there are PCs. Be sure to make clear their fearsome nature: these are hobgoblins, not goblins. The guards aren’t talkative. They will direct the PCs to take equipment and head outside. They will punish disobedience with violence, escalating to lethal force if threatened, though they will favour knocking out the PCs (PHB198) rather than killing them. If the PCs start to win against the guards, have more guards join the fray. If the PCs are neutralised, they will be moved to the slave grottos as if they had lost the arena combat. THE ARENA Sooner or later the PCs should move through the tunnel. You proceed through the tunnel and into the sunlight. The roar of a crowd reaches your ears. This is a makeshift arena inside a deep natural shaft. The bottom, where you stand, is roughly circular and eighty feet in diameter. It is covered in fine white sand and littered with scraps of ruined armour and spatters of blood. The walls of the shaft are near- vertical. Some forty feet up a viewing area has been hewn from the rock; this is where the small crowd of several dozen cheer from. The crowd consists of a diverse mix: mostly humans, hobgoblins and goblins, but some orcs and bugbears too. Over a hundred feet up the walls give way to a clear blue sky. Behind you, a heavy metal gate slams shut. It’s operated by a winch from the viewing area above. On the other side of the arena is another group of prisoners much like yourself. A voice bellows from above. “Some new blood to the arena!” PART 2: INTRODUCTION 7 It’s a human, a bald man with a thick black beard. He seems to be presiding over this whole affair. He points at your group. “This lot have newly arrived. They’ve not even had the time to unpack and settle into their lodgings!” The crowd laughs. “We want to give them every chance to see their new accommodation, so fighting against them are our next newest guests; this lot have only been with us for a few days.” The man raises his open palm melodramatically. “Begin!” he shouts. The prisoners opposite you look nervous. They hesitate, but after sharing a few nods of grim determination they begin to charge at you. If you need more details about the arena, look in Part 4, especially [4A]. The Other Prisoners. As many Human Prisoners as there are PCs. They do not relish attacking the PCs, but are too frightened by the consequences of disobedience to do otherwise. If they are winning in combat, or they have reason to believe the PCs are likewise hesitant to fight, they may attempt to knock out the PCs (PHB198). The Announcer. Is Gladwin Greger. He is this battle’s editor (organiser). Feel free to have him make remarks and quips as the match progresses. He will ultimately announce when the battle ends. Since this is a match between newcomers he may waive the usual rule of “only one team left standing” so long as there’s a clear winning team. Disobedience. Escape is very difficult with the sheer rock walls and sturdy gates. Opportunities to attack the guards or audience are few, but if a PC manages to find a way the guards will retaliate. See Part 4 for guidance if any PC insists on taking these courses of action. AFTER THE FIGHT All participants are ushered back to the preparation room [4D] where they will surrender weapons. They will then be taken through [4F] and left in [3A] where their adventure begins in earnest. Incapacitated Combatants. Still-standing combatants are expected to carry incapacitated members of their own team; guards will grudgingly help if required. All living combatants are left in [3A]; corpses are disposed of in [4E]. Spellbooks. Nothing is permitted to be taken from the arena or the preparation rooms. The only exceptions are spellbooks – indeed, the guards will insist the party take their spellbooks. This is because it is known prisoners need these to prepare magic, and magic makes for entertaining crowd- pleasing fights. The guards know their magic-using prisoners are too inexperienced to perform very dangerous or disruptive magic. Disobedience. If your PCs do not obey the guards see Part 4 for more information about procedures for handling prisoners. PART 2: INTRODUCTION 8 PART 3: THE CAVERNS ot all of Greger Grotto’s natural caverns are as impressive as the arena and the underground docks. The same geologic processes also riddled the area with smaller caverns, many of which extend underwater.N Some of these darker, more claustrophobic caverns are considered an excellent place to house prisoners, including the PCs. Adjoining the prisoners’ caverns are several other caverns. Few prisoners know of the adjoining caverns, and even fewer venture into them. Yet they might present opportunities for brave PCs. PART 3: THE CAVERNS 9 COMMON FEATURES All areas in Part 3 have the following properties, unless otherwise specified by individual descriptions. Caverns. All rooms this section are natural, and so feature uneven walls (the neat squares shown on the map are a simplification). Ceilings vary in height from 10 to 30 feet, usually highest in the centre. Stalactites are common. Light. Unless otherwise mentioned, all areas are in darkness (PHB183). PRISONER CAVERNS Areas [3A], [3B], [3C] and [3D]. Living areas for prisoners. The “true” starting area of this adventure, after the introduction. PRISONER FACTIONS The prisoners are divided into four factions. These factions are distrustful of one another but exist in a state of fragile peace. Prisoner Equipment. Guards do not permit prisoners to take anything into the caverns beyond the rags they wear. Some prisoners have smuggled weapons in or managed to fashion them out of refuse, but this is very rare. Prisoner Routine. While not summoned to the arena, prisoners almost always stay in the cavern claimed by their clique. There’s little to do beyond resting, sparring, bathing and talking. In times of heightened tensions some prisoners may be assigned as sentries. Light Sleepers. No-one sleeps deeply in a cut-throat prison. Sleeping prisoners can make use of passive perception (PHB177), though at disadvantage. Language. Many prisoners only speak their racial language (PHB123). Prisoners have a chance to know extra languages – Common, Goblin or Orc – though fluency may be poor. See the entries in Appendix A for details. Interaction. It’s up to the PCs whether they befriend or antagonise their fellow prisoners. Ideally, they could serve as allies in an escape, though gaining trust will not be easy. It is possible to talk with any prisoner, but for anything important prisoners will defer to their leader. Use the table below for random conversation topic ideas. Feel free to embellish. Topics aren’t always truthful – just something a prisoner believes. Divulge these with roleplaying or interaction ability checks as you see fit (PHB186, DMG244). d20 Topic 1 Food and water supplies are irregular. Keeping some reserve provisions is a good idea if you can manage it. 2 In the arena it is possible to indicate surrender by raising one’s hand with an open palm. If the crowd approves, the defeated combatant will be spared. But in some battles surrender is forbidden. 3 Prisoners are sometimes taken to do manual labour. 4 Horrible sea monsters occasionally emerge from the pools to drag prisoners back down into the water. (Untrue.) 5 Sometimes a fiery red glow can be seen in the empty cavern. This is the ghost of a dead prisoner! (Partially true. The glow exists, but is not caused by a ghost. It is caused by roaming fire beetles from [3H].) 6 There are secret passages all through Greger’s Grotto. I heard there was one in: (pick one at random) the refuse pit, the guard barracks, the bottom of the pools of water, the empty cavern adjoining the hobgoblin cavern, one of the preparation rooms. (Some true, some untrue.) 7 Godrick Greger is a necromancer. He claims the corpses of those that die in the arena. That’s why he is so eager to see combatants die. (Untrue.) 8 A rival pirate faction is preparing to take over Greger’s Grotto, it should happen any day now. (Untrue.) 9 There are two types of arena fights; those between prisoners, and those where prisoners face fearsome beasts. 10 The Greger family has run the arena for generations. 11 Gertrude Greger is the kindest editor. You’re lucky if you get her. 12 Jisthelek the Grasping, the leader of the goblin prisoners, has escaped many times. But he comes back voluntarily. (Untrue.) 13 The guard room contains a large iron bell which they ring to summon reinforcements. 14 Drusus Skull-Skewer, the leader of the guards, is so honourable he cannot refuse a one-on-one duel. (Untrue.) 15 Gladwin Greger admires courage in the face of death so much that he is more likely to let a downed arena combatant live if they don’t surrender. (Untrue.) 16 Xanthe Jonquil, leader of the human prisoners, is an excellent healer. 17 It is rumoured that, many years ago, some dwarf prisoners managed to escape. There must be a secret way out of these caverns. 18 It is possible to win freedom by winning ten battles in a row. (Untrue.) 19 Gillian Greger often flirts with prisoners while editor. She has had affairs with several; including orcs and hobgoblins. (By default this is untrue, but you could make it partially or wholly true if desired.) 20 Sometimes they bury a magical greatsword in the sands at the centre of the arena. This had been the deciding factor in many arena battles. (Untrue.) PART 3: THE CAVERNS 10 THE HUMAN FACTION This group is called ‘human’, but it may contain members of “civilised” races such as elves, halflings or dwarves; as appropriate to your campaign. The human group consists of eight Human Prisoners, plus their leader Xanthe Jonquil. Human Prisoners are a particularly weak type of NPC, present them as such to the PCs. Maybe they are enslaved peaceful folk (farmers, merchants, scholars) or captured soldiers weakened by hunger and mistreatment. Their thoughts currently do not extend beyond living to see the next day. This faction is initially friendly (DMG244) to the PCs. THE GOBLIN FACTION Fourteen goblin prisoners, plus their leader Jisthelek the Grasping. The goblins are concerned only with survival. They avoid physical confrontation unless they have considerable advantage. They are more of a nuisance, stealing goodies and stirring up fights between other groups. Due to racial affinity they rarely act against the hobgoblins, even though that feeling is not mutual. This faction is initially indifferent (DMG244) to the PCs. THE HOBGOBLIN FACTION Eight hobgoblin prisoners and two bugbear prisoners led by Festan Elf-Cleaver. The hobgoblins are model gladiators; they accept their imprisonment and seek freedom through gaining honour in the arena. While the hobgoblins have a fierce rivalry with the orcs, they would rather see it settled in the arena – or at least in a straight-up fight – rather than in some underhanded manner lacking in honour. This faction is initially unfriendly (DMG244) to the PCs. THE ORC FACTION Six orc prisoners led by the orog Haguur. This group has two desires: to escape, and to slaughter as many of their captors as possible. They consider the hobgoblin prisoners as complicit as the guards, but dare not move against them because of their greater numbers. This faction is initially unfriendly (DMG244) to the PCs. PRISON GUARDS The guards take a fairly hands-off approach to managing the prisoners in the cavern. They believe that there is no way to escape the caverns. Duty of Care. The guards are not held responsible for the occasional prisoner dying in custody. As such, they don’t care if a prisoner is sick, or if a prisoner is starving, or if one prisoner attacks another. They will get in trouble if they don’t prevent mass prisoner deaths (as that is bad for business), so riots and epidemics are investigated. Alerting the Guards. The doors in-between [3F] and the guard room [4A] are iron gates; sound travels easily enough through them. The guards will hear any loud noises and may decide to investigate. Guard Caution. The guards aren’t stupid. They try to evaluate the situation from behind the safety of a locked gate. If they decide to go inside, they go in groups (typically of four), and they ensure that they can call to the guard room for help. While guards do not purposely seek to kill rebellious prisoners they will not hold back against anyone who is a serious threat. Guards entering the prison caverns take a key to open the gate to [3A], but not [4F]. They rely on guards in [4F] to let them back in. Sometimes laziness and overconfidence means this procedure is overlooked if the task seems safe, and the guards will take a key to [3A] and to [4F]. If things seem more dangerous than usual the guards have no qualms about assembling reinforcements. The whole population of guards and/or Drusus Skull-Skewer may be called in for very serious problems. Once assembled, the guards may try to storm the caverns. Prisoner Relations. Hobgoblin guards know the hobgoblin prisoners to be trustworthy, and may even trust them to help in some limited circumstances. They consider the orc prisoners dangerous, but think the human and goblin groups inferior and may underestimate them. Punishment. Typical punishment for wrongdoing is physical violence, from an unarmed blow to the face or gut to a serious beating to near-death. Other possible punishments are work duty (see below), corporal punishment whip-lashings (PHB149) (sometimes in the arena as a pre-match “show”), or by planning unfair arena matches for the troublesome prisoners to partake in. Food and Water. Prisoners only get to eat and drink if there’s enough food for the rest of the Grotto. At the start of the adventure, the prisoners are on full food and water rations. Roll against this table at the start of each day to see how this changes. d20 Result 1-9 Full water. Starting today, the prisoners get full rations of water. Their food provisions are as per the previous day. 10-14 Full food. Starting today, the prisoners get full rations of food. Their water provisions are as per the previous day. 15-16 Limited water. Starting today, the prisoners are now on half water rations. Their food provisions are as per the previous day. 17 No water. Starting today, the prisoners get no water. Their food provisions are as per the previous day. 18-19 Limited food. Starting today, the prisoners are now on half food rations. Their water provisions are as per the previous day. 20 No food. Starting today, the prisoners get no food. Their water provisions are as per the previous day. Thirst or starvation (PHB185) are real concerns. If needed, you should provide one-off exceptions to food and water shortages to prevent certain death. After all, the Gregers PART 3: THE CAVERNS 11 don’t want to lose their money-making arena fighters. The guards distribute food and fresh water daily, assuming there is anything to deliver. They do this at a regular time shortly after sunrise. The food and water comes in large wooden tubs. The guards leave the food in [3A]. Prisoners are expected to return their previous day’s tubs and take the new ones away. The food varies depending on what can be sourced. It is rarely anything nice but it does provide adequate nutrition. No utensils or crockery are provided. Any food not eaten will spoil after a week. Corpse Removal. When a prisoner dies the body is usually taken to [3A] by other prisoners. It is in every prisoner’s interest to not have rotting corpses lying around. Guards collect the body and deposit it in the refuse pit [A4]. Occasionally, corpses will be hidden in [3E]. DRUSUS’ DEMONSTRATION This scripted scene introduces Drusus Skull-Skewer to the PCs and also imparts an important message: that a piecemeal escape plan is probably not a good idea. You should have this scene play very early in the adventure. There’s a commotion going on in the human faction’s cavern. Nine hobgoblin guards have entered into the prison. The hobgoblin leading them stands out, not just because of his immaculate split mail, which glints even in these depths; but his confident manner. There’s also the fact that he holds a bloody, dripping sack in his right hand. He strides forth, leading his small army west into the goblin faction’s cavern. Prisoners flocking to see what’s up dart out of the way rather than obstruct his path. The guards’ leader speaks, addressing the leader of the goblin faction, in their native tongue. “Jisthelek,” he says, “Is this one of yours?” He throws the bloody sack to the goblin leader, who opens it to find a severed goblin head inside. “I remember him being taller,” comes the reply. Many of the prisoners, and even some of the guards, laugh at this gag. Not the guard leader. The guard leader switches to Common, and his gaze wanders to members of the human faction. “That prisoner was found roaming the corridors far from the location of his work duty. For the benefit of you newcomers, the rule is simple. If you escape, or die trying, it will be your kinsmen who receive your punishment.” He motions to his soldiers. They move to block the cavern’s exits. He then selects two guards, ordering them in goblin “You two, one each”. The chosen guards wade into crowd of goblins. The goblins scatter, dodging and diving, but all escapes are blocked by guards. Most of the other prisoners are cheering, some (including the goblin’s leader) even grab at hunted goblins, or trip them, or shove them back. Soon enough, two goblins are dead. The hobgoblin guards and their leader leave as quickly as they arrived, dragging two corpses behind them. The PCs are welcome to intervene in these events. Violent Resistance. If the PCs try to fight the guards, the guards will respond in kind. If the PCs appear to be quite dangerous, Drusus will halt his goblin-killing plans – cancelling the killing order if it had been given – and turn his attention to the troublesome PCs. Drusus knows to have a couple of loyal soldiers at his back when in the company of prisoners. He will not make himself an easy target for assassination. Escape. One guard will carry a key to [3A]. That guard will lock the door behind him. It may be possible to pick-pocket the key, but it would be missed the moment the guards attempted to leave. And Drusus would not lightly tolerate a stolen key. Conversation. Drusus might answer one to two simple questions, but he isn’t really interested in hanging around for a chat. PART 3: THE CAVERNS 12 RANDOM EVENTS Use the below random events to spice up life in the prison. It is suggested that you do four per day – one in the morning, one at noon, one in the afternoon and one for the night. d20 Result 1-3 Work Duty. Guards seek a handful of prisoners to perform a labourious task. (See below for more details.) 4-7 Arena Team Combat. If it is night-time, nothing happens. Otherwise, the guards seek participants from two factions to face one another in the arena. (See below for more details.) 8-10 Arena Beast Combat. If it is night-time, nothing happens. Otherwise, the guards seek participants from one faction to face beasts in the arena. (See below for more details.) 11-13 Arena Training. If it is night-time, nothing happens. Otherwise, the guards allow one faction access to the arena for training. (See below for details.) 14 Prisoner Altercation. Randomly pick two non-player prisoners, even of the same faction. These prisoners quarrel and enter into a violent confrontation. 15 Guard Altercation. As above, but one of the picked characters is a guard. 16 Appropriation. One faction decides to take food or water from another faction. Determine the factions randomly. How the appropriation happens (theft, bargaining, intimidation, force etc) depends on the nature of the factions involved and the general situation in the prison. When food and water are not limited the motive may be greed, otherwise it may be borne of greater necessity. If the human faction is instigating, the PCs are likely to be at least aware of the plan. 17 Rumor. A rumor spreads through the prisoner populations. You might invent a rumour for this, otherwise choose a conversation topic from the table on prisoner interaction further above. 18 Illness. A random prisoner becomes ill. Sewer plague (DMG257) is suitable, but you may use other maladies. If you wish the disease to be communicable, it can spread to anyone in contact unless they pass a DC 5 Constitution check. 19 Guard Incursion. The guards mount an incursion into the prison. If you can, connect this to a recent event. Otherwise, pick a random faction and have the guards search their cavern for contraband. 20 New Blood. d6 new prisoners are thrown into the prison. Randomly determine a faction, or choose one that needs more numbers. They are standard members of that faction and will join that faction by default, though it is possible the PCs could convince them otherwise. WORK DUTY Prisoners are often used for chores around Greger’s Grotto. Prisoner Selection. Since the guards need to escort and supervise the prisoners, they generally pick trustworthy, compliant and willing individuals. Sometimes, though, they will be selective: why not pick the hated prisoners to do a filthy task? For certain tasks, the guards may be instructed to select a certain race. In some cases, they may be instructed to select certain individuals: if the PCs ingratiate themselves as hard workers they may be asked for specifically. Work Detail. Roll against this table to determine what work needs doing: d20 Work Detail Preferred Races Number of Prisoners 1-3 Hauling cargo in the docks [5L]. hobgoblin, human*, orc 2d6 4-5 Scrubbing the deck of a docked ship [5L]. goblin, human* 2d4 6-8 Scrubbing the floor of a room or corridor: [5A], [5C], [5X] or [5Y]. goblin, human* 2d4 9-11 Working in the tavern [5D], either to clean it or as temporary bar staff. human* 1d4 12-13 Entertaining guests in the arena spectator area [5C] e.g. in harmless exhibition matches. hobgoblin, human*, orc 2d4 14-15 Maintaining weapons and equipment in the guard room [4F] or guard barracks [5B]. hobgoblin 1d4 16-17 Picking out bits of detritus from the arena sands [4A]. goblin, human*, orc 2d4 18-20 Spreading refuse across the refuse pit [4E] to accelerate decomposition. goblin, human*, orc 1d4 + 1 * “Human” can include any race from the human faction. Escape Options. While work tasks can be helpful in preparing for an escape, they shouldn’t make escape trivial. In some locations, it’d only take a fast runner or strong swimmer to escape. Avoid letting PCs all work together on such an assignment or the adventure could be over quickly. Attempting to escape is considered extreme disobedience. Punishment is severe. If an escapee gets away or is killed in the attempt then heavy punishment will be meted out to the prisoner’s faction. Prisoner Supervision. Usually there is one guard for each prisoner. This number can vary if the guards trust or distrust the prisoners in question. The guards may use leg-chains to keep prisoners from escaping. These chains halve the speed of anyone wearing them, and otherwise are as per manacles (PHB152). In some cases the guards may even chain the manacles together, meaning no prisoner may move more than 20 feet from her “neighbours” along the chain. The guards keep track of what prisoners they take out for work duty. If any prisoners go missing the guards will likely notice it as they muster the prisoners at the end of the work shift. Meeting NPCs. A work shift is an excellent opportunity for the PCs to meet some of the named NPCs in Appendix A. For example, if sent to haul cargo in the docks, they may be working under the orders of Gladwin Greger or Harry Dodds. PART 3: THE CAVERNS 13 ARENA EVENTS Here are details regarding events where guards seek participants for the arena. Chosen Factions. The guards know to select prisoners down factional lines, as any attempt to mix teams would likely result in bloodshed before getting to the arena sands. The guards are instructed on what factions to select ahead of time. As DM you can the pick factions purposefully or just randomly. Volunteer Basis. The guards allow chosen factions to put forward their own members. If no members volunteer, the guards pick individuals. This could be an interesting test of the PCs’ heroism (or otherwise). The orc and hobgoblin factions almost always have members volunteering, the human faction often does, the goblin faction rarely does. Quantity (Combat). For non-training events, the guards seek groups of the following size to represent each faction. d20 Group Size 1-2 Solo. One person. 3-8 Small. Randomly determined: at least two, at most the number of PCs minus one. (If there are less than three PCs, ignore this entry and reroll.) 9-15 Perfect. The same as the number of PCs. 16-19 Large. d4 multiplied by the number of PCs. 20 Everyone. Take all members of a faction. Quantity (Training). Any number of prisoners from the selected faction can volunteer to participate in training. Usually everyone goes – even injured or frail members can at least get some fresh air. Fairness. The guards are usually instructed to pick prisoners to make a fair fight. If – in their estimation – the balance seems unfair they will make adjustments. Spectators. The guards may take a few extra prisoners to watch the fight from the arena sidelines or from behind the gates to the ready rooms. They will not do this for untrustworthy prisoners. Any attempt by spectators to influence the fight will be punished. Arena Combat. If the PCs are involved in the combat then you need to enact it. See Part 4 for details. Casualties. If the PCs are not involved in the combat then you needn’t run the combat round-by-round. If you wish, you can simulate injuries from the battle. Roll per-combatant on the below table. d20 Injuries 1 Dead. The combatant died. Their body is taken to the refuse pit [4E]. 2-3 Critically Injured. The combatant fell to zero hit points, but was stabilised (PHB197). 4-10 Injured. The combatant suffered some damage. Inflict d4 damage per the combatant’s hit die total; this cannot leave the combatant with less than one hit point. 11-20 Uninjured. The combatant lost no hit points. 3A. HUMAN CAVERN This cavern is the area claimed by the human prisoners (or, more accurately, it is the only sunlit cavern not claimed by other groups). This natural cavern is about forty feet from wall to wall. Beams of sunlight shine in through gratings far overhead, well over one hundred feet up. The floor is covered in a fine sand. In centre of the cavern is a large, deep pool of water. You’re not alone in here. A small group of prisoners, mostly human, stare at you. One of their number, an older woman, extends her arms and says, “Welcome!” On entering the cavern for the first time, the PCs are welcomed by Xanthe Jonquil. Light. This cavern is brightly lit at or around noon, when the sun can shine directly down through the cavern. At any other time during the day it is dimly lit. At night it is in darkness. (PHB183). Door. The door leading toward the guard room [A4] is an iron gate. Sound and most ranged attacks can travel easily through it. It is extremely sturdy, requiring a DC35 Strength check to break. The lock can be picked with a DC 12 Dexterity check and a set of thieves’ tools. Climbing. The ceiling is 140ft. overhead. Climbing is obviously hazardous, becoming progressively more difficult as the overhang increases and the rocks become smoother from years of exposure to rainwater. Any climbing of the first forty feet requires a DC8 Strength (Athletics) check. Any climbing of the next fifty is DC14. The final fifty feet is DC18. Failure by more than 5 means the PC falls (PHB183) some random point between the start and end of that section of climbing. Ceiling Grates. Exit to the surface is barred by strong metal grates, fixed in place. Each bar as as thick as a man’s arm; the gap between each bar is about the same width. A successful DC40 Strength check is needed to break or bends the bars. Characters who fail to bend or break the bars while climbing must take a DC10 Strength (Athletics) check not to fall. The grates have an AC of 19, 18 hit points and a damage threshold of 10 (DMG246). They are immune to cold, fire, lightning, piercing, poison, psychic and radiant damage and resistant to bludgeoning, force, necrotic, slashing and thunder damage. That said, it’s fair that you consider them impervious to anything low-level PCs could possibly do, and simply state as such. If a PC can bypass the bars they will end up outdoors (see part 5). PART 3: THE CAVERNS 14 THE WATER This cavern has a pool of water around thirty feet deep. Not potable. The pool is sea water. Drinking a few sips is harmless but any significant amount is a bad idea. The amount drunk subtracts from the PC’s daily water intake rather than adding to it (PHB185). In addition, a PC that imbibes a large amount of water may be immediately required to take a Constitution check or immediately suffer one level of exhaustion (PHB291); the DC being 5 per cup-full of water. Exploring. The PCs may be tempted to explore the pool’s depths. There is nothing to find in this particular pool – but don’t tell them that! Exploring the pool requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check against DC10. If that succeeds they may make a Wisdom (Perception) check; at disadvantage unless they have a light source with them. (Lights from above the pool don’t pierce the murky depths.) Only if they succeed against DC30 should players be told they’ve made a comprehensive search of the pool. You may reduce the DC of Wisdom (Perception) checks by 2 per attempt if the PCs communicate and collaborate about where they have and haven’t searched. A PC may make as many Strength (Athletics) checks for exploring in pools equal to 1 + his Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). A short rest, or an extended period away from the pools, resets this limit. 3B. GOBLIN CAVERN This cavern is claimed by the goblin prisoners. Light and Climbing. This cavern has openings in the ceiling like [3A]. The same rules for light and climbing apply. The Water. The cavern has a pool like [3A]. The same rules for exploring it apply here. There is, however, something in this pool. A short sword (PHB149) lies at the bottom, lost during a past skirmish between guards and prisoners. Finding it requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. It is has been corroded by the seawater, and will break if it rolls minimum damage. (Whether you tell the players this or track it yourself is up to you.) 3C. ORC CAVERN This cavern is claimed by the orc prisoners. The Water. The cavern has a pool like [3A]. The same rules for exploring it apply here. This pool hides two secrets. On a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check the PCs will discover an underwater tunnel that leads to the south. See further below for how this tunnel is traversed. There’s also a bag of caltrops (PHB151), smuggled in from the arena and hidden but forgotten about. Its discovery is DC 10. The caltrops are corroded but this doesn’t impact their effectiveness (but it might limit their re-usability). UNDERWATER TUNNEL Once the tunnel has been discovered (see above) it can be traversed. The tunnel is 80 feet long (the PCs won’t know this until they traverse it). Its is mostly 10 feet wide, occasionally narrowing it to 5 feet. It leads to the pool in [3 J]. Because it twists and meanders and is entirely underwater it is considered difficult terrain (PHB182). Swimming (PHB182) is done on a round-by-round basis; a PC may only move in a round if they succeed at a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, otherwise they make no progress. If the PCs desire to stick together you may wish to perform this as a group check (PHB175). The tunnel is in darkness; it is possible to grope along without seeing but doing so imposes a disadvantage to the Strength (Athletics) checks. PCs who take a long time to traverse the tunnel run the risk of suffocating (PHB183). Remember, there are ten rounds to the minute (PHB181). A PC who has successfully traversed a tunnel no longer considers that tunnel difficult terrain as they now know what to expect. 3D. HOBGOBLIN CAVERN This cavern is claimed by the hobgoblin prisoners. The Water. The cavern has a pool like [3A]. The same rules for exploring it apply here. This pool hides a secret. If the Wisdom (Perception) check reaches a DC of 10 the PCs will discover an underwater tunnel that leads to the south. Traversing this tunnel uses the same rules as the tunnel in [3C], except this tunnel is 120 feet long and it exits in [3K]. PART 3: THE CAVERNS 15 ANNEX CAVERNS Areas [3E], [3F], [3G] and [3H]. The fact that these caverns exist is known to many prisoners, and some make use of them when seeking privacy. Few, however, have explored very far. 3E. FIRST EMPTY CAVERN This ceiling of this cavern is low, as low as 5 feet in some cases, and in many places narrowing into niches only a few feet across. It is not inhabited but instead seems to be used as a makeshift graveyard and refuse pile. At first glance there’s nothing useful amongst the detritus on the floor: scraps of cloth, tiny fragments of leather and wood. Even the larger bones of dead prisoners have been plundered. Anything that could make a primitive club or shiv has long ago been removed. This chamber is devoid of anything useful. Hidden Tunnel. One of the niches at the cavern edge, as marked on the map, actually leads through to [3F] via a short cramped tunnel. It can be found with a DC15 Wisdom (Perception) check, or a PC declaring they are inspecting the niches. 3F. SECOND EMPTY CAVERN Another irregular cavern. This one does not have refuse and bones. Like the previous cavern, it has several natural alcoves along its wall. Tucked into a corner of this chamber (but noticeable with a cursory inspection of the room) is a sack. Inside the sack are two makeshift but perfectly serviceable slings, a pouch containing 20 sling stones, and two sets of unlocked manacles without keys (PHB149-150). This is stash belongs to Jisthelek the Grasping, who will not be happy if he sees the PCs with it. Hidden Tunnel. There are two more hidden tunnels in this room. Like before, they can be found with a DC15 Wisdom (Perception) checks, or by a PC declaring they are inspecting the niches. 3G. SPIDER CAVERN This chamber, too, is characterised by a number of natural niches along its walls. Most of these alcoves are thick with spider-web, some even appear to have humanoid-shaped lumps cocooned inside. The cavern’s ceiling starts off low, but rapidly ascends ahead of you. The ceiling on the far side of the cave is high enough to be indiscernible through the gloom. Webs. The map area coloured in white is thick with webs (DMG105). Ceiling Cavity. The cavern’s roof is highest at the south- western end of the cavern, above the webbed area. It is 100 feet high, and filled with webs all the way up. Few light sources will penetrate that far. Climbing up requires a DC10 Strength (Athletics) check, remember to consider the slowing effect of the webs. Falling is not a danger because of the webs. There are some more cocoons up in the ceiling cavity, and possibly a spider too (see below for both). SPIDER LAIR This cave is obviously a spider lair, but whether it is active or not is up to you. Dead Giant Spider. In this scenario, the lair is now empty; the giant spider that once dwelt here has starved from a lack of curious (or stupid) prisoners. At an opportune moment, such as when the PCs approach the cave rear or start searching the cocoons, have the spider’s dried-up corpse fall on an unsuspecting PC: Something leaps down from the ceiling! Something big, hairy and multi-legged! Have the unlucky PC take a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being “captured”, allow the PC to pass to matter how abysmal the roll. Then start combat. The dead spider, of course, does nothing in its turn. It has an AC of 10. Technically it should be unconscious (PHB292) but this might alert savvy players to your trick. Eventually the PCs will stop to wonder why the spider is doing nothing. Anyone asking to examine the spider should be told it is not moving, and lying collapsed on the floor. Living Spider(s). The cavern is home to a giant wolf spider (MM330) or a giant spider (MM328). Or several of either. Or, it could be home to one or more swarms of spiders (MM338); either on their own or with the PART 3: THE CAVERNS 16 aforementioned giants (the swarms being the “babies” of the giants). When choosing what spiders to include, consider the difficulty of the encounter (DMG82). Too many spiders may be impossible for the PCs to defeat! Here are some suggestions for hard encounters: • Four PCs at level 1: one giant spider; or two swarms of spiders (MM338); or three giant wolf spiders. • Four PCs at level 2: three giant wolf spiders and two swarms of spiders; or two giant spiders. • Four PCs at level 3: one giant spider plus three swarms of spiders; or eight giant wolf spiders. Any spiders living in the cavern will hide in the ceiling cavity. They will retaliate if attacked, or if the PCs linger; their aggressiveness otherwise is up to you. If you choose to make the spiders aggressive, consider making use of their Stealth skills. COCOONS The cocoons are the desiccated remains of the spider’s prey. Equipment caught in these cocoons has survived the ravages of time quite well. There are eight cocoons; five in niches around the cavern’s edges and three up in the ceiling cavity; at heights of 20, 40 and 60 feet. Determine which cocoons hold what loot randomly. The first four cocoons hold nothing of use, just bones of long-dead prisoners. Cocoon five entombs a hobgoblin guard; it contains a set of studded leather armour (PHB145), a short sword, a dagger (PHB149), and coin as per Individual Treasure Challenge 0-4 (DMG136). Cocoon six holds a dead goblin prisoner that had considerable smuggling success; it contains a set of thieves’ tools (PHB154) and a tinderbox (PHB153). Cocoon seven contains the corpse of a human pirate who wandered into these caverns well before prisoners were kept here. It contains a rapier (PHB149), three torches, a spyglass (PHB153), and coin as per Individual Treasure Challenge 0-4 (two rolls) (DMG136). Cocoon eight holds a dwarf prisoner, one that tried to escape during excavation duties. Inside is a shovel and a miner’s pick (PHB150). Swarming Surprise. If you are feeling cruel, you may wish to put swarms of spiders into one or several of the cocoons. If you are feeling very cruel you may wish to trigger a spider attack (living or dead, see above) at the moment such a swarm is released. 3H. BURROWS One of the cavern’s natural alcoves has been intersected by a tunnel. The tunnel goes off in two directions. It’s very cramped: even a halfling would have to crawl to squeeze through. The smooth, round edges of the tunnel suggest it was left by some burrowing creature. The tunnel is Tiny sized. Medium-sized creatures cannot fit; Small-sized creatures can squeeze in (PHB191) by crawling (PHB182) down the tunnel. GUARD ROOM WALL The burrow’s north-western end terminates at the wall of [4F] the guard room. Dozens of years ago giant fire beetles burrowed into the guard room. A heavy-duty brick wall was put in place to seal it off. That event has long been forgotten and the current guards have no knowledge of the burrow. They consider the bricked-up wall as just one of many bits of rough cosmetic work that can be found around the Grotto. Eavesdropping. Gaps between the brick wall allow sound to travel both ways. Loud sounds travel well, but it’s hard to make out quieter details. Listening to conversations or other quieter sounds requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. A PC can chip away at the mortar between the bricks to clearly hear and even have a limited view into the guard room. Doing so requires some kind of tool suitable for the job, and perhaps a Dexterity (Stealth) check to ensure the guards don’t notice the noise. Once cleared, listening no longer requires a skill check and a limited arc of view is possible. On the flip side, any noises from the tunnel are easily heard inside the guard room. Guard Suspicion. If the guards suspect there’s something behind the wall, they may attempt one of two actions. If they are unsure of what’s causing the noise, they may smash down the wall to investigate. When they discover a burrow, they will arrange to have it bricked up more solidly. If they have reason to suspect humanoid activity (such as hearing tool use or someone talking), they may mount an excursion into the prisoner area to search for the tunnel. If they can find it, they’ll arrange to brick it up more thoroughly, and in the mean-time they’ll know to watch it carefully. BEETLE BURROWS The tunnel branches and leads in various directions as shown on the map. Dead Ends. The tunnels don’t end where shown on the map, but they do shrink such that only Tiny creatures could squeeze in (PHB191). If the constrictions don’t stop the PCs, have the tunnels continue for a few hundred more feet before terminating in a collapse. The fairly hard rock walls of the burrows has given way to looser gravel-like material. As you crawl on, you start to notice voids above you, places where the ceiling has collapsed in the past. Sure enough, up ahead the burrow ends in a tunnel collapse. It seems likely that the burrowing creatures will dig through again, as they apparently have done in the past, though you’ve no idea whether their return will be in minutes or months. PART 3: THE CAVERNS 17 At your discretion the tunnel to the south could meander for 1,600 (3d10 x 100) feet before exiting somewhere along [3Q]. Beetle Activity. At your discretion, you may have Giant Fire Beetles (MM325) navigate the burrows. (Although these are Small creatures, allow them to navigate their own burrows as if they were Tiny creatures.) The beetles aren’t necessarily hostile, but if they do attack the resulting combat in a confined space could be very difficult for PCs. The glowing beetle glands might be useful for the PCs. If your PCs are having trouble with illumination, you may want to be liberal with the beetles, even having them venture outside their burrows. HAUNTED CAVERNS Areas [3 J] through to [3R]. These natural caverns are unknown to all living members of Greger’s Grotto. Many years ago, when Greger’s Grotto was first being established, captured dwarves were used to dig out corridors and living areas to augment the natural caves. Eventually, these dwarves mounted an escape. Their plan was to hide out in these caverns – which their captors did not know about – while they dug to the surface. Unfortunately, their escape took them through a seam of coal. The leader knew the risks, but pushed on, unwilling to start a new tunnel with provisions dwindling. This turned out to be the wrong choice. Noxious gases released by the seam polluted the caverns and poisoned most of the group. Those few that remained, driven desperate by the fumes, quarrelled with their leader. This escalated into a fight in which the leader slew the would-be “mutineers”. Distraught to the point of inaction, the leader succumbed to the deadly gas a few hours later. Traumatised by this bloodshed and his general failure, the leader of these escapees haunts the caverns as a ghost. Even though this is a lesser form of ghost than the one found in the Monster Manual (MM147), it is still a tough encounter for low-level PCs with limited equipment. Attacking it would be dangerous. Clever PCs will avoid or outwit the ghost while they explore these caverns. THE GHOST These caverns are haunted by a Dwarf Ghost. He is the confused type of ghost, believing he and his band are still alive and at work on the tunnel. See the ghost’s stat block for more details. Movement. The ghost moves around the caverns, believing himself to be on various errands and duties that occupied him during the last days of his life. The nature of his unfinished business means he cannot leave the area; he must remain in in the rooms [3 J] to [3R], excluding [3Q]. Randomly determine the ghost’s starting position, then every so often (about once every 15 minutes; whenever it is convenient for you) move him randomly by rolling against the below: d20 Result 1-5 The ghost lingers where it is. 6-10 The ghost moves to a random adjacent room. 11-13 The ghost moves one room closer to [3L]. If it is already there it lingers. 13-16 The ghost moves one room closer to [3M]. If it is already there it lingers. 17-20 The ghost moves one room closer to [3R]. If it is already there it lingers. 3 J. WESTERN POOL CAVERN This cavern is unremarkable save for the watery pool it contains. The Water. The cavern has a pool like [3A]. The same rules for exploring it apply here. The only thing of interest in this pool is an underwater tunnel leading to [3C]. This tunnel requires a successful DC10 Wisdom (Perception) check to discover. (Any tunnel the PCs entered by is automatically discovered.) Consult [3C] for information about traversing the tunnel. 3K. EASTERN POOL CAVERN This cavern is unremarkable save for the watery pool it contains. The Water. The cavern has a pool like [3A]. The same rules for exploring it apply here. The only thing of interest in this pool is an underwater tunnel leading to [3D]. This tunnel requires a successful DC10 Wisdom (Perception) check to discover. (Any tunnel the PCs entered by is automatically discovered.) Consult [3D] for information about traversing the tunnel. 3L. EMPTY CAVERN There is nothing special about this cavern. Metagame Bluff. You may wish to use this cavern to subvert your players’ metagame thinking (DMG235). Every time they pass through this cavern do something suspicious; have them take meaningless Perception checks or secretly roll some dice. PART 3: THE CAVERNS 18 3M. MINING CAMP The dwarf escapees set up here while they dug the tunnel. It’s also where the attempted mutiny took place. Years later, their camp remains mostly intact. This cavern looks to have been a camp site. You see a few extinguished cooking fires, a half-dozen unfurled sleeping mats, and small piles of provisions and equipment. There are skeletal corpses of dwarves here. One lays curled up on a sleeping mat. Another is slumped against a wall, a mining pick lodged into its skull, the blow right between the eyes. The pick’s handle is banded with loops of twine. An iron crowbar lies on the floor by this corpse’s hand. The third and final corpse lays face-down on the floor in an awkward pose, a flat-headed shovel still gripped in its bony fingers. A layer of dust and filth coats everything here; it is apparent that this room has not been disturbed for many years. Equipment. Much of the camp site has decayed or been ruined by vermin, including the food, the bedrolls, clothing and cloth and some leather containers. The following items are in serviceable condition and can be scavenged: two light hammers, one warhammer, one warpick (PHB149), ten candles, one crowbar, two hammers, one mess kit, seven miner’s picks, three flasks of oil, one iron pot, one hempen rope (50 feet), three shovels, 20 iron spikes, two tinderboxes, seven empty waterskins, one whetstone (PHB150) and one herbalism kit (PHB154). 3P. OCEAN POOL CAVERN Like many of the caverns you have seen before, this one has a pool in its centre. Movement draws your eyes to the water’s surface. Small fish dart about in the pool. The previous pools had been devoid of animal life. Bones of medium-sized fish lie scattered around the pool’s edge, picked totally clean. The Water. The cavern has a pool like [3A]. The same rules for exploring it apply here. This pool hides a secret. If the Wisdom (Perception) check reaches a DC of 10 the PCs will discover an underwater tunnel that leads to the west. Traversing this tunnel uses the same rules as the tunnel in [3C], except this tunnel is a considerable 400 feet long and it exits somewhere underwater in Greger’s Grotto [5L]. Crabs. Sometimes, Giant Crabs (MM342) lurk here consuming the fish they have scavenged or caught. There are d12 – 8 giant crabs present. The crabs are not aggressive. If attacked or startled, they will retaliate or retreat. As they’re not social animals, they don’t necessarily work together: one crab may stand idly by another is killed. Giant crabs contain a considerable amount of meat: 20 rations’ worth each (PHB185). A successful Wisdom (Survival) check at DC 10 made while harvesting the meat ensures that it won’t be dangerous to eat (see below), though the amount of rations is reduced by 5. The meat goes bad after one day, or one week if cooked. Crab meat may be infected with marine parasites: anyone eating uncooked crab meat must pass a DC5 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease similar to Sewer Plague (DMG247), but non-communicable. Foraging. Since this pool connects to the ocean, it contains sea life. PCs can try foraging as per DMG111. The DC is 15. It is assumed the PCs have something to use as bait – even minuscule scraps from their own food supply will do, if PART 3: THE CAVERNS 19 not the Survival check has disadvantage. Note that only food can be foraged from this pool, not fresh water. Tunnel Lurker. The first PC to reach d6 x 50 feet into the tunnel will encounter a Giant Octopus (MM326). Up ahead you see a shape move. It’s big; about the size of a horse. You catch a glimpse of tentacles. Whatever it is, it darts back and forth in the dark tunnel ahead of you before disappearing from sight. If the PCs press on regardless, the octopus will attack. Consider using its Stealth skill and Underwater Camouflage to surprise the PCs (DMG189) and attack unseen (DMG194). If it loses more than half of its hit points it will attempt to retreat, using its Ink Cloud action. Remember, this is underwater combat (DMG198). 3N. ESCAPE TUNNEL This is the dwarves’ attempt at an escape tunnel. It is a dead end – it was never finished. You stand at the entrance to a long, narrow tunnel. It’s clearly artificial. It slopes upwards at an incline and its ceiling is low enough that a human would have to stoop. The walls of this tunnel contain thick seams of sooty coal, and thinner seams of gleaming gold. Indeed, chunks of gold litter the floor. Knowledge. There are certain facts about this tunnel that a PC may know. These are all Intelligence (Nature) checks. Dwarf PCs double their proficiency bonus (PHB173). You may wish to perform these as passive checks (PHB175), so as not to alert the players. If PCs explicitly examine the tunnel or ask pertinent questions, you may allow them to roll for some or all of the facts. DC Read to Players 12 The golden material is pyrite, also known as fool’s gold. Though pretty it is essentially worthless. 14 Coal seams like this often release dangerous gases, especially when disturbed. 16 Jet is a valuable gemstone commonly found in coal seams like this. Uncut jet is difficult to distinguish from the coal that surrounds it, but you know what to look for. Minerals. The tunnel cuts through an extensive seam of coal. Coal litters the floor in copious amounts should the PCs want to take any. PCs scavenging along the tunnel floor can find 3d6 nuggets of pyrite, each weighing ½lb. If they know to look, they can also find d4 jet gemstones (DMG134). PCs equipped with mining picks can dig for more with a DC10 Strength check. The check takes half an hour. If the PC was digging for pyrite, they find one nugget, plus one nugget per 2 by which they exceeded the DC. If the PC was digging for jet, they have a 5% chance of finding a jet gemstone, plus 5% per 2 by which they exceeded the DC. Extending the Tunnel. The tunnel is only a fraction of the length needed to reach the surface. The PCs cannot realistically complete it, though they don’t necessarily know this. The tunnel increases in length by 1 foot per person-hour of digging. At your discretion, excessive digging may cause exhaustion (PHB291). Noxious Gas. Digging for gems or to extend the tunnel may release noxious gases. After every half-hour period during which one or many PC were digging, roll a d20: d20 Noxious Gas 1-2 Flammable gas builds up. PCs in the tunnel passing a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check will notice a “rotten egg” smell some minutes before the gas reaches dangerous levels. Once at dangerous levels, any open flame will cause the gas to combust causing 3d6 fire damage. All characters in the tunnel are damaged. A DC12 Dexterity saving throw will halve the damage taken. Ignition clears the gas build-up. Otherwise, it will dissipate after one hour. 3-10 Odourless poisonous gases build up. Anyone in the tunnel must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 poison damage and become poisoned (PHB292) for one hour. The DC is 15 for characters in the tunnel, 10 for characters in the mining camp [3M], or 5 for characters in [3J], [3K], [3L], [3P] or [3R]. 11-20 No gases are released. 3R. MAKESHIFT MORGUE This cavern was used as a makeshift morgue by the dwarves, while they still had the strength to attend to such arrangements. Five short humanoid bodies have been neatly laid out side-by-side in this cavern. Each body is covered, either with a decayed remains of a blanket or threadbare lengths of sackcloth. Equipment. The bodies have been stripped of useful gear and the clothes they once wore have decayed beyond usefulness. Anyone searching may make successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to find a folded silk handkerchief hidden away in one of the corpses’ clothes. The handkerchief contains five tiny rubies, worth 25 GP each. Metagame Bluff. You may wish to use this cavern to subvert your players’ metagame thinking (DMG235). As they move towards or otherwise interact with the bodies do something suspicious; have them take meaningless Wisdom (Perception) checks or secretly roll some dice. PART 3: THE CAVERNS 20 3Q. NATURAL TUNNEL Even in the fantasy world, sometimes a natural cavern goes nowhere and contains nothing. This area is exactly that – a long tunnel that terminates in a large cavern, going nowhere and containing nothing useful; of interest only to spelunkers. This area could distract exploration-hungry PCs, and possibly serve to dislodge metagame thinking (DMG235) that everything has a purpose. If the idea of a pointless tunnel doesn’t appeal to you, simply erase it from your adventure. This tunnel is clearly natural, as no sane architect would make something so awkward. To navigate it you are constantly squeezing through narrow gaps, clambering up or down gradients or ledges. It twists and turns in on itself, its width and height is erratic, though it does feel like it descending overall. Now and then it appears as to branch into alternate routes, but on inspection these end abruptly in rocky blockages or shrink down into tunnels or gaps far too small to fit into. Indeed, it seems that your path is actually a series of different tunnels and caverns linked together. Navigation. Though the tunnel is awkward to navigate, no feature of it is so difficult as to require skill checks. Tiny Tunnel. If one or more of your PCs are of Small size, you may wish to decree that the tunnel shrinks to Tiny size (PHB191). Small characters may pass, but Medium characters cannot (PHB192). On the downside, this may split the party. On the up side, it may increase tension as an individual or small group venture into the unknown. Extra Exit. At some point along the tunnel there may be an exit to the burrows [3H]. See that room for more information. The exit, if it exists, is only seen with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Metagame Bluff. You may wish to describe the tunnel’s path and its various short dead-end offshoots in detail. You could also describe various rock formations. None of these details are of any consequence, they are merely red herrings. You might also over-dramatise difficult points in the tunnel, such as crawling or squeezing through a smaller space (PHB182, PHB192). Ask them exactly what order they go in, and who is holding the light source. They may go to extraordinary lengths avoid an ambush that isn’t going to happen. CREVASSE CAVERN After a few hundred feet, the tunnel opens into a large cavern. The tunnel opens up into a large cavern. It’s a huge underground fissure, or crevasse, and you stand on a wide ledge on its wall. The void extends to the left and right, up and down, swallowed by darkness. Across from you ledge is another ledge, with a twenty-foot gap in- between. It appears the tunnel continues onward on the other side The Crevasse. Is about twenty feet wide, two hundred feet tall and three hundred feet wide. The two ledges are approximately in the middle of the crevasse walls. It is wholly underground – there is no opening to the surface at the top. The bottom is difficult terrain (PHB182). Climbing up or down the walls below the ledge requires a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check (PHB182). The DC increases to 20 when climbing the walls above the ledge, as this would necessitate climbing an overhang. PCs may consider jumping across the gap (PHB182). Falling would almost certainly be lethal (PHB193). Glowing Moss. From the ledge, a PC may notice a faint glow at one of the bottom corners of the crevasse. In darkness, this glow is obvious. If a light source is present, a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check is needed. Something is faintly glowing somewhere down in the fissure; about one hundred feet below you and about as much along the wall itself. You can’t see what’s causing the glow The glow is caused by some bio-luminescent moss. The moss neither useful nor nutritious nor harmful in any way; but don’t tell the players that. If removed from the wall, it will stop glowing within minutes. Tucked away in a small fold at the end of the crevasse is a small pocket of life. Unlike most of the fissure, the walls here are damp, and support a softly glowing yellow moss. Tiny pale insects, barely the size of a grain of rice, crawl lazily over the soft beds of moss. The Other Side. A tunnel continues from the ledge on the other side. It is similar to the tunnel the PCs entered with. After a few hundred feet it terminates in a dead end. Though, at your discretion, it could connect to the burrows [3H]; see that room for more information. PART 3: THE CAVERNS 21 PART 4: THE ARENA loodsport, like any other sport, can be commercialised. The operators of Greger Grotto don’t run an arena because they personally enjoy it. They run it because it lures visitors. Instead of stopping only for trade or repairs privateers will visit just to be entertained. More visitors, more money. B ARENA BATTLES Arena battles are organised when there are enough interested visitors to warrant it. There can be up to three events per day; purposefully spaced apart to encourage visitors to stay and spend money. There are two main types of battles: battles between teams of prisoners, and battles where a team of prisoners face off against beasts. The PCs are summoned to arena fights from the prisoner caverns. Part 3 has rules about when and how the PCs may be summoned. GENERAL RULES Even the most lethal of bloodsports has rules. Defer to the Editor. The Editor is the person running the arena on that day. Combatants are expected to heed the editor’s instructions. Starting. The combatants take up positions near the edges of the arena, opposite the enemy team. They are expected to listen to any special instructions from the editor, and wait for her order to commence. Surrender. Raising one’s hand with an open palm is a sign of surrender. Killing Blows. It is expected that a combatant will seek permission from the Editor before killing a clearly defeated foe, or a foe that has surrendered. The Editor will gauge the crowd’s reaction and give the order. Refusing to kill an enemy when ordered constitutes disobedience. Killing an opponent while they are an active threat is perfectly allowed. Some combatants will purposely knock out their foes (PHB198), but this is not expected. These rules apply to prisoners only. Animals and monsters can kill – and be killed – without consequence. Guards will not save a downed prisoner from an animal or monster. Pacifism. Refusal to fight is only a problem if all combatants do it, or if some combatants are so good at avoiding combat (through mundane or magical means) that it spoils the fight. Problematic pacifism is considered disobedience. Magic Use. Magic is permitted in the arena. PART 4: THE ARENA 22 Escape. Attempting to prematurely leave the arena or move upwards towards the spectator level is considered disobedience. Crowd Endangerment. Attacking the crowd is a severe form of disobedience. The editor may order the death of any combatant that displays an extremely dangerous attack (such as a fireball spell), even if that attack is only used on other arena combatants. Disobedience. The editor will rebuke mild disobedience, especially for combatants new to the arena and unfamiliar with the rules. More serious offences will warrant beatings from the guards carried out in the arena. Grave disobedience, such as attacking the crowd, will result in immediate lethal retaliation by guards; both by archers in the stands and guards nearer the arena floor. LOGISTICS A lot must be done behind-the-scenes to stage an arena battle. Here are the tasks, in order. Instructions. Word is sent to the guard room [4F] as to the type of battle to be undertaken along with any special instructions. Preparation Rooms. Guards take weapons and other equipment from the guard room [4F] to the various preparation rooms [4B], [4C] and/or [4D]. DEFAULT PREPARATION ROOM EQUIPMENT This is the default equipment that PCs will find in a preparation room: d4 daggers, d4 maces, d4-1 nets, d4 shields, d4 shortswords, d4 spears, d4 scimitars, d4-1 whips (PHB149). There is an assortment of arcane foci, druidic foci and holy symbols (PHB150); any spell-casting character will be able to find something that suits them. Generally you needn’t worry about what NPC prisoners might have in their preparation rooms, use what they have in their stat blocks. If the players complain that the other teams are getting different equipment that’s fine; the arena isn’t always fair! Just be mindful that NPC equipment doesn’t contravene battle variant rules (see below). Wrangle Creatures. Some fights pit prisoners against animals or monsters. The guards, usually assisted by the traffickers that previously owned the animals, put these creatures into preparation rooms [4B], [4C] and/or [4D]. If the creatures aren’t aggressive enough to enter the arena on their own some guards may remain behind to shoo them into the arena when the battle starts. Collect Prisoners. The prisoners are collected and taken to preparation rooms. See Part 3 for more information about this. Open the Gates. On the editor’s orders, the gates are opened via winch systems in the spectator’s area [5C]. Combatants are expected to sally forth onto the arena; the guards will forcibly motivate anyone that refuses. Combat. The editor may make a few remarks then will order the combat begin. Gates are closed during combat. Combat lasts for as long as it lasts. Prisoner Return. After combat is over, the gates are once again opened. Prisoners are expected to return to their preparation room, where they will await guards to escort them back to their caverns. Prisoners are not permitted to take any equipment back with them. The guards watch for smuggling attempts. Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks (PHB177) might help conceal an item. There is a special allowance for spellbooks – it is known these are required to prepare spells. The arena organisers want to encourage magic in the arena as it excites the crowd. No treatment is offered to prisoners. Prisoners are expected to carry incapacitated allies, but the guards will begrudgingly help if required. Prisoners are not supposed to carry corpses back to their caverns, though guards have little reason to check every limp body for life signs. Remove Creatures. Monsters and animals still in the arena will be re-captured if they’re relatively uninjured and/or expensive. Otherwise they will be killed. Final Cleanup. Corpses will be taken to the refuse pit [A3], as will any equipment that is beyond repair. Usable equipment is returned to the guard room [A4]. The arena is left clean, though the guards are not thorough enough to wash away the blood or tiny scraps of equipment. PART 4: THE ARENA 23 THE EDITOR The editor is always someone from the Greger family. Each individual has a different style, as detailed in their stat block in Appendix A. The same editor usually oversees all arena battles on a given day. Roll to determine: d20 Editor 1-5 Gertrude Greger 6-10 Gillian Greger 11-15 Glawdin Greger 16-20 Godrick Greger THE CROWD The arena exists to entertain the crowd. While the editor may technically run the games, she would be a fool to defy the favour of the crowd. Happy customers are returning customers. Crowd Desires. The crowd wants drama, blood and displays of skill. Deficit of one can be forgiven if there is surplus of another. Fickle. The crowd is fickle. Its mood and its loyalties change constantly. Novelty is favoured more than consistency. Factional. The crowd has its favourites, often picked down racial lines (human spectators generally favour human combatants, for example). When favourites compete it energises the crowd. In extreme situations it may lead to riots. Surrender. As a general rule, the crowd will accept surrender. They will not accept it when they feel the combatant has been cowardly or displayed a lack of skill. Happy crowds are more forgiving than unhappy ones. Avoiding Punishment. Combatants can get away with bending or breaking the rules if they please the crowd in doing so. Sensible editors do not seek punishment in such situations. At least not publicly. Interaction. The PCs can curry favour with the crowd by being interesting. They might show off with fancy moves or take exciting risks. They might engage in grandiose banter, especially by way of Charisma (Performance) checks. There are quite a few regular spectators so it is possible to build a reputation. NPCs might also attempt to win the crowd over in these ways, sometimes cynically, sometimes out of a genuine love of performance or of the arena. BATTLE VARIANTS The table on the next page can be used to randomly determine battle variants. BATTLE DIFFICULTY The PCs should find arena combat fairly easy. After all, adventuring parties typically have six to eight combat encounters per day (DMG84). If you use the arena guidelines as written in this part they will fall well below this quota. Does it matter? In some cases, no. The PCs are lacking in equipment (especially armour). And if anyone deserves a bit of a break it’s low level characters. That said, if you want to increase difficulty, consider these options. You might imply that the added difficulty is standard procedure in the arena, or you could attribute it to a bloodthirsty or vindictive editor or crowd. Quantity. Add more enemies per encounter. This increases the encounter difficulty (DMG82). Waves. Add more encounters. If the PCs beat a group of prisoners or beasts simply send in another. You could allow a few minutes’ respite between waves: this is not only logistically realistic but allows the PCs a few moments to use abilities and get organised. Handicaps. Give the PCs a disadvantage, or their enemies an advantage. You might use the Battle Variants table on the next page for ideas. PART 4: THE ARENA 24 d20 Variant 1 No Surrender Allowed*. All combatants on the defeated side are to be killed. (You may wish to re-roll if this comes up early in the adventure, or if the opposing team is very difficult.) 2 Choose Your Weapon. The preparation rooms are empty of weapons, but each combatant may choose a weapon and be provided with it. Magical weapons, weapons with the Ammunition property (PHB146), and weapons that are very rare will not be provided. To make this easy to apply to NPCs: let most NPCs choose default weapons and only give an interesting weapon to one or two of them. 3 Unarmed. No weapons are provided. Foci and holy symbols are provided as usual. 4 Reach. Pikes (PHB149) are supplied instead of the normal weapons. There is one pike for every combatant. 5 Rush. No weapons are supplied in the preparation room. Instead, weapons are placed in the arena centre. Pick a few different melee weapons (PHB149) to put there. There is a 50% chance that foci and holy symbols will also be in the centre of the arena rather than in the preparation room. 6 Special Gear. Choose one of the following at random: bag of ball bearings, bag of caltrops, flask of oil (PHB150). d6 such items are added to the preparation room. Oil flasks come with a single torch and tinderbox. Roll for each team separately. 7 No Foci. Arcane foci, druidic foci and holy symbols are not provided in preparation rooms. Magic use is still allowed. 8 Chained. All combatants in each prisoner team are chained one-to- another in a line. As such, each prisoner has one or two “neighbours” in the chain. The chains attach by manacles (PHB152) to a single leg on each combatant. The chains are designed to not slow movement but no combatant may move more than 20 feet from their neighbours; because of this combatants may wish to use Ready actions (PHB193) to move together. Combatants may pull on the chain to shove (PHB195) others at a distance; either one of their neighbours or, more usefully, any creature occupying space between themselves and a neighbour. Neighbours can be pulled 5 feet closer using this special shove, they cannot be pushed away; other creatures can only be knocked prone. 9 Blindfolded. Two combatants from each prisoner team must wear a special, locked helmet with no eye-holes. The helmets render the wearer blinded (PHB290). If there are no volunteers for the helmets, the guards will choose who wears them. 10 Starting Positions. The combatants are arranged in an unusual way prior to the battle beginning. Teams might line up, face to face. Pairs made from opposing teams may be scattered around the arena. Against beasts, one prisoner may be placed well ahead of the others. 11 Staggered Start. All combatants are ordered to start the battle “inactive”. Inactive combatants are expected to not move or perform any actions. Once per round an individual from each team is allowed to become active. By default the team chooses who; a variation is to let the editor choose instead. If an inactive combatant is attacked by a foe, they are allowed to immediately become active. 12 Tied Up. All combatants enter the arena tied up. While they are tied up they are restrained (they are able to shuffle slowly into position). The restraints are designed to be fairly easy to escape from; they may be made of weak material and thus require a Strength check, or they may involve undoing a tricky knot and require a Sleight of Hand (Dexterity) check. You decide the DC, it should be around 10- 15; it might be a set value or a randomised value for each combatant (e.g. 3d6). Unrestrained characters have advantage on checks to untie someone else, or they may simply slice open the restraints (PHB151, PHB153, DMG246). Attempting to escape restraints before battle begins is considered disobedience (but only if someone notices!). d20 Variant 13 Capture the Combatant. The goal for each team is to bring an enemy to their edge of the arena. The enemy must be alive and not unconscious (PHB292). When the battle is between two prisoner groups, this is an optional means of instant victory – the losing team is considered to have surrendered. When prisoners face beasts it is mandatory to capture a beast – killing them all is considered disobedience. You may wish to purposefully select a single powerful beast for the purpose. 14 One on one*. Both teams select an individual from their own team to fight in the centre of the arena. The rest of the team must not interfere. When any combatant is defeated, both teams select again. A team loses when it has no remaining members. Prisoners are permitted to extract their defeated team-mates to the sidelines. Prisoners on the same team who are not in combat are permitted to interact with one another; including to cast spells. Refusing to select an individual to fight is considered disobedience. Participating in combat out-of-turn is considered disobedience, though combatants may get away with actions like the Rally maneuvre (PHB74) or spells like vicious mockery (PHB285) which may be disguised as normal banter. 15 Surprise Beasts. During the battle, at the editor’s command, the guards release some animals from the Beast Combat section (see below). You could determine randomly, or pick an entry. You might wish to pick a lower-CR entry to serve as a nuisance or distraction to the combatants, or a high-CR entry to really spice up the battle. 16 King of the Hill. An area of arena is marked out with a loop of rope. Usually it marks an area roughly 15 foot in diameter in the middle of the arena, but it could be elsewhere. Once per round, a single archer in the stands fires at a random prisoner outside the rope. Moving the rope is considered disobedience. An unfair variant on this is to allow one team to start inside the rope. 17 Capture the Flag(s)*. 1d6 objects are placed in the arena. Each team has a receptacle for said objects on their side of the arena (e.g. a barrel, a cage). When battle starts, a timer counts down for 3d6 rounds. The combatants may or not may not be told what the time limit is. When the timer expires, the team with the most objects in their receptacle wins. The other team is considered to have surrendered. Stealing objects and killing competitors is wholly allowed. Only objects that are in good condition are counted – for this reason you may wish to choose interesting objects like watermelons, live chickens, or even live scorpions (MM337) or poisonous snakes (MM334). Or you may wish to use heavy objects for a different kind of challenge (PHB176). To prevent this variant from devolving into a simple combat, you may wish to disallow weapons and/or foci. 18 Ribbon Wars*. Brightly coloured ribbons are put in the middle of the arena. Ribbons come in four or five different colours, and there is one less ribbon than there are combatants. Once per round, a single archer in the stands fires at a random prisoner not holding or clearly wearing a ribbon (ribbons are often tied to arms, legs or around the head). As battle proceeds the editor may call out colours – such colours of ribbon no longer offer protection. Combatants can use an action (PHB192) to tie a ribbon to themselves or untie a ribbon from a willing or incapacitated (PHB290) combatant. A successful unarmed strike (PHB195) can steal a ribbon off another combatant instead of inflicting damage. 19 Different rules*. Roll again for each faction and apply that rule to that faction only. If a rule does not make sense applied to only a single faction then apply default rules to that faction instead. 20 Roll twice. Roll on twice more on this table and, where possible, combine variants. * This variant is only valid when two groups of prisoners are battling one another. If rolled for a beast battle, presume default rules. PART 4: THE ARENA 25 Of course, you are encouraged to forgo the randomness and engineer battles to make your story memorable. Some suggestions follow. Grudge Match. What might bring in the crowds? A series of battles between rivals, culminating in a no-surrender duel? Testing the claims of a boastful combatant (“I could kill them all with one hand behind my back!”)? Giving a combatant with a crowd-pleasing killing style (perhaps a monk, or a magic user) plenty of fodder enemies to show off her talents? Prison Management. Troubles in the prison can be sorted out with arena fights. Throwing unwanted or troublesome prisoners into unfair or downright lethal fights is an obvious option. The PCs could potentially be on either side of such an unfair fight. Having the guards poison combatants before they enter the arena – Assassin’s Blood or Drow’s Poison (DMG257) – is especially villainous. But if troublesome prisoners are also crowd favourites it may be wiser to throw their friends (if they have any) into that kind of unfair fight. It forces compliance without risking anything valuable. BEAST COMBAT Use the table below to pick beasts when required. Creature Swaps. Use the creature rolled, or substitute it with something functionally similar. For example, a jackal could represent a mid-sized feral dog; a panther could be a mountain lion (MM317). Feel free to adjust the table below to remove creatures that aren’t a fit in your campaign world, or to add new creatures that are. Creature Quantity. The three right-most columns show the number of this type of animal to include to make a hard difficulty encounter (DMG82) for a party of four PCs at the specified level. Consider four PCs at level 2: they might fight three apes or six axe beaks. If the quantity shows zero the creature may be too difficult: you may wish to re-roll. Creatures in Combat. The beasts’ handlers will have ensured the creatures are aggressive and ready to fight. Cruelty is commonplace; the creatures may have been starved for days, or tormented immediately before release. Some of the more exotic creatures cannot be so easily enraged. In such a case, arena combatants are expected to instigate the attack, the idea being that the animal will defend itself. Refusing to attack a peaceful animal is considered disobedience. Consider that different creatures will fight differently. Wolves may fight as a pack, whereas giant crabs are not inclined to work together. Some animals are likely to be very aggressive; others may defensively stand off until provoked. d100 Creature CR Lvl 1 Lvl 2 Lvl 3 1 Ape (MM317) 1/2 2 3 5 2-6 Axe Beak (MM317) 1/4 3 6 9 7-10 Black Bear (MM318) 1/2 2 3 5 11-14 Boar (MM319) 1/4 3 6 9 15-18 Brown Bear (MM319) 1 1* 2 3 19-22 Cave Bear (MM334) 2 0 1* 2 23 Crocodile (MM320) 1/2 2 3 5 24-27 Dire Wolf (MM321) 1 28-29 Giant Boar (MM323) 2 0 1* 2 30 Giant Constrictor Snake (MM324) 2 0 1* 2 31-34 Giant Crab (MM324) 1/8 6 10 14 35 Giant Frog (MM325) 1/2 2 3 5 36 Giant Goat (MM326) 1/2 2 3 5 37 Giant Hyena (MM326) 1 1* 2 3 38-39 Giant Lizard (MM326) 1/4 3 6 9 40-49 Giant Rat (MM327) 1/8 6 10 14 50-53 Giant Scorpion (MM327) 3 0 1 1* 54 Giant Toad (MM329) 1 1* 2 3 55-56 Giant Weasel (MM329) 1/8 6 10 14 57-62 Hyena (MM331) 0 12 17 31 63-68 Jackal (MM331) 0 12 17 31 69-72 Lion (MM331) 1 1* 2 3 73-78 Mastiff (MM332) 1/8 6 10 14 79-80 Panther (MM333) 1/4 3 6 9 81-82 Sabre-Toothed Tiger (MM336) 2 0 1* 2 83-86 Tiger (MM339) 1 1* 2 3 87-94 Wolf (MM341) 1/4 3 6 9 95-100 Worg (MM341) 1/2 2 3 5 * Actually a Medium encounter (DMG82). PART 4: THE ARENA 26 TRAINING Occasionally the PCs will have a chance to train in the arena. They are under no obligation to train, but training can slightly improve their chances in future fights. Equipment. Prisoners will be given two lots of Default Preparation Room Equipment (see sidebar above). How they share it amongst themselves is up to them. Spectators. Training sessions may attract a few spectators, but nowhere near as many as a real battle. The relative quiet may allow spectators and prisoners to converse or otherwise interact. Guards. Guards are generally less alert during training. It’s not as exciting as an arena battle, there’s usually fewer prisoners involved, and prisoners are grateful of the training opportunity and less likely to misbehave. Guards will investigate any suspicious interaction between spectators and prisoners. TRAINING EXERCISES Explain the following training options to the players. During a training session a PC may train in one of these. These training benefits are intended to be limited to this adventure – not a permanent enhancement. Furthermore, they may only be used during arena battles. Conditioning. You improve your general fitness. You gain one temporary hit point (PHB198) at the beginning of every future arena battle. You may repeat this training to increase the amount of temporary hit points up to a maximum of 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). Weapon Training. You train with a particular type of weapon. You may re-roll the damage of a single attack you make with that weapon. Re-roll as many times as you have undertaken this training. You may choose to apply the initial roll, or any of the re-rolls. Once you use this training benefit, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Defensive Training. You practise evading and parrying attacks. You may re-roll the damage of a single attack made against you. Re-roll as many times as you have undertaken this training. You may choose to apply the initial roll, or any of the re-rolls. Once you use this training benefit, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Dirty Fighting. You concentrate on learning “unconventional” fighting techniques. You may gain advantage on a single opportunity attack, grapple, or shove attack (PHB195). Once you use this training benefit, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Combat Superiority. You consider non-obvious ways you can influence combat. You gain the benefit of the Martial Adept feat (PHB168), except you only learn one maneuver instead of two. If you already have this feat, or for every time you repeat this training, you may learn an additional maneuver. Battle Strategy. You practise co-ordinating as a team. You must perform this training with at least one other person (all participants share the same benefit). For every future arena battle, your Dexterity checks for initiative (PHB189) are increased by whichever of these two values is lesser: • The number of characters on your team that you have personally done this training with (excluding yourself). • The number of times you have done this training. ARENA ROOMS This section describes areas marked [4A] through [4F]. 4A. ARENA The arena is a shaft cave (also known as a pit cave, vertical cave, or pot); a naturally-forming vertical shaft in the rock. It has no ceiling and is open to the air. The shaft is roughly cylindrical, about eighty feet wide and one-hundred and forty feet high. The bottom of the shaft is the arena “stage” where fights occur. It is covered in a thick layer of sand. Light and Weather. Being open to the sky, the arena floor is effectively outdoors; dark at night, bright at day (PHB183). The weather can also come into play (DMG109), though the deep shaft protects against wind. Climbing. The rocky walls of the shaft become smoother from water weathering the further one climbs. Any climbing of the first forty feet requires a DC14 Strength (Athletics) check. At this height, they can access the spectator area [5C]. Any climbing of the next fifty is DC16. The final fifty feet is DC20. Anyone reaching the top can easily exit to the surface (see “The Outdoors” in Part 5). Failure by more than 5 means the PC falls (PHB183) some random point between the start and end of that section of climbing. Portcullises to Preparation Rooms. Iron portcullises (DMG104) lead towards the preparation rooms [4B], [4C] and [4D]. Their winches are on the spectator level [5C]. The portcullises can be manually lifted open from the ground with a DC30 Strength check. You may allow PCs to work together on this check (PHB175). The winch ropes can be destroyed, provided its attacker can reach the top of the eight-foot-tall gates. Consider a rope to have an AC of 11 and 2d4 hit points (DMG246). It is immune to poison and psychic damage; resistant to bludgeoning, cold, piercing and thunder damage; and vulnerable to acid, fire and slashing damage (PHB197). When destroyed, the gate slams closed and can only be manually lifted open. Secret Passage to Refuse Pit. There is a natural passage that connects the arena to the refuse pit [4E]. It is twenty feet above the floor of the arena. It is very difficult to notice against the craggy wall, requiring a DC19 Wisdom PART 4: THE ARENA 27 (Perception) check. Even if someone knows roughly what to look for it isn’t guaranteed to be found – the DC drops to 10. The passage is only a few feet high. Humanoid creatures must crawl through (PHB182). 4B, 4C, 4D. PREPARATION ROOMS These excavated chambers are used to hold arena combatants prior to battle. The contain some rudimentary furniture, such as stools, tables and weapon racks. Light. During the day, dim light bleeds in from the arena; at night it is dark. Equipment. Equipment is only left in these rooms when preparing arena combatants (see “Arena Battles”, above). Doors. The doors leading toward the guard room [4F] are iron gates. Sound and most ranged attacks can travel easily through them. They are extremely sturdy, requiring a DC35 Strength check to break. The lock can be picked with a DC 12 Dexterity check and a set of thieves’ tools. Information about the doors leading to the arena can be found in [4A]. 4E. REFUSE PIT This is another open-skied natural shaft like the arena. At one- hundred and forty feet it is just as tall, but is it only thirty-five feet across. Refuse is piled onto the floor here: domestic waste, sewage, even corpses. It stinks mightily. Forty feet up the northern wall is a ledge. Judging from the slant of the refuse pile, this is where the most of the garbage must be throw in from. Light and Weather. As per [4A]. The Refuse. There is nothing of value in the refuse, though you shouldn’t let the PCs know this. Allow them to make Wisdom (Perception) and/or Intelligence (Investigate) checks in vain. Anyone mucking about in the refuse is at risk of contracting Sewer Plague (DMG257). Ledge. See [5F] for more information. Door. The flimsy wooden door that leads back toward [4B] requires a DC13 Strength check to force open. It can also be picked with a DC 10 Dexterity check and a set of thieves’ tools. Secret Passage to Arena. The passage is the same height up the wall, and it is just as hard to spot from this side at the other; use the same rules from [4A]. Climbing. Use the same rules as the arena [4A]. 4F. GUARD ROOM This room houses the guards that monitor the prisoners. Light. This room is dimly lit with a few candles (PHB183). This suffices for the hobgoblin guards. Furniture. Basic furniture; tables, chairs, and lots of weapon, armour and equipment racks. Guards. Guards are stationed here at all times. At any particular moment there will be 1d4 + 4 hobgoblin guards. Alarm. A crude but extremely noisy iron bell exists in the room. The guards will use it to signal they need immediate and numerous reinforcement. When used, it will summon guards from [5A] and [5B]. Secret Tunnel. Behind the eastern wall is a secret tunnel. See [3H] for more information. A successful DC22 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the suspicious brickwork. Doors. The doors to this room are iron gates, as per [4B]. Keys. Several hangars hold keys for doors in [4B], [4C], [4D], [4E] and [4F]. Guards are supposed to carry keys only when they need them, and to return them to these hangars when done. The keys are organised but not labelled in a way the PCs can easily intuit. Note that no two doors use the same key, but several copies of each key exist. EQUIPMENT There’s plenty of weapons and armour here. It’s all for arena use (the guards store their equipment elsewhere). Common Arena Weapons. There are 3d6 of each of these: daggers, maces, nets, shields, shortswords, spears, scimitars, pikes and whips (PHB149). Uncommon Arena Weapons. There are 1d4 of any weapon (PHB149) that is not part of the common arena weapons (above) and does not have the ammunition property (PHB146). Spell Foci. There is an assortment of arcane foci, druidic foci and holy symbols (PHB150). Any caster PC will be able to find something suitable for themselves. Special Arena Gear. This stuff is used in special arena games. There’s 3d6 of each of these: bags of ball bearings, bags of caltrops, flasks of oil, manacles and chain (10 ft.) (PHB150). There’s 1d4 of each of theses: tinderboxes, torches and hempen rope (50 ft.). There’s 1d4 + 1 lockable helmets with no eye holes. Finally, there’s a large pile of coloured ribbons. Maintenance. There’s a whetstone (PHB150) and tinker’s tools (PHB154) here for equipment maintenance. PART 4: THE ARENA 28 PART 5: UPPER LEVEL PART 5: UPPER LEVEL 29 he upper level of Greger’s Grotto is like a small port town; just one that happens to be underground and welcoming of criminals. It has accommodation, entertainment and commerce. T GUARDS Quantity. The number of hobgoblin guards in Greger’s Grotto is equal to six multiplied by the number of PCs (minimum eighteen). This number doesn’t really matter until either: • All the guards become mobilised, typically in response to an escape attempt or major disruption caused by the PCs. • For whatever reason, guard numbers drop so low that it impacts their normal operations. As DM, you don’t necessarily need to track the position of every guard at all times. You should, however, keep track of their numbers. If their numbers drop low, their tactics may change, and they are less likely to be found at their normal posts. If they are wiped out, then the PCs won’t have to worry about them any more. Response to Upper Level Incursions. Any organised response firstly requires the alarm to be raised. This is possible with some of the alarm bells scattered around the Grotto, or simply by a runner being dispatched for help. If the PCs can keep the alarm for being raised they may have a distinct advantage. Should the alarm be raised, the guards will organise to respond, led by Drusus Skull-Skewer. How exactly the guards react is up to you. Keep in mind Drusus’ personality, and that his hobgoblin mercenaries are level-headed, sensible, patient and not the type to take unnecessary risks. INDEPENDENTS Not everyone at Greger’s Grotto is a member or employee of the Greger family. Most are visitors – privateers visiting to trade, resupply, rest or for recreation. This chapter refers to such folk as “independents”. Racial. The racial mix of independents should suit your campaign world. By default they primarily consist of humans, orcs, hobgoblins and goblins with a smattering of other humanoid races. Interaction. These independents are not beholden to the Greger family. They act in their own interest. By default they are indifferent to the PCs (DMG244), though if the PCs have a reputation this may differ. For example, if the PCs are arena favourites then independents may be friendly. Or, if the PCs are in the process of indiscriminately slaughtering everyone in their path, independents may be hostile. Like any group of people they have different and distinct personalties. NPC Types. Independents come in many types. When you need some, roll on this table. You can roll once per individual or once per group; the former gives variety, the latter may be easier to manage. Optionally, you can customise these NPCs (MM342) by changing weapons and armour or applying racial traits (DMG282). d20 Variant Treasure 1-4 Bandit (MM343). A typical bandit or pirate. x1 5 Bandit Captain (MM344)*. The pirate captain of a visiting ship. Will often try to take leadership in any encounter. x3 6-9 Commoner (MM345). Non-combatant sailors, indentured servants, oarsmen and non- professional auxiliaries like cooks. These independents are less eager to engage in combat. x1 10-13 Guard (MM347). The soldiers of the privateer world. Mercenaries, bodyguards and marines. x1 14-15 Noble (MM348). Black-market merchants and professional auxiliaries like navigators, surgeons and scribes. x1 16-17 Scout (MM349)*. Bounty hunters, trackers, or pirates with a penchant for ranged weaponry. x2 18-19 Thug (MM350)*. Officers and lieutenants of the criminal world, or simply tougher-than-average pirates. x2 20 Named NPC*. Select one of the following NPCs at random: Gladwin Greger, Gillian Greger, Godrick Greger, Gertrude Greger, Drusus Skull- Skewer, Harry Dodds. If it’s not appropriate for that NPC to be present, pick another NPC or re- roll on this table. n/a * These NPCs are tough. Consider limiting their occurrence both overall and per-encounter. Re-roll if necessary. Equipment and Treasure. Independents carry weapons and armour as per their NPC stat block. Each also carries coin as per Individual Treasure: Challenge 0-4 (DMG136): roll as many times as shown in the Treasure column above. Response to Upper Level Incursions. Being hardened criminal types, independents aren’t going to flee at the first hint of danger. Indeed, some may not care and all, and some may even find entertainment in guards fighting prisoners. Generally, though, they will avoid areas of conflict. If the prisoner uprising seems sufficiently dangerous they may consider retreating to the Grotto [5L]. PART 5: UPPER LEVEL 30 UPPER LEVEL ROOMS This section describes areas marked [5A] through [5Y]. COMMON FEATURES All areas in the upper levels have the following properties, unless otherwise specified by individual descriptions. Carved Chambers. Rooms in this section have been hewn from the rock. The workmanship is professional, but not ornate. Ceilings in most rooms are ten feet high, lowering to seven in corridors. Light. As humans and other races without darkvision frequent these halls, artificial illumination is needed. Torch sconces are used, and could easily be taken by PCs. Unless otherwise specified, the level of lighting is dim (PHB183). Doors. Unless otherwise specified, all doors are wooden and of decent quality. They can be broken open with a DC18 Strength check. Doors that are locked can be picked with a DC 14 Dexterity check and a set of thieves’ tools. Population. Room descriptions contain populations of guards, independents and special NPCs. These are guidelines only, intended for when all’s calm in the Grotto and it’s business as usual. You can and should override population guidelines as you see fit, especially in response to upheaval caused by the PCs. 5A. GUARD COMMONS Combined mess hall, recreation room and training area for off-duty guards. Because the guards work shifts, there’s always some here, day or night. Population. 2d4 hobgoblin guards and 1d12 – 8 independents. Alarm Bell. A large alarm bell hangs from the ceiling near the south-west corner of the room. If rung, it will alert guards from [4F], [5B] and [5C]. Equipment. There’s a modest amount of food and drink here. There’s three random gaming sets (PHB154) laid out on the tables. A dart-board with 20 darts (PHB149) is on one of the walls. 5B. GUARD BARRACKS Sleeping quarters for the prison guards. Crowded rows of beds with some containers and furniture to store personal gear. Population. 3d4 hobgoblin guards. There is a 50% chance they’ll all be asleep; if not, d4 are awake. Guards sleep with their weapons and armour close at hand, though of course they will not be able to don armour if woken by attackers. Awake guards have a 50% chance of wearing armour. Equipment. The guards have stowed away plenty of camping gear, as their usual job is on the field as mercenaries. There’s plenty of backpacks, bedrolls, blankets, common clothes, mess kits, tents, tinderboxes, waterskins and whetstones (PHB150). There’s also one fishing tackle and two trinkets (PHB159). Finally, there’s some spare weaponry kept in racks: 2d6 short swords, 2d4 shields, 1d6 short bows (PHB149) and 1d6 x 20 arrows (PHB150). Treasure. The guards keep some treasure amongst their belongings, but bear in mind that it would take an individual some twenty minutes to search through everything. The number of coins can be determined by rolling on the Individual Treasure: Challenge 0-4 table (DMG136) a number of times equal to the number of PCs in the adventure (minimum three). Secret Passage. Behind a cupboard in the back of the room is a short, roughly-hewn tunnel leading to [5M]. A successful DC19 Wisdom (Perception) check will notice a small part of the tunnel peeking out from behind the cupboard at floor height. With a successful DC13 Intelligence (Investigation) check, anyone searching through the guards’ belongings will notice the tunnel as they look through the cupboard. The tunnel is dark, but dim light (PHB183) can easily bleed in from the barracks. 5C. ARENA SPECTATOR AREA Forty feet above the arena floor [4A] a viewing area has been hewn from the shaft wall. The viewing area encircles the shaft, but does not overhang it. Outside of fights, this area serves as a social hub. Tables, chairs and settees are here (set away from the edge) for visitor’s comfort. Food and drink is often sold and consumed here. Population. Guards are always present in the spectator area whenever prisoners are in the arena below. There will usually be d4+1 hobgoblin guards, though more will be stationed during large or dangerous fights. The guards here will always be equipped with bows. Outside of fights, there are rarely guards present. There will be 2d20 independents during an arena fight, or double that for popular fights. Otherwise; during the day and early evening there will be d20 independents, during the night there will be d12 – 6. During a fight, an editor will be present. See Part 4 for choosing an editor. Light. Daylight seeps in well enough from the outside. At night, the spectator area may be brightly or dimly lit (PHB183) by artificial means, depending on whether it is in use. The Edge. A low two-foot stone barricade is all that prevents spectators from falling into the arena below – this offers no protection to anyone being shoved (PHB195). The floor around the edge is cleared to allow maximum room for PART 5: UPPER LEVEL 31 spectators. Most spectators stand at the edge for the best view. Some will sit on the barricade, some sit back from it. Gate Winches. There are three winches (DMG104) here, one above each gate to the arena floor. They are usually operated by guards. The Floor, The Shaft Walls. For information about this, see area [4A]. 5D. THE AMOROUS OCTOPUS TAVERN This is a large tavern. The bar is against the eastern wall, while tables and chairs fill the remaining space. Someone has painted an ornate mural of an octopus on the ceiling. Its nine tentacles traverse the breadth of the ceiling and even down some walls; ships and sailors are often shown tangled within. Population. Between midday and midnight: d20 + 2 independents and d12 – 8 hobgoblin guards. Otherwise: d8 + 2 independents and d20 – 16 hobgoblin guards. Two of the independents are always tavern staff. In addition, Gertrude Greger is likely to be here running the bar, especially when it is busy. Equipment. Plenty of food and drink (PHB158), especially behind the bar. The bar’s operating funds are frequently taken by Gertrude Greger so as to not grow too large; roll twice on the Individual Treasure: Challenge 0-4 table (DMG136). 5E. VISITOR COMMONS Rounded metal loops have been affixed to the ceiling of this chamber at regular intervals. From these hooks hang makeshift walls, made of scrap fabric like old sailcloth, which imperfectly partition the chamber into smaller “rooms”. In addition, various other things hang from the ceiling, including equipment, short lengths of rope, rudimentary candle holders, decorations made from bones and cheap beads, and even drying laundry. All this clutter makes it impossible to gauge exactly how big this chamber is. This large space has been partitioned into a number of “rooms” by draping scrap fabrics from the ceiling. The “rooms” serve as sleeping and meeting areas for visitors to the Grotto. Some basic furniture may be found in some of the “rooms”, but mostly visitors sleep on bedrolls. The fabric partitions offer some amount of privacy and sound-muffling. The quantity of partitions and other assorted hanging things makes this room lightly obscured (PHB183). The Rooms. Divide the area into a series of “rooms” each between 4 and 9 squares in area. Have a “corridor” provide access. Do not worry about getting it perfect – indeed imperfection is more realistic. Population. Each “room” contains d8 – 4 independents. They are likely to be engaged in down-time activities: sleeping, tending to equipment, talking quietly. Fire Hazard. The fabric partitions and bedding material makes in this chamber makes it a fire hazard. A single flame takes d4 rounds to blossom into anything dangerous; fires lit with an arsonist’s abandon or with an accelerant such as oil will spring up instantly. You may want to use the same rules for burning a Web spell (PHB288). You could also use the rules for suffocating (PHB183) if the fire grows large enough to output choking smoke. Treasure. No visitor would be foolish enough to leave anything valuable unattended. But PCs may find plenty of: bedrolls, blankets, candles, common clothes, and short lengths of rope (PHB150). 5F. REFUSE LEDGE A foul stench hits you. Looking down, you see the source. You’re on a small ledge overlooking a refuse pit. Above you is clear sky – this room is near the bottom of a large natural shaft. This ledge overlooks [4E]. See that room for more information. Door. A flimsy wooden door, it requires a DC12 Strength check to force open. It is has no handle, but is simply barred shut from the corridor [5F] side. Consequently, it cannot be picked. Due to the stench, visitors rarely forget to shut this door. 5G. GENERAL STORE A fully-stocked general store, run by Harry Dodds. Opening Hours. The store is open during daylight hours. When it is open the door is unlocked and customers can simply walk in. When it is closed the door is locked, and no- one is inside. Population. Dodds is highly likely to be here when the store is open. If not, use an independent as his employed store-manager. Additionally, a thug (MM350) is employed during open hours to provide security. While the store is open there are d6 – 2 independents shopping. Light. The store is brightly lit when the store is open. It is in darkness otherwise (PHB183). Store Stock. Items can be bought at the standard price (PHB143) or they can be stolen. Or liberated (much of the store’s items are stolen goods in the first place). The store potentially stocks items from the Armour and Shields table (PHB145), the Weapons table (PHB149), and the Adventuring Gear table (PHB150) that cost 100 gp or less. To determine the stock count of any item roll a d100, halve it, then divide by the cost of item in gp, rounding down. The store also stocks basic items as a general store would, including the cheaper non-livestock items in the Trade Goods table (PHB157). Treasure. The store’s cash-on-hand can be determined by rolling four times on Individual Treasure: Challenge 0-4 (DMG136). PART 5: UPPER LEVEL 32 5H. SALVAGE WAREHOUSE Behind a set of large doors is a dark, cavernous chamber. Hulking wrecks of ships stand eerily in the gloom. The scent of rotting wood is apparent. This room is a warehouse used to store things salvaged from wrecked ships. It contains all sorts of material – old sails, piles of wooden planks, barrels of old nails, and even parts of old hulls. The idea was to create a common place for salvage materials for the public good; the reality is that anything decent has been taken long ago and it’s mostly a dumping ground. Population. This chamber is almost always empty: d20 – 18 independents are browsing the materials here. Light. The room is in darkness when its doors are closed, it is dimly lit otherwise (PHB183). Metagame Bluff. There is nothing of interest in this room, but you may wish to use it to subvert your players’ metagame thinking (DMG235). As they enter this room do something suspicious; have them take meaningless Perception checks or secretly roll some dice. 5 J. GREGER’S WAREHOUSE The contents of this large chamber must be worth a small fortune. There are sacks and barrels of valuable trade goods, coin chests of various sizes, and various expensive-looking pieces of art including paintings, vases, small statues, tapestries, books and jewellery on display stands. The room is spotlessly clean and everything is well-organised. This is Gladwin Greger’s personal treasure store. It represents years of work and trading with visitors to the Grotto. Population. This room is not open to the general public. Gladwin Greger occasionally visits to stock-take and keep the place in order, or to deposit or fetch something to be traded. He usually enters via the secret entrance. Very rarely he may show this room to prestigious visitors – he will convey such guests through the regular entrance. Light. When Greger is present the room is brightly lit, otherwise it is in darkness (PHB183). Main Doors. The large wooden doors on the western wall are high-quality and secure, for obvious reasons. Breaking the door requires a successful DC 28 Strength check; picking the lock requires a DC 22 Dexterity check and a set of theives’ tools. Secret Passage. On the northern wall there’s a cheap, heavy tapestry behind which is a secret passage to Gladwin’s quarters. A large table is positioned in front of the tapestry to minimise the chances of anyone accidentally touching the it. A passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 will notice scrape- marks on the floor where the table has been frequently moved. The secret passage is trapped: see [5P] for information. Treasure. Not everything item in this room is of value. Some items are fairly worthless, but are appreciated by Gladwin for sentimental or aesthetic reasons. Some items may have value but are too bulky to be easily taken. That said, there is plenty of value. Roll on the Treasure Hoard Challenge 0-4 table (DMG137). Add an additional 2d4 25 gp art objects to whatever you roll. Also add these trade goods (PHB157): 2d6 lb of pepper, 2d4 sq. yd. of linen, 1d4 sq. yd. of silk and 1d4 – 1 lb of saffron. Finally, add 1d4 trinkets (PHB159). Trapped Chest. There are several chests containing the hoard’s coins, the smallest of them is a decoy. It is trapped: when its latch is opened a small needle springs out to jab the user’s fingers. The person opening the chest has a 1-in-10 chance that the needle will happen to miss their fingers; otherwise they take one piercing damage. The needle is coated in Drow Poison (DMG258). It’s impossible to passively notice this trap, and it’s extremely unlikely the PCs will be investigating each object in the hoard for traps. But if they are, a successful DC20 Intelligence (Investigate) check will spot the trap, at which point it can be opened in a way to avoid the needle. A successful DC15 Dexterity check with thieves’ tools can disarm the trap, or re-arm it, though the poison will wear off the first time the needle jabs someone. There is nothing inside the decoy chest. PART 5: UPPER LEVEL 33 5K. EMPTY WAREHOUSE This warehouse is not currently being used. It’s empty save for a few crates and barrels stacked in the corners. The lack of activity means the area is quite filthy and dusty, and is home to various small vermin. The doors are kept closed. Population. Generally, no-one visits this room. On very rare occasions, some independents may visit if they seek privacy; though the filth discourages extended stays. Light. The room is in darkness when its doors are closed, it is dimly lit otherwise (PHB183). Metagame Bluff. There is nothing of interest in this room, but you may wish to use it to subvert your players’ metagame thinking (DMG235). As they enter this room do something suspicious; have them take meaningless Perception checks or secretly roll some dice. 5L. GREGER’S GROTTO You’re in a massive natural cave that has been turned into an underground harbour. Most of the cavern is water, but nearer to you the floor raises steeply from the depths to form a wide shelf of dry land. On this land is what you might see in any harbour – sacks and barrels, coils of rope, stacks of planks and bundles of sail. Jetties extend into the water, against these ships of various sizes are moored. Artificial torches light up the whole area. Looking further out, across the dark water-filled cavern interior, you think you can see the faint light of the outside world. This is the underground habour that defines Greger’s Grotto. It is a bustling harbour by day, and even by night there’s some activity. Size. The Grotto’s exact dimensions are up to you, and may be influenced by the ships in your campaign world (PHB157, DMG119). It’s not difficult to imagine lighter ships like Greek hemiolia or Viking longships fitting underground. You could expand the cavern to allow for massive barques and galleons, or have them dock out to sea with longboats conveying people and goods into the harbour. Light. The harbour area and jetties are well-lit at all times, providing bright light. Some areas at the peripheries may be dimly lit (PHB183). Population. There are 3d20 independents on the harbour by day, d12 by night. This does not include people on the ships. Ships. Ships are often coming and going. There are d6 ships docked at any particular time. A moored ship has d12 independents on board, and they generally are working on the ship by day and sleeping by night. A ship that has freshly moored, or is about to launch, has all crew on-board and so has 3d6 independents. Treasure and Equipment. On the docks and in the ships are mostly shipping supplies, empty containers (PHB153) and low-value trade goods (PHB157). At your discretion ships could contain more expensive trade goods or treasure (DMG137). You could also add items like navigator’s tools (PHB154) and spyglasses (PHB150) for a nautical theme, though beware of the latter’s price. Ocean. By moving out into the grotto one will come to the open ocean. The grotto’s entryway is concealed against a length of craggy cliffs. Nearer to the harbour, there’s an underwater tunnel leading to [3P]. The tunnel entrance would be nearly impossible to find without prior knowledge. 5M. TAVERN STORES A well-stocked tavern store room, containing various barrels and bottles of drink (PHB158). Light. This room is dark. If the door to the tavern [5D] is open, it is dimly lit (PHB183). Population. Usually no-one is here. This room is visited by the tavern staff occasionally – once every 1d6 x 10 minutes between midday and midnight, once every 1d4 hours otherwise. Secret Passage. A rack of wine bottles can be slid aside to reveal a short, roughly-hewn tunnel leading to [5B]. A successful DC17 Wisdom (Perception) check will notice fine pebbles and dust (loose debris from the tunnel) in front of the wine rack. With a successful DC15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, anyone searching through the goods in this room will notice the tunnel as they inspect the wine rack. The tunnel is dark, but dim light (PHB183) can easily bleed in from the store room. PART 5: UPPER LEVEL 34 5N. GLADWIN’S QUARTERS This is a bedroom, and a fine one at that. The furnishings here – including a large poster bed and some wardrobes and drawers – are of a quality that would suit minor nobility. Patterned tapestries hang against the walls, hiding the cold stone from view. This is the main bedroom of Gladwin and Gillian Greger. Population. There is a 25% chance of Gladwin or Gillian being in this room during daylight hours (roll separately for each individual). Those odds increase to 90% during the night; during which time they will be asleep. Light. The room is brightly lit when someone is there, provided they are not sleeping. It is in darkness otherwise (PHB183). Equipment. The room contains typical domestic supplies, including blankets, a lamp, a steel mirror and 2d4 vials of perfume. There’s also two sets of fine clothes and two sets of traveller’s clothes (PHB150). Treasure. Coins can be found in some of the drawers. Roll once on the Individual Treasure: Challenge 0-4 (DMG136). There is a 50GP gemstone (DMG134) hidden away at the back of one of the drawers. Anyone searching the drawer will find it on a successful DC10 Intelligence (Investigate) check. 5P. GLADWIN’S STORE ROOM A store-room. Like many spare rooms in domestic settings, this one has accumulated a selection of junk, including a dining table, a desk, several chairs (one of which is broken), a large cracked mirror, and two open crates with various odds and ends inside. Population. This room is not occupied save for the rare occasion when Gladwin Greger uses it as a thoroughfare between his quarters [5N] and his warehouse [5 J]. Light. The room is in darkness. If Gladwin’s Quarters [5N] are lit, and the intervening door is open, dim light bleeds into this room. Equipment. The room contains various mundane odds and ends. Choose 2d6 items at random from the Adventuring Gear table (PHB150). At your discretion you may wish to ignore items worth more than a few gold pieces. Secret Passage. The large cracked mirror obscures an opening to the secret passage. A successful DC14 Wisdom (Perception) check will notice dust is curiously absent on the mirror, particularly on either side where one might grasp it to move. The passageway itself contains a pit trap (DMG122). A section of floor gives way when stood on, dropping into a shallow pit (2 feet deep) full of short, sharp metal spikes. Falling onto the spikes inflicts d6 piercing damage; anyone taking damage has their walking speed reduced by 10 feet until they regain the lost hit points. A successful DC12 Wisdom (Perception) check allows a PC to notice that the stone is of a different colour and type than the rest of the tunnel. The trap is easily avoided by carefully stepping over it. 5Q. GLADWIN’S STUDY This room is a study. It contains an elegant writing desk and a comfortable-looking padded wooded chair. A large patch of off-white cloth covers the northern wall; a crude horse-head emblem has been stitched onto it. Population. During the day, there is a 15% chance of Gladwin Greger being present. Light. The room is brightly lit when Gladwin is there. It is in darkness otherwise. If Gladwin’s Quarters [5N] are lit, and the intervening door is open, dim light bleeds into this room (PHB183). Equipment. The desk holds a vial of antitoxin, vials of ink and sheets of paper (PHB150). The only writings on the desk are financial accounts; they are written in the common language (DMG123) and show that the Grotto is moderately profitable. Cloth Wall Covering. This is a section of sail from a navy or coastal patrol ship, sunk by pirates during a famous battle. Greger keeps it as a memento. A successful DC14 Intelligence (History) check means a PC knows the significance. 5R. GODRICK’S QUARTERS This is a single-room private quarters. Two things stand out immediately. First, there are three desks here as well as several bookshelves of various sizes. Secondly, the place is filthy. There’s discarded items everywhere: crockery with day-old left-over food and drink, the occasional coin, discarded clothes (mostly undergarments and black robes), open books, scraps of paper and scrolls, half-melted candles, peculiar reagents in jars, and statues, totems and foci from strange and distant cultures. Population. During the day, there is a 50% chance of Godrick Greger being present. That chance rises to 95% at night, at which point he will be sleeping. Light. The room is brightly lit when Godrick is there, provided he is not sleeping. It is in darkness otherwise (PHB183). Dim light bleeds through from the corridor [5X] if the door is left open. PART 5: UPPER LEVEL 35 Equipment. Godrick’s collection of arcane knick-knacks is impressive in quantity, but not so much in quality. Most of the items are worthless and useless. There are some choice items amongst the trash, but finding them isn’t easy. Searching takes two minutes and requires a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check. If the searching PC is prepared to spend longer, decrease the DC; it drops by 2 every time the search time is doubled. On success, reveal an item from the below table. Reroll any items already discovered. When all items are discovered, you may announce that the room has been completely searched. Alternatively, if the PCs have no time pressures, forgo searching and reveal all items in the table to them. Describe items as they appear to the PCs: don’t necessarily reveal any magical properties (or lack thereof). d20 Discovered Items 1 A random trinket (PHB160). 2 A small book, written in Halfling (PHB123). It contains amusing poems, limericks and songs about a fictional dwarf who uses brute force to overcome every problem. 3 A ceremonial dagger (PHB149) with a serpentine blade. 4 A poisoner’s kit (PHB154). 5 A steel mirror (PHB150). 6 A large oil painting, carefully rolled up. It depicts a human paladin in plate mail battling a bronze dragon. His weapon is a fast-moving blur. The dragon’s lightning breath engulfs the man to little apparent effect. 7 1d4 gemstones worth 10 gp (DMG134). 8 1d6 arcane foci. Randomly determine type (PHB150). 9 1d4 divine foci. Randomly determine type (PHB150) and deity suitable to your campaign (DMG10). 10 1d4 flasks of holy water (PHB150). 11 1d4 potions of healing (PHB153). 12 A vial of alchemist’s fire (PHB150). 13 A vial of acid (PHB150). 14 A potion of growth (DMG187). 15 1d4 – 1 spell scrolls (1st level) (minimum 1) (DMG139). 16 1d4 – 2 spell scrolls (2nd level) (minimum 1) (DMG139). 17 Roll three times against Magic Items Table B (DMG144), take the single lowest result. 18 Two recorded 1st level wizard spells (PHB114, PHB210). 19 One recorded 2nd level wizard spell (PHB114, PHB210). 20 Wand of Magic Detection (DMG211). 5S. DRUSUS’ QUARTERS Drusus’ quarters are spartan and tidy. There’s a bed, a desk, and a simple armour and weapon rack. Population. During the day, there is a 25% chance of Drusus Skull-Skewer being present. That chance rises to 95% at night, at which point he will be sleeping. Light. The room is in darkness (PHB183). Dim light bleeds through from the corridor [5X] if the door is left open. Equipment. Anyone searching through the room will find an abacus, a backpack, a bedroll, a blanket, three sets of common clothes, one set of traveller’s clothes and a whetstone (PHB150). When sleeping, Drusus hangs his weapons and armour on the racks. On the desk is a book that contains finances for Drusus’ mercenary group, written in the goblin language (DMG123). It shows that the Gregers pay a fair amount, though the mercenary group has been hired for far more profitable contracts in its past. 5T. EMPTY QUARTERS This room is occasionally used as guest quarters. At the moment it is unoccupied. It contains a bed and bedroom furniture, but nothing else. Population. No-one uses this room. Light. The room is in darkness (PHB183). Dim light bleeds through from the corridor [5X] if the door is left open. Metagame Bluff. There is nothing of interest in this room, but you may wish to use it to subvert your players’ metagame thinking (DMG235). As they enter this room do something suspicious; have them take meaningless Perception checks or secretly roll some dice. 5U. GERTRUDE’S QUARTERS Gertrude’s quarters are clean and tidy. Her room includes a bed, some chests, and a wardrobe. Population. During the day, there is a 10% chance of Gertrude Greger being present. That chance rises to 80% at night, at which time she will be sleeping. Light. The room is well-lit (PHB183) if Gertrude is present and not sleeping. It is in darkness otherwise. Dim light bleeds through from the corridor [5X] if the door is left open. Equipment. Anyone searching the room will find: two sets of common clothes, one set of fine clothes, one set of traveller’s clothes, a white-feathered axe beak costume, soap (PHB150), brewer’s supplies, a lute, a horn and a drum (PHB154). PART 5: UPPER LEVEL 36 5V. DODDS’ QUARTERS Dodds’ quarters contain a bed, a desk, and a set of drawers. A small chest sits atop the drawers. Population. During the day, there is a 10% chance of Harry Dodds being present. That chance rises to 80% at night, at which time he will be sleeping. Light. The room is well-lit (PHB183) if Dodds is present and not sleeping. It is in darkness otherwise. Dim light bleeds through from the corridor [5X] if the door is left open. Equipment. Anyone searching the room will find: two sets of common clothes, one set of traveller’s clothes, a vial of basic poison (PHB150), a dice set and a playing card set (PHB154). Treasure. The small chest atop the drawers has been chained (PHB151) to the drawers. A single lock (PHB152) keeps the lid closed and keeps the chain fastened to the chest. A PC proficient with theives’ tools can use them to open this lock on a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Inside is coin as per the Individual Treasure: Challenge 0-4 table (DMG136) (roll twice). There are also 1d4 gemstones worth 10 gp and 1d8 – 6 gemstones worth 50 gp (DMG134). 5W. TRAVELLER’S SHRINE This candle-lit room is a small temple. Centred on the far wall is a shrine to a deity thought to protect sailors. There are other smaller shrines to a variety of deities – including some lesser-known ones. It’s not quite the same selection you might find in a town church. Offerings are present on many of the altars. This small shrine is where visitors to the Grotto pray for protection in their voyages. Population. This small shrine is “self-service” and has no priests or other staff. There are 1d12 – 8 independents here during the day, or 1d20 – 18 at night. Prior to a ship setting sail the numbers can swell, even to the point of a queue forming. Shrine Divinity. You should use deities suitable to your campaign world (DMG10). The main shrine should be to a deity that represents sailors, or the ocean. The other deities should cater to the tastes of the Grotto’s criminal visitors. Equipment. There is a large number of candles here (PHB150). There are also various ornaments and trinkets that could serve as makeshift holy symbols (PHB58); though the deities on offer may not be to the taste of certain law-abiding or civilised PCs. Treasure. Valuable offerings to the gods are often stolen by less devout visitors, and are periodically cleaned out by Gladwin Greger (though he does use the money on shrine maintenance). Roll four times on Individual Treasure: Challenge 0-4 (DMG136), but take only the two lowest d100 rolls. 5X. OVERLAND EXIT At the northern end of this long corridor is an exit to the outdoors. Population. As a lower-traffic thoroughfare, this corridor contains 1d20 – 16 independents. There are 2 hobgoblin guards stationed at the northern doors. These guards can see down the length of the corridor, and know that most of the rooms are private. They will attempt to stop any suspicious interlopers. Northern Door. Large double doors block the way to the outside. The doors are thick, made of wood and reinforced with iron. But they have no traditional lock. Instead, a heavy wooden beam is used as a bar. This bar can be removed from the inside with a successful DC7 Strength check. Breaking in from the outside is very difficult and would require a heavy- duty ram, hours of deconstruction, or powerful magic. The door contains a small viewing slit, which the guards use to eyeball visitors. The guards keep the gate barred at all times, except when letting visitors in and out. 5Y. INTERNAL CORRIDOR Population. This corridor contains 1d20 – 4 independents during the day, and 1d12 – 6 during the night. As a high- traffic thoroughfare people are constantly coming and going. During the day 1d6 – 2 hobgoblin guards stand watch in the area, on the lookout for troublemakers. This falls to 1d6 – 4 at night. Gradient. This corridor is not level: its western end is about one storey lower than its eastern end. The gradient is fairly shallow in the eastern half, and greater in the western half. PART 5: UPPER LEVEL 37 THE OUTDOORS The main ways to exit Greger’s Grotto are: the main doors [5X], the underwater grotto [5L], and the underwater tunnel in the Haunted Caverns [3P]. It may also be possible for PCs to escape by climbing up and out of natural shafts in [3A], [3B], [4A] or [4E]. Generally speaking, if the PCs manage to escape to the outdoors then they have finished the adventure. It is anti- climactic to consider their journey back to civilisation (though this could certainly be part of your next adventure). Lingering in the Outdoors. But in some cases the PCs may wish to linger. Maybe there are more people still trapped in Greger’s Grotto – PCs or NPCs – and those on the outside wish to heal up or bide their time waiting to act. Or maybe the PCs have unfinished business exacting revenge or collecting treasures. If they wish to linger, they may have to survive in the wilderness. THE WILDERNESS Greger’s Grotto is isolated – it has to be to stay unnoticed by the authorities. There are no settlements within a few days’ travel and few civilians venture this way. It’s wilderness all around. Coastline. The entry to Greger’s Grotto [5L] is naturally camouflaged by a coastline of craggy cliffs and rocky outcrops. There are plenty of smaller, uninhabited caves and caverns along this stretch of coast; enough to confound anyone looking for a hideout. Climate and Terrain. Greger’s Grotto is in your campaign world, so you decide what the surrounding wilderness is like: tundra, desert or anything in-between. If you’re unsure, or it doesn’t matter, assume a temperate environment surrounded by patches of woodland and grassland. Foraging. Rules for foraging exist on DMG111. Weather Hazards. The risks of extreme weather are explained on DMG109. In addition to that, PCs may suffer on cold nights (less than 10 degrees Celcius or 40 degrees Fahrenheit) if they do not have camping equipment or do not have shelter, especially if rain or wind is also present. Such PCs must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving through or gain one level of exhaustion (PHB291). Apply exhaustion after any gains from a long rest taken during this period (PHB186). PCs with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw. Finding or building a shelter requires a Wisdom (Survival) check of DC10. Such a check can be attempted only once per day, though once succeeded the same shelter can be re-used. PRIVATEER ACTIVITY Any PCs trying to hide out above ground will find it exceedingly easy to do so. On Land. Guards are posted at the door [5X], but do not otherwise patrol the area. Occasionally independents may take walks, but they will generally not stray far. Depending on where Greger’s Grotto is situated in your campaign world it may or may not make sense for visitors to arrive by land. At Sea. Ships come and go from Greger’s Grotto fairly regularly. Pursuit. Generally speaking, prisoners that manage to escape into the wilderness are not pursued; they are considered a lost cause. PART 5: UPPER LEVEL 38 APPENDIX A: NPCS AND MONSTERS BUGBEAR GUARD Medium humanoid (goblinoid), chaotic evil Armour Class 14 (studded leather) Hit Points 27 (5d8 + 5) Speed 30 ft.

Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 12 (3d6+2) slashing damage. Bugbear Guards are not mentioned in the adventure notes above. You can include them if you feel an encounter with Drusus Skull-Skewer or his hobgoblin guards needs more difficulty: these would be the special reserve troops Drusus would only commit if things were going wrong. If you do include them, do not add more than a few across the whole adventure. BUGBEAR PRISONER Medium humanoid (goblinoid), chaotic evil Armour Class 14 (shield) Hit Points 27 (5d8 + 5) Speed 30 ft.

Hit: 3 bludgeoning damage. Bugbear Prisoners do in captivity what they did out of it – act as shock-troops for hobgoblin allies. Their ability to both give and take large amounts of damage makes them a considerable threat. Weapons. Prisoners are generally unarmed. A variety of weapons are presented here for arena combat. Don’t forget to remove the AC bonus for a shield if you choose a two-handed weapon. APPENDIX A: NPCS AND MONSTERS 39 DRUSUS SKULL-SKEWER Medium humanoid (goblinoid), lawful neutral Armour Class 17 (splint) Hit Points 28 (3d10 + 12) Speed 30 ft.

Drusus can deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage to a creature he hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of Drusus that isn’t incapacitated. Second Wind (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). (PHB72) On his turn, Drusus can use a bonus action to regain d10 + 4 hitpoints. Superiority Die x4 (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). (PHB73) Drusus knows these maneuvers: Commander’s Strike, Precision Attack, Rally. The maneuver save DC is 12. ACTIONS Greatsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 3 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage. EQUIPMENT AND TREASURE Greatsword (PHB149), splint armour (PHB150), common clothes (PHB150), a keyring containing keys to doors in [3A] [4B] [4C] [4D] [4E] [4F], Individual Treasure: Challenge 0 – 4 (DMG136) (roll twice). Drusus Skull-Skewer is captain of a hobgoblin mercenary group. He is currently employed by Gladwin Greger to provide security to Greger’s Grotto. A hobgoblin wearing fastidiously-maintained armour. He carries himself with confidence. His face is expressionless, his shifting gaze suggests a certain level of wariness or alertness. Mannerisms. He is extremely dour, rarely laughing or even smiling. His anger is reserved only for discipline and intimidation, and even then it is more for show than genuine emotion. Interaction Traits. He speaks only when necessary and remains silent otherwise. Ideal. He seeks military victories, but only prizes them when they are done right. A sloppily-executed or brute-force triumph is no triumph at all. Bond. He exhibits strong solidarity with his mercenary brothers; he will not frivolously or carelessly put them at risk. He takes his mercenary contracts very seriously and would rather die than break a contract. Flaw. While not opposed to tactical deceptions such as ambushes and feints, he resents being deceitful in conversation. Basically, he cannot lie. Story Ideas. Part-way through the adventure, Drusus might leave the grotto with all of his hobgoblin mercenaries. This parting might be permanent (failed contract re- negotiation), long-term (assigned to protect one of Gladwin’s off-site ventures) or short-term (recreational). Whatever the case, the Gregers quickly hire a band of goblins as replacements. Each hobgoblin guard is replaced by two goblin guards. Drusus is replaced by a goblin boss (MM166). The goblins are far less competent and confident than the hobgoblins; they are actually afraid of the prisoners. This makes them harder to trick but easier to intimidate. They would rather starve out rebellious prisoners than charge in and re-establish order. Their fear causes them to be more abusive when it comes to doling out punishment. Use this story event if you feel the PCs need an an easier time escaping, or if they need some encouragement. A temporary change puts the PCs under pressure to escape before the hobgoblin guards return. You can lower the number of goblin guards replacing each hobgoblin guard to make escape even easier. APPENDIX A: NPCS AND MONSTERS 40 DWARF GHOST Medium undead, lawful neutral Armour Class 11 Hit Points 45 (10d8) Speed 0 ft., fly 40 ft. STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 7 (-2) 13 (+1) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 12 (+1) 17 (+3) Damage Resistances acid, fire, lightning, thunder; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons Damage Immunities cold, necrotic, poison Condition Immunities charmed, exhaustion, frightened, grappled, paralysed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained Senses darkvision 60ft., passive perception 11 Languages Dwarf, Common Challenge 2 (450 XP) Ethereal Sight. The ghost can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa. Incorporeal Movement. The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. ACTIONS Ghostly Pickaxe. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage. Frightening Visage. Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also suffers one level of exhaustion (PHB291). A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Frightening Visage for the next 24 hours. This dwarf ghost haunts an isolated series of caverns. It is a “lesser” kind of ghost compared to the “regular” type (MM147). This dwarf is transparent and glows with a faint blue light. When he speaks his voice reverberates in an otherworldly fashion Otherwise, he seems not unusual for a dwarf. He looks to be a miner. He wears simple, ragged clothes and a small pack; along with his skin and long braided beard these are covered in a thick sooty residue. He carries a mining pick in one hand, the handle of which has been looped with twine to provide a better grip. Mannerisms. He tugs gently on his beard when thinking or when annoyed. Interaction Traits. He is direct to the point of being tactless. Ideal. He believes in solidarity and never betrays a loyalty. Bond. He wishes to lead his dwarven brothers and sisters to freedom, or to a noble death in trying. Flaw. He is quick to judge others lazy, cowards, or disloyal. He often views disagreement as dissidence. Death Denial. As the ghost believes he is still alive, he doesn’t willingly leverage his incorporeal nature; he doesn’t fly up in the air, move through solid objects, or leave the material plane. First Encounter. The ghost is initially indifferent (DMG244) to the PCs. In his confused state, he believes they are fellow dwarves, and will demand they get to work digging out the tunnel [3N]. Being a stubborn sort, he will not react well to being refused or ignored; he will accuse the PCs of laziness and mutiny, growing hostile and eventually attacking the characters. Mining Expertise. The ghost is an expert on mining and minerals. They may find his expertise valuable in the escape tunnel [3N], if they think to ask. Indulging Delusions. The PCs can best exploit his confused mind by staying within the bounds of his delusion. For example, if the PCs refuse to work the tunnel because “our shift just ended” he may apologise and resume his wandering. Such interaction ability checks (PHB186) should be easy (DC 5 or 10), but only while they are fresh. Even the confused ghost won’t fall for the same tale several times. Accusations. The ghost stubbornly refuses to believe “nonsense” about him being dead. Demonstrations of his ghostly nature do little to sway his mind. APPENDIX A: NPCS AND MONSTERS 41 Raising the topic of killing of his last followers can be an effective, but only if the PCs can relate enough detail to jog his memory. Where the killings occurred, with what weapon, and why. This could involve an interaction check (PHB186) of DC25, with each fact reducing the DC by 5. On success, the ghost becomes distraught. “I had no choice!” the ghost yells, his voice thundering at an unnatural volume. “They wanted to go back! Back to being slaves. I couldn’t allow it.” Then, the ghost collapses on the floor, sobbing and screaming. His wails echo eerily throughout the caverns. While in this state he is effectively stunned (PHB292). He will remain in such a state until he succeeds at a DC15 Wisdom saving throw; such a check is made every ten minutes, or at the end of any round where he is damaged. After recovering he will be enraged, attacking any creature on sight. He will calm down to his old self after d4 days, or when destroyed; whichever comes first. Destruction. The ghost can be destroyed in combat, but he will return to its haunting in d4 days. He will have no memory of the event. Unfinished Business. The ghost can be permanently put to rest by either completing the tunnel to the surface, or by taking the remains of the dwarves and giving them a proper burial of some sort. Neither of these is likely attainable by the PCs during the campaign, but perhaps this could be part of a future adventure.

Festan’s weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 (PHB72). Martial Advantage (1/Turn). Festan can deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage to a creature he hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of Festan that isn’t incapacitated. Second Wind (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). (PHB72) On his turn, Festan can use a bonus action to regain d10 + 3 hitpoints. ACTIONS Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage. Unarmed. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 3 bludgeoning damage. Festan Elf-Cleaver is the leader of the hobgoblin prisoner faction. Previously, he was a skilled soldier. His older brother was killed in a humiliating defeat against elves. Spurred by revenge he deserted his unit to hunt and kill elves in small guerilla actions, often taking sympathetic soldiers with him. Repeatedly captured, corporal punishment did not dissuade him, so his superiors eventually consigned him to slavery. The hobgoblin prisoner carries many scars, presumably from combat, and his back is marred by what must be dozens upon dozens of calloused lashings inflicted some time in the past. Otherwise, this prisoner is tall and strong; even for his kind. Mannerisms. He stands tall, stiff-backed, and tends to fold his arms when talking. Interaction Traits. He is direct and to-the-point in conversation. He is irritated by small-talk and pleasantries and demands to get to the point. Ideal. Like most of his kind, he believes in military professionalism and the solidarity of soldiers. He believes honour is a very real thing that can be won or lost in combat. APPENDIX A: NPCS AND MONSTERS 42 Bond. He ultimately wishes to be free so he may continue his revenge-fuelled war against elvenkind. But he must do this the honourable way: in the arena. No matter what transpires, he will not abandon his current hobgoblin “brothers”. Flaw. His beliefs about being a professional soldier often clash with his hatred for elves and desire for revenge against them. This conflict, when it arises, troubles him greatly. Story Ideas. The stories of Festan’s unsanctioned campaigns against elves are well-known. Most hobgoblins, including the guards, are inclined to forgive desertion for such a good cause. Festan, therefore, enjoys soft treatment by the guards. This could lead to him enjoying unfair advantages in the arena. As a potential source of conflict, Festan’s hatred of elves could be turned to any other race to suit your adventure and the PCs in it. Weapons. Prisoners are generally unarmed. A variety of weapons are presented here for arena combat. Don’t forget to remove the AC bonus for a shield if you choose a two-handed weapon.

(PHB96) Gertrude can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action (PHB192). Sneak Attack (1/Turn). (PHB96) Gertrude deals an extra 7 (2d6) damage when she hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Gertrude that isn’t incapacitated and Gertrude doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. ACTIONS Rapier. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 7 (d8 + 3) slashing damage. Dagger. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. EQUIPMENT AND TREASURE Rapier, four daggers, (PHB149), common clothes (PHB150), flute (PHB154), thieves’ tools (PHB154), playing card set (PHB154). Individual Treasure: Challenge 0 – 4 (DMG136). Gertrude Greger is the adult daughter of the Gladwin family. Her main job is operating the Amorous Octopus Tavern. A stout young human woman with unkempt shocks of red hair. She wears the outfit of a bar maid, though heavy leather boots and several sheathed blades confuse the look. Mannerisms. She is constantly brushing aside her unkempt hair. She speaks loudly but hesitantly, over-using “umms” and “erms”. Interaction Traits. She is friendly while still being assertive. Ideal. Kind and compassionate, she likes to make others happy and dislikes seeing people suffer. Bond. She is dedicated to her family and her tavern. Flaw. She is troubled by the criminal elements around her; she worries she is complicit in their nasty deeds because she takes their questionably-sourced coin. As Editor. She offers encouragement to the underdogs, and may alter rules if she feels one side has a particular advantage. She is uninterested in the crowd’s opinion. Her APPENDIX A: NPCS AND MONSTERS 43 compassion means she rarely orders death to downed combatants, though she is less kind to any combatant she believes takes pleasure in killing. Story Ideas. Gertrude might request some prisoners to clean up after a particularly violent or messy night in the tavern, and she might request humans prisoners specifically. If Gertrude gets to know and like the PCs, she may gift them small luxuries like food or even just temporary respite from prison conditions. Her family members would not approve of such association with the prisoners, so she’s likely to be secretive about it. Ultimately, the PCs may be able to convince her to assist in their escape, potentially to the point where she abandons her family and becomes an NPC Party Member (DMG92) at the end of the adventure.

(PHB97) During her first turn, Gillian has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit Gillian scores against a surprised creature (PHB189) is a critical hit. Cunning Action (1/Turn). (PHB96) Gillian can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action (PHB192). Dual Wielder. (PHB165) Gillian gains a +1 bonus to AC while she wields two longswords, one in each hand (this is included in the AC above). She may use two weapon fighting (PHB195) with longswords, even though they are not light. She may draw or stow both longswords when she would normally be able to draw or stow only one. Sneak Attack (1/Turn). (PHB96) Gillian deals an extra 7 (2d6) damage when she hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Gillian that isn’t incapacitated and Gillian doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. ACTIONS Multiattack. Gillian makes two longsword attacks, one with each hand. Longsword (Main Hand). Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage. Longsword (Off Hand). Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d8) slashing damage. EQUIPMENT AND TREASURE Two longswords, (PHB149), fine clothes, vial of perfume (PHB150), a key to room [5N], Individual Treasure: Challenge 0 – 4 (DMG136) (roll twice). Gillian Greger is Gladwin’s wife and business partner. A tall, lean and athletic human woman with long waves of red hair. She wears a curious combination of loose, full-length dress and leather armour. Two longswords dangle from her belt. Mannerisms. She speaks in a loud, melodic voice. She is fond of bawdy jokes and double entendres. Interaction Traits. She is a confident, playful conversationalist. Ideal. Part hedonist, part narcissist, all socialite. She wants to live the high life and be noticed and respected by everyone. Bond. She is dedicated to her family. Flaw. She is easily bored. She can turn nasty when she doesn’t get her way, especially if there are no witnesses around to see her less-than-charming side. As Editor. She excels in creating and building drama over the happenings in the arena. She craves the crowd’s approval, and can be beholden to their fickle desires. Story Ideas. Gillian loves to show off, and she has no qualms using prisoners to this end. If any of the PCs have any sort of crowd appeal – from their reputation in the arena or other extraordinary qualities – she may summon them to social events to be “displayed”. If the PCs prove themselves useful in this regard, Gillian may grant them special privileges and go easy on them in the arena.

Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage. Rapier. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

Gladwin Greger is the head of the Greger family. The grotto is named after his ancestors. A bald human male with a thick black beard, tall and barrel-chested. His outfit combines the fine clothing of a nobleman with the colourful trimmings and polished breastplate of a buccaneer. Mannerisms. He speaks in a booming, almost operatic, voice. Interaction Traits. His hospitality pervades his whole character: he is gracious, flattering and jocular even with his enemies. When he becomes truly angry, though, he speaks plainly. Ideal. He combines business with pleasure; he seeks to amass wealth and security but would rather do it through honest dealings and mutual benefit. He is a man of his word. Bond. He is determined to provide for his family at all costs. Flaw. His anger is extreme; he becomes violent and irrational (though not indiscriminate). Normally very slow to anger, there are two “short-cuts” that push his buttons: harm to his family (including the family wealth) and treachery. As Editor. Gladwin is quite generous to the prisoners, preferring to keep them alive where feasible. He has enough respect from the crowd to get away with bending the rules on the fly, which he will do to save lives. One thing he does not tolerate well is cheating, especially from longer-term prisoners. He will order harsh punishments for anyone caught. Story Ideas. The PCs’ escape plan may be bloody and violent, with them storming their way out. In such a scenario Gladwin will let Drusus Skull-Skewer and his guards handle the situation first. But if it appears they’re likely to fail, Gladwin might attempt to raise a militia of independents (see Part 5), most probably by promising them coin. It’s better that he be in debt than lose all his money-generating prisoners or even the grotto itself. He’ll use his makeshift army as a last stand – you should ensure its size is a suitable challenge for the PCs.

Godrick is a 3rd-level spellcaster that uses Charisma as his spellcasting ability (spell save DC12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). Godrick has the following spells prepared from the sorcerer spell list: Cantrips (at will): blade ward (PHB218), light (PHB255), mending (PHB259), ray of frost (PHB271) 1st level (4 slots): charm person (PHB221), ray of sickness (PHB271) 2nd level (2 slots): mirror image (PHB260), phantasmal force (PHB264) Wild Magic Surge. (PHB103) Immediately after Godrick casts a spell of 1st level of higher, roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table (PHB104) to create a random magical effect. ACTIONS Quarterstaff. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage, or 5 (1d8 + 1) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack. EQUIPMENT AND TREASURE Arcane focus staff (PHB149), robe (PHB150), Individual Treasure: Challenge 0 – 4 (DMG136). Godrick Greger is the adult son of the Gladwin family. He is a self-taught magic-user, and is somewhat reclusive and eccentric. A tall, thin young man with a thick black beard and closely-shaven head. He wears a simple black robe. Mannerisms. He rarely speaks, and when he does he uses as few words as possible. Interaction Traits. He is blunt and often rude. He uses insults as a way to avoid conversation, but also because he enjoys them. Ideal. He believes in his own importance wants others to see it too. Bond. He thinks only of himself: every one else is unimportant. Flaw. He’s unsatisfied with his current life, and is having trouble figuring out how to improve it. He hurts others (when he can get away with it) for a sense of power. As Editor. He is cruel, and loves to cause misery to those in the arena. His cruelty is tempered only by the thought of his father’s anger should he take things too far. He does not care much for the crowd’s whims, though he lacks the courage to make them furious. Story Ideas. Godrick’s interest in magic may mean his attention is drawn to magic-using PCs. He is especially interested in formal places of magic learning (academies, schools, temples) which he was denied due to life in a criminal family. He may develop the delusion all that stands between him and greatness as a magic-user is a little bit of formal curricula. Being an unsavoury sort, Godrick may threaten nasty punishments to a magic-using PC or her friends if co- operation isn’t forthcoming. On the other hand, Godrick may develop a genuine (and for him, rare) friendship with his “tutor” if the relationship is more amiable. Being somewhat lost in life, Godrick’s ambitions could easily be shaped by a strong mentor. Godrick could wind up being an NPC Party Member (DMG92) suitable for neutral- or evil-aligned parties. APPENDIX A: NPCS AND MONSTERS 46 HAGUUR Medium humanoid (orog), neutral Armour Class 16 (shield) Hit Points 31 (2d12 + 18) Speed 30 ft.

As a bonus action, Haguur can move up to his speed toward a hostile creature that he can see. Danger Sense. (PHB48) Haguur gains advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects he can see. Reckless Attack. (PHB48) Haguur may gain advantage on a melee weapon attack roll using Strength. If Haguur opts to use this, all attack rolls against him have advantage until his next turn. Totem Spirit, Bear. (PHB50) While raging Haguur gains resistance (PHB197) to all damage except psychic damage. ACTIONS Mace. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage. Unarmed. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 3 bludgeoning damage. Rage (x3, Recharges after a Long Rest). (PHB48) Haguur may enter a barbarian rage as a bonus action. Long ago, Haguur was a wandering sell-sword. At some point he crossed the wrong people and ended up in slavery. The first thing you notice about this orc prisoner is his hair. Jet-black and long, it has formed into thick dreadlocks both from his scalp and beard. Cold, steady eyes stare out from beneath this dark mane. His muscled body is more wiry than hulking. Mannerisms. Still and stoic, he seems always calm and without emotion. Interaction Traits. He speaks only when necessary, and with few words as will suffice. His tone is always flat. Ideal. Revenge and freedom, in that order. Haguur wishes to kill everyone involved in the slavery business – even those tangentially related. His fellow prisoners are not considered targets because they, too, are victims. Bond. Almost counter-dependent, he prefers a solitary wanderer’s lifestyle, only dealing with others out of necessity. He tolerates being the “leader” of the orc prisoners but feels no special obligation to them. Flaw. He is anti-social and uncharismatic, and incapable of deception or flattery. He holds no special regard for the lives of others, and while he does not slay others without cause, he can kill with a chilling ease. Story Ideas. Haguur makes a potential ally for the PCs. He is skilled in combat, and reliable enough to follow a plan. But his utter lack of charisma could derail any scheme involving deception. While Haguur and the PCs share a common goal in escape, they may oppose his ideas for revenge. Haguur will wish to slay everyone in the Grotto who isn’t a prisoner. He will not hide this fact from the PCs if the topic arises, but won’t mention it otherwise. Whether the bloody truth emerges in the planning or execution of an escape, the PCs may become conflicted about supporting such an ally. (Haguur’s desire for revenge does not override his sense of self-preservation. If he cannot realistically kill everyone immediately, he will attempt to escape so he might return at a later date.) Optionally, you may allow Haguur’s cold, heartless nature to be warmed by the PC’s actions. Can they show him the benefits of friendship and teamwork? If they can, Haguur could be a potential NPC party member (DMG92) or contact (DMG93); you may need to rework Haguur’s Ideal and Bond to reflect a new outlook on life. Weapons. Prisoners are generally unarmed. A variety of weapons are presented here for arena combat. Don’t forget to remove the AC bonus for a shield if you choose a two-handed weapon.

(PHB96) Harry deals an extra 7 (2d6) damage when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Harry that isn’t incapacitated and Harry doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. ACTIONS Rapier. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage. Bags of Tricks. Harry carries a number of items that may be useful in combat (see equipment, below). EQUIPMENT AND TREASURE Rapier (PHB149), leather armour (PHB150), traveller’s clothes (PHB150), Potion of healing (PHB153), bag of ball bearings, bag of caltrops (PHB151), flask of oil (PHB152), thieves’ tools (PHB154), dice set (PHB154), key to the general store [5G], key to the chest in his quarters [5V], Individual Treasure: Challenge 0 – 4 (DMG136) (roll twice). Harry Dodds is a merchant and criminal black marketeer. He runs the Grotto’s general store but dreams of greater things. He is a big gambler and frequent spectator of arena games, where he typically bets away any profit made from his store. A human male, just entering into middle age, dressed to a style but without great expense. He bears a grin that is equal parts sly and jovial. Mannerisms. He has a habit of grinning and joking, even when it is not appropriate. Interaction Traits. Lacking in self-confidence, he compensates by being cheerful and always willing to joke. He is quite charming. Ideal. He believes in living an adventurous and hedonistic lifestyle, and seeks to elevate himself in any way that gets him more of this. Bond. He feels tied to the criminal world that tolerated him when civilised society wouldn’t. Flaw. He is impulsive and has an addictive personality. Most notably, he is a problem gambler. Story Ideas. Dodds may see potential in the PCs as arena champions and bet heavily on them. Mounting winnings (or increasing debts) may inspire Dodds to do anything to ensure his team wins; including but not limited to smuggling equipment, giving advice, swaying opinions of the spectators and/or the editor. Assume Dodds has paid off a small number of guards to help in such plans. While Drusus’ hobgoblin guards are too professional to neglect their duty as prison guards, a few can be bribed to do “harmless” things, like smuggling small packages or arranging secret visits. Dodds might not not reveal his identity to the PCs – he could be an anonymous benefactor. If he does make himself known, the PCs may wish to bargain: maybe they can get Dodds to help them with an eventual escape? Of course, Dodds’ schemes, if discovered, could attract the ire of the Greger family or Drusus Skull-Skewer.

JISTHELEK THE GRASPING Small humanoid (goblinoid), chaotic neutral Armour Class 13 Hit Points 17 (2d8 + 8) Speed 30 ft.

(PHB96) Jisthelek can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action (PHB192). Sneak Attack (1/Turn). (PHB96) Jisthelek deals an extra 7 (2d6) damage when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Jisthelek that isn’t incapacitated and Jisthelek doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. ACTIONS Dagger. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. Unarmed. Melee Weapon Attack: -2 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 1 bludgeoning damage. Jisthelek the Grasping was the gang leader of a small but fairly effective criminal gang until his scheme against a pirate gang went awry. He avoided death by convincing his captors that another member of his gang was the leader; as a mere accomplice he was sold into slavery instead. This goblin has an ornate tattoo of various symbols and letters that covers much of his torso and right shoulder. He wears a grin; it’s hard to decide if it’s merry or malicious. APPENDIX A: NPCS AND MONSTERS 49 Mannerisms. He is seemingly always happy; always grinning and quick to laugh. He talks quickly and is often making jokes of mixed quality. Interaction Traits. He rarely gives straight answers. He is street-smart, cunning, deceptive and manipulative. Ideal. Always positive, he believes comedy and mirth can be extracted from any situation. Even imprisonment. He is something of a prankster, and his tastes can wander into the macabre. Bond. He cares only for himself, though this is not always apparent as his cheerful manner can look like friendship. Unlike other goblins, he does not feel any special deference to hobgoblins (though he may pretend otherwise). Flaw. Unlike most of his kin, he is largely unaffected by fear. He doesn’t exactly have a death-wish, but he will needlessly skirt with danger. Tattoos. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana), (History) or (Religion) can identify Jisthelek’s tattoos. They are arcane markings to ward against magic, illness, bad luck and various other maladies. They’re from a wide range of sources and practices and have been artfully added to over the years. By default, the tattoos have no actual powers, though you could always override this. Perhaps give Jisthelek some luck points as per the Lucky feat (PHB167)? Story Ideas. Jisthelek’s roguish talents and seemingly friendly attitude may make him an ally of the PCs. Jisthelek will gladly go along with such efforts and will even seem like a solid ally. But when he spies an opportunity to “prank” the PCs he will do so. For example, he might lock them in a room, attract the attention of extra guards, trip them up in combat, or purposefully misdirect them into dangerous situations. (While he has no problem with endangering the PCs, or even himself to a small degree, he won’t do a prank that will get himself killed.) If confronted about these pranks, he will lie and concoct an excuse. If there’s no plausible excuse, he will go with an absurd one for his own amusement. Weapons. A variety of weapons are presented here for arena combat. While in prison, Jisthelek usually keeps a stolen dagger hidden about his person.

APPENDIX A: NPCS AND MONSTERS 50 XANTHE JONQUIL Medium humanoid (human), neutral good Armour Class 10 Hit Points 11 (2d8 + 2) Speed 30 ft.

Xanthe is a 3rd level spellcaster that uses Wisdom as her spellcasting ability (spell save DC13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). Xanthe has the following spells prepared from the cleric spell list: Cantrips (at will): light, mending, spare the dead 1st level (4 slots): bless, create or destroy water, cure wounds, detect poison and disease, purify food and drink 2nd level (2 slots): calm emotions, lesser restoration, prayer of healing Disciple of Life.

(PHB60) Xanthe can Channel Divinity to restore hit points. EQUIPMENT AND TREASURE Ragged clothes, holy symbol amulet (PHB151). Xanthe Jonquil, an elderly human cleric, is the kindly leader of the human clique of prisoners. An elderly human lady, frail and stooping but still projecting an air of confidence. She wears her long grey hair in a ponytail. Mannerisms. She fidgets with her holy symbol. Interaction Traits. She is polite, well-spoken, confident and always calm. She is prone to giving unwanted advice to the point of nagging. Ideal. She dislikes taking life or causing injury unless absolutely necessary. Bond. She feel responsible for the group of prisoners she leads. She attempts to minimise their suffering and ideally would like to see them free. She may recognise the PCs as her best hope and hint that (or later outright entreat that) they should plan an escape. Flaw. Her desire to heal the injured sometimes overcomes pragmatic reason. She may heal unfriendly prisoners, stabilise hostiles, and seek peaceful alternatives even at increased risk. Spellcasting. Xanthe has a holy symbol and is able to cast spells. She keeps her full spell-casting abilities secret from everyone outside the human group. Other prisoners are aware of her healing “skills” and in exceptional circumstances may request or demand treatment. Xanthe may give her holy symbol to the PCs if she trusts them enough.
