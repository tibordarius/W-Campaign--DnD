{"path":"Whale campaign/A Structure/Side-Quests/Small Encounters 0 - 2 Hours/1253440-RandomEncountersExpanded.pdf","text":"Introduction L ife is a series of encounters. Many are small and random, some are weighted with an importance that makes them seem fated, and fewer still are world-shaking enough to change a person utterly. In this supplement you will find examples of each of these encounters, each with its own flavour and significance. How to use this document This supplement is designed to be used in three key ways: Firstly, DMs can use this to generate location-specific combat encounters and interesting side notes on-the-fly. If you need an encounter quickly, just roll a die and look up a result in the 'Combat: Locales' or 'Non-Combat: Minor Events' sections, where readymade encounters are waiting for your players to engage in. Secondly, this supplement contains a repository of more complex encounters, particularly in the 'Combat: Hordes' and 'Major Events' sections. Though these can also be determined randomly, you may wish to take more time in working them into your campaign or adventure more smoothly. Finally, you might use the encounters narrated here as inspiration for larger adventures. The detailed characters in the 'Combat: Duels' section or the original settings in the 'Non-Combat: Communities' chapter could all be used as hooks for your next quest. Cannibalise the information here as you see fit. Please note that this document assumes you have access to the stat blocks from the Monster Manual and Volo's Guide to Monsters. Random encounters and how to use them The best thing about random encounters is their versatility. They can rescue a flagging quest session, revive a long- standing grudge between a player and a villain, or even catapult the party into a completely new adventure. Random encounters are particularly useful for giving players a sense of the progression of time as they travel or sleep. They can also provide a feeling of danger, making the return to the relative saftey of a civilised town feel like a real relief. Most importantly, they can be used to reward players for imaginative and intelligent play, or to punish them for being stupid. The wizard forgot to cast alarm when he went to bed? Random encounter. The rogue had too much to drink, so his passive Perception is too low? Random encounter. One player has been talking for two hours about the intricacies of exactly how his character prepared a beef stew? You guessed it. It's random encounter time. Mega-table Those that believe in free will, beware! This mega-table reduces all encounters in this supplement to the roll of a few dice. If you want the zaniest time of your life, use this with reckless abandon. For a more tailored experience, read through the entire supplement first.

What are those shadows that flicker across the foliage in the half- light? And what's causing that subtle scent of sulphur? Too late do you realise the hulking thing that slinks towards you... Provided below are a set of tables for calculating how many creatures should be present in an encounter, depending on the number and level of the players involved. However, this method assumes that you only utilise creatures of the same Challenge Rating. For random encounters with creatures of variable CRs, see the 'Combat: Hordes' section of this supplement. How to use these tables Determining the number of creatures. First, determine which creature you will be using, then find its CR on the table. Look along to the Level your players are; for each player of that level, use the number listed. For example, if we wanted a random encounter of some hobgoblins (CR 1/2) for our party of three 3rd level players, we could look at the first table (Lvl.1-5) to discover that 3 hobgoblins would be an appropriate encounter size. Such an encounter would be of a (roughly) Medium or Hard difficulty. Sometimes die rolls are used to provide further randomness to the difficulty of the encounter; the lowest number will produce an Easy encounter, whilst the highest will produce a Deadly encounter. Creatures requiring more than one player. Some of the more difficult creatures require more than one player to defeat; in this case, the number of players required is listed instead of the number of creatures per player, and this is denoted by the letter P (e.g. one giant spider would probably need three 2nd level characters to defeat, so it is marked 3P). If a creature would require more than five players to defeat, it is marked with a dash; it is not recommeded that you use this creature unless you want to seriously challenge your players. Creatures up to CR 15 are listed here, as it is assumed that creatures beyond this level of difficulty will be hand-placed by the DM, rather than being determined randomly. Parties with players of different levels. As long as the creature chosen does not require more than one player to defeat (as denoted by the letter P, explained above) it is quite easy to build balanced encounters using these tables even when the party is comprised of players of different levels. For example, let's say we have a party with two 5th level characters and one 7th level character. They'll be facing some giant eagles (CR 1). Looking at the first table, we can see that the two 5th level characters can deal with two giant eagles each; the second table shows us that our 7th level character can deal with anything from one to four giant eagles. Let's say we roll 1d4 and score a 3. Adding everything up, an appropriate encounter would consist of five giant eagles. Sorted! Dealing with tough creatures. Consider providing temporary NPCs (such as the Priest, Knight or Druid NPCs provided in the Monster Manual) to aid the players when attempting to defeat a particularly challenging enemy. Alternatively, roll on the Combat: Locales section below and use whatever creature is randomly selected, even if the creature is far above the players' capabilities. Realising how much weaker the players are in comparison to it, the creature might completely ignore them, or you could use it to teach the players a swift lesson in how to run away. Sometimes unbalanced encounters are just as interesting as those that are closely matched in skill.

Examples of such groups are detailed below and organised into common types of enemies. Each horde is tailored to a set of players levels (1-5, 6-10, 11-15, and 16-20). As such, the hordes will generally be of a Medium difficulty to the higher levels in the range, a Hard difficulty to the middle section of the range, and a Deadly difficulty to the lowest end of the range. Furthermore, these hordes assume a party size of 3-4; you may need to adjust the number of enemies in the horde, or add NPC characters, to balance these encounters if you have larger or smaller parties. Select the type of horde you want, or determine it randomly using the table below. 1 d8 Type 1 Bandits 2 Goblinoids 3 Orcs 4 Gnolls 5 Undead 6 Kobolds 7 Lizardfolk 8 Acolytes Bandits They lurk in abandoned towers, enforce ludicrous tolls on backwater bridges, and sometimes gain enough swagger to send the town guard cowering. Wherever they're found, bandits are ruthless, dangerous, and often stupid. This particular group of bandits is led by a fierce veteran of the highwayman's trade, a human by the name of Brindar Ironwater. Brindar has been at the head of multiple bandit gangs that have risen in prominence, been decimated, and risen again from the ashes under a different name. His current band is known as Bearstooth. Levels 1 -5 At these levels, the Bearstooth band consists of: • One bandit captain (Brindar Ironwater) • Five bandits Brindar is middle-aged, but looks older due to his numerous scars and hair that has turned grey with experience. His Bearstooth lackeys are much younger and lack the experience and confidence of their leader. Motives. The bandits desire wealth, women and whiskey in outrageous quantities, and they're prepared to do almost anything to get it. Flaws. Being essentially selfish people, the bandits are almost always a hair's breadth away from turning on each other. Without an iron fist to rule them, they'd quickly fall apart. Tactics. Brindar is a fearless but shrewd warrior, and he knows that jumping straight into battle before anyone expects it can swiftly solve a problem - but it also carries risks. Generally the bandits will attack first and ask questions later, but if the captain fears they'll lose, he has no qualms about sounding a retreat. If Brindar falls, the remaining bandits won't stick around for long. Levels 6 - 1 0 At these levels, the Bearstooth band consists of: • Two bandit captains (Brindar Ironwater & lieutenant) • Eight bandits • Four mastiffs Brindar has attracted more followers by this point, and has even promoted one of them to be his right hand man, revealing certain veteran skills to him. In addition, the Bearstooth have captured and trained some mastiffs to serve as guards and attack dogs. They also gain: Extra Tactics. Both Brindar and the lieutenant must now fall before the rest of the bandits will consider fleeing. Four of the bandits control the mastiffs, but, because of their poor treatment, the animals are just as likely to turn on their masters than attack the bandits' foes. Levels 1 1 - 1 5 At these levels, the Bearstooth band consists of: • One veteran (Brindar Ironwater) • Four bandit captains (lieutenants) • Eight bandits • Four mastiffs Brindar's skills have attained the level of a veteran soldier, and he has trained up more of the bandits to serve as lieutenants. They also gain: Extra Motives. Having grown in size and power, the Bearstooth now seek more sustainable and profitable enterprises like political blackmail and racketeering. In addition, the benefits of gaining Brindar's favour have meant that many bandits will now attempt feats of bravery and initiative to win his attention. 8 Levels 1 6 - 2 0 At these levels, the Bearstooth band consists of: • One gladiator (Brindar Ironwater) • Eight bandit captains (lieutenants) • Twelve bandits • Eight mastiffs Brindar's skills have become legendary, and he has a whole vanguard of well-trained lieutenants. They also gain: Extra Tactics. The Bearstooth now have enough men to organise proper full-scale raids. The bandit captains charge in first, flanked by their trusty mastiff pets, whilst the weaker bandits sneak around to flank with bows and daggers. Through it all, the fearsome figure of Brindar Ironwater can be seen, wading through the bodies of his enemies. Goblinoids Known throughout the land as petty thieves, troublesome ambushers and, occasionally, savage warbands, the various races of the goblinoid menace can be found in every dank corner you care to look in. The unpleasant pack presented here are the loathsome Bittering Brothers, a bickering family of runtish goblins. Levels 1 -5 At these levels, the goblinoids consist of: • Five goblins • Two wolves The Brothers are constantly arguing with one another, and can only work together when they need to protect themselves or secure their next meal. Motives. The goblins eek out a meagre existance by ambushing weak animals and, when they pluck up the courage, passing traders. When they get the chance to, they love humiliating anything weaker than themselves. Flaws. Aside from their natural stupidity, these particular goblins also suffer from the bickering nature of young siblings that spend too much time together. They can rarely work in symphony with one another. Tactics. The Brothers survive by stalking their prey, working out its weaknesses, and ambushing it when it's unprepared. Even once a fight has begun they will constantly retreat to the shadows to try and attack their enemies from behind, believing (rightly) that they often have little hope in open combat. If an opponent proves too powerful, they will quickly and unceremoniously retreat. Levels 6 -1 0 At these levels, the goblinoids consist of: • Four goblins • Three wolves • One goblin boss • Three bugbears Three bugbears have been able to bully the Bittering Brothers into serving them, and have lavished one of the brothers with special attention to get him to control the rest of his siblings. The group gains: Extra Motives. The goblins now seek to impress their bugbear masters, whilst the bugbears hope to gain as much food as possible with as little effort as possible. Extra Tactics. The bugbears use their naturally stealthy abilities (and their new goblin scapegoats) to attack larger and more well-defended targets in their hunt for food. Levels 1 1 -1 5 At these levels, the goblinoids consist of: • Eight goblins • Four wolves • Five bugbears • Four hobgoblins • One hobgoblin captain The ragtag band of goblins and bugbears have been subsumed into a larger, more well-organised group by a tough team of hobgoblins. The group gains: Extra Motives. Under the influence of the hobgoblins, the group now bends its efforts into wreaking havoc in the name of Maglubiyet. Extra Tactics. The group are now more akin to a fine-tuned fighting machine than a simple band of thieves. Once the bugbears use stealth to ambush the enemy, the goblins provide ranged flanking attacks whilst the hobgoblins charge into the fray as a frightening wave of steel and blood-red eyes. Levels 1 6 -2 0 At these levels, the goblinoids consist of: • Ten goblins • Six wolves • Eight bugbears • Eight hobgoblins • One hobgoblin warlord These goblinoids have attained the power and control that most followers of Maglubiyet can only dream of. 9 Orcs Ruthless in their lifelong quest of pleasing the iron will of Gruumsh, orcs are feared in every village and homestead for the powerful wake of destruction they can leave in their path as they search for opponents to test their mettle against. The orcs here are outcasts from their tribe, and they roam the wilds relentlessly, looking for a suitable challenge to prove their worth once more. Levels 1 -5 At these levels, the orcs consist of: • Four orcs These orcs are particularly ruthless, and will attack anything they come across. Motives. To regain the honour of their tribe, the orcs must defeat suitably powerful enemies. As such, they will ignore weaker creaturs and pursue those that they believe to be worth their time. Flaws. With such unbridled fury, the orcs are at risk of easily falling into traps or being decieved by wily players. Tactics. The orcs throw caution to the wind, attacking in a relentless barrage of blows to overpower their enemies. They will often try to draw out individual opponents to prove their skills against. Levels 6 -1 0 At these levels, the orcs consist of: • Six orcs • One orc war chief (Guranesh) The orcs have been accepted into a larger group, under the control of a powerful chieftain called Guranesh. They also gain: Extra Motives. Now that they are more organised, the orcs raid villages and towns to spread the glory of Gruumsh. They target goblinoids and elves in particular. Extra Tactics. The orcs are more likely to work in pairs or threes now to surround their enemies and overwhelm them. Levels 1 1 -1 5 At these levels, the orcs consist of: • Ten orcs • One orc war chief (Guranesh) • One orc Claw of Luthic • One orc Hand of Yurtus • One orc Eye of Gruumsh Guranesh has expanded his clan, ordering specific orcs to train into specialist roles to serve the various gods in the orc pantheon. They also gain: Extra Tactics. The Claw of Luthic, Hand of Yurtus, and Eye of Gruumsh have two ordinary orcs to guard them as they move about the battlefield, whilst the remaining four guard Guranesh. All three of the lieutenants will rush to the chieftain's aid if necessary. Levels 1 6 -2 0 At these levels, the orcs consist of: • Ten orcs • One orc war chief (Guranesh) • Two orc Claws of Luthic • Two orc Hands of Yurtus • One orc Eye of Gruumsh • One orc Blade of Ilneval Guranesh's tribe can now be rightly called an army, with battle drums that strike fear across the land. They also gain: Extra Tactics. The Blade of Ilneval now commands the ten ordinary orcs into battle, whilst the Claws of Luthic, Hands of Yurtus and Eye of Gruumsh remain at the back of the main force, guarding their glorious chieftain. 10 Gnolls Little is safe from the sweeping wave of the gnolls once they begin to cascade across nations. Survivors know that fleeing forever is one's best chance of surviving their feral hunt. This warband is small, but its fierce devotion to Yeenoghu knows no bounds. Levels 1 -5 At these levels, the warband consists of: • Four gnolls These gnolls have managed to escape a recent culling which decimated most of their pack, but their hunger for destruction is as insatiable as ever. Motives. Gnolls want nothing more than to feast on the flesh of intelligent creatures, and this pack is no different. They seek out the weakest creatures to hunt down and destroy, caring little for the treasure that most other creatures would desire. Flaws. Without any real leadership to guide them, these gnolls are susceptible to being drawn into a trap or being decieved into believing fake, simple illusions as important signs from Yeenoghu. Tactics. The gnolls try to be stealthy wherever possible to avoid civilised folk from raising the alarm. They will target the weakest creatures they find, preferring to avoid larger and more powerful groups unless they think they can overwhelm them through brute force. Levels 6 -1 0 At these levels, the warband consists of: • Eight gnolls • Two gnoll hunters • One gnoll pack lord One of the gnolls has proven itself stronger and more intelligent than all the rest, and has begun to separate the gnolls into different, more specialised roles. They also gain: Extra Tactics. The gnolls are now able to fight larger and stronger prey, with the main force bearing down all their might whilst the hunters slink around the edges of the battlefield, picking off weaker creatures with ranged attacks. Levels 1 1 -1 5 At these levels, the warband consists of: • Twelve gnolls • Four gnoll hunters • Four gnoll flesh gnawers • One gnoll pack lord Their path of destruction has borne even more hungry gnolls, some of which have become so ravenous that they throw all thought of caution to the wind. They also gain: Extra Tactics. The larger hunter group is now able to scout out potential prey, whilst the flesh gnawers can use their relentless melee attacks to rush even more powerful creatures. Levels 1 6 -2 0 At these levels, the warband consists of: • Twelve gnolls • Six gnoll hunters • Five gnoll flesh gnawers • Two gnoll Fangs of Yeenoghu • One gnoll pack lord Yeenoghu has blessed this pack, granting two of the gnolls the power to spread His hunger at an even greater rate. They also gain: Extra Tactics. The warband now has the numbers to attack even large towns, washing through them like a wave of disease and destruction. The Fangs of Yeenoghu are a particular menance, causing even more gnolls to spring from the path they leave behind. 11 Undead Wherever acts of unspeakable cruetly are committed, wherever necromancers gather to practice their dark arts, wherever a soul is left with unfinished business - there you will find the various shambling forms of the dreaded undead. This motley horde of undead was created by a necromancer called Ruz'atru (you can find him in the Duels chapter below), and now they roam the wilds looking for their master. Levels 1 -5 At these levels, the horde consists of: • Four skeletons • Three zombies In various states of decay, these undead followers only want to find their master and satiate their hunger for flesh along the way. Motives. This horde has no sentience to speak of, so they have little motivation beyond following their instinctive pull towards their creator and the usual hunger for live flesh that drives most undead. Flaws. Being stupid and slow, this horde is particularly easy to ambush. Tactics. The skeletons, maintaining a few fragments of knowledge from their past lives, are able to flank their enemies and use shortbows to weaken them, whilst the zombies charge forward relentlessly in a tide of flesh-eating hunger. Levels 6 -1 0 At these levels, the horde consists of: • Five skeletons • Five zombies • Three ghouls • One ghast Ruz'atru's creations have been joined by a group of ghouls, led by a powerful ghast, all bent to the same goal: the feasting of flesh. They also gain: Extra Tactics. As a larger group, the horde is now dimly aware that it can overwhelm those stronger than it by charging all at once. Levels 1 1 -1 5 At these levels, the horde consists of: • Seven skeletons • Seven zombies • Five ghouls • One ghast • One wight The horde has grown, and has come under the control of a powerful wight who used to be a respected soldier, but made a deal with a demon to avoid death. Its version of immortality is not quite what it expected it would be. They also gain: Extra Motives. The wight is filled with rage against the living world it has only half-departed from, and so it leads the lesser undead to attack stronger foes in its hope of bringing about great destruction. Extra Tactics. The wight provides the horde with a modicum of tactics, and will use the speed of the ghouls to rush enemies whilst the zombies lumber after them and the skeletons use ranged weapons to attack the flanks. Levels 1 6 -2 0 At these levels, the horde consists of: • Seven skeletons • Seven zombies • Five ghouls • Three ghasts • One wight • One beholder zombie The horde has flocked around a mighty example of their kind: a beholder zombie. Following this despotic undead, the horde carves a path of disease and desctruction across the land. They also gain: Extra Tactics. The wight commands the skeletons, given their slightly higher intelligence, whilst the ghouls follow the ghasts into battle. The zombies shamble around wherever the beholder zombie goes, certain that fresh flesh will soon drop to their feet if they do so. 12 Kobolds Emboldened by an arrogant sense of heritage from their distant dragon ancestors, kobolds flock in great numbers to worship their more powerful cousins and swarm anything that should try to harm their masters. These particular kobolds are on the hunt for a dragon master to serve. Levels 1 -5 At these levels, the horde consists of: • Six kobolds • Three winged kobolds The kobolds are constantly searching for signs of dragons, and hold an irrational belief that a dragon is always watching them and waiting to see if they are worthy. Motives. The kobolds jump on any evidence of a dragon presence, and they also believe that if they cause enough mischief or kill enough powerful creatures, a mystical dragon that is 'watching' them will scoop them up and make them its servants. Flaws. Their fervour for dragon evidence makes them particularly susceptible to deception. Tactics. The kobolds know they are weak individually, so they will stick close together and try to cut their foes off into smaller groups to they can overwhelm them. The winged kobolds fly above the battlefield and drop rocks on distracted enemies. Levels 6 -1 0 At these levels, the horde consists of: • Ten kobolds • Eight winged kobolds • One kobold scale sorcerer • One kobold dragonshield The kobolds have found some real evidence of dragons, a few shed scales, which a couple have used to bolster their fighting prowess and take control of the horde. They gain: Extra Tactics. The kobold dragonshield now leads the normal kobolds into battle as a furious wave of claws and steel, whilst the scale sorcerer commands the winged kobolds from afar, raining down its draconic magic. Levels 1 1 -1 5 At these levels, the horde consists of: • Twelve kobolds • Ten winged kobolds • Six kobold inventors • Five kobold scale sorcerers • Three kobold dragonshields The kobolds have managed to gain the patronage of a moderately powerful black dragon, and as such their numbers and skills have grown immensely. They gain: Extra Motives. Now that they have found a dragon master, the kobolds' aim is simply to please their patron in whatever way they can. Usually this means going out into the world to search for treasure to bring back to the hoard. Extra Tactics. There are enough of the kobolds now to split into smaller groups to outmanoeuver their enemies. A kobold dragonshield each commands four ordinary kobolds and two kobold inventors, whilst the scale sorcerers take two winged kobolds each. In these fireteams, the kobolds surround their enemies and cut off their retreat before closing in as one huge, terrifying mass. Levels 1 6 -2 0 At these levels, the horde consists of: • Twelve kobolds • Ten winged kobolds • Six kobold inventors • Five kobold scale sorcerers • Three kobold dragonshields • One young black dragon Much to their delight, the kobolds are now joined in battle by their dragon master. They gain: Extra Tactics. Though they still operate in smaller groups, the kobolds now flock around their patron and focus mainly on defending the black dragon as it lays waste to everything around it. 13 Lizardfolk Slinking through water and mud, the scheming minds of the lizardfolk are never at rest. Be it for food, funds or simply fun, these amphibious attackers are a troublesome bunch no matter where you find them. This trio of lizardfolk are the only survivors of their tribe, having been ousted from their swampy territory by an encroaching ancient black dragon, which scorned the lizardfolk's attempts to ally with it. Now they roam the wilds in search of a new home, attacking anything they percieve as a threat to their existence. Levels 1 -5 At these levels, the horde consists of: • Three lizardfolk The lizardfolk are not likely to enter combat if they don't need to, but they will be swift and brutal in their attacks if they suspect they are under threat. Motives. At this point the lizardfolk simply want to find an appropriate marsh or swamp in which they can settle down and begin to rebuild their hunting ground. Flaws. Their nervousness makes them skittish, so they are inclined to attack first and ask questions later if they sense something is awry. Tactics. The lizardfolk make use of traps and subterfuge to overcome their enemies, and will sooner flee than risk the last memory of their tribe dying with them. Levels 6 -1 0 At these levels, the horde consists of: • Three lizardfolk • Five giant lizards Though they still search for a suitable home, the lizardfolk have managed to capture and train some giant lizards to serve as guards. They also gain: Extra Tactics. The lizardfolk now use their giant lizard pets to weaken enemies, allowing the group to grow bolder in their attempts to attack others. Levels 1 1 -1 5 At these levels, the horde consists of: • Four lizardfolk • Five giant lizards • One lizardfolk shaman For their perseverance, one of the lizardfolk has been blessed by Semuanya, gaining magical abilities and drawing a few other lizardfolk stragglers to the group. They also gain: Extra Tactics. The lizardfolk shaman is now able to command the lizardfolk and giant lizards in a more organised manner, allowing them to take on stronger and more well- defended enemies in their hunt for a new home. Levels 1 6 -2 0 At these levels, the horde consists of: • Ten lizardfolk • One lizardfolk king One of the lizardfolk has been touched by Sess'innek, turning it into a powerful creature that has killed Semuanya's shaman and now bends the will of the tribe to evil ends. They also gain: Extra Motives. Due to the demonic influence of Sess'innek, the lizardfolk no longer care for settling down: they are content to rampage across the wilds, seeking more and more power and wealth. Extra Tactics. The lizardfolk now attack on sight, not caring for the finer points of stealth. The lizardfolk king leads the charge, using its immense strength to overwhelm any that stand in the lizardfolk's way. 14 Acolytes Committed to developing their magical skills, particularly to impress some powerful mage, deity or demon, acolytes often form small sects to practice spells and carry out experiments away from prying eyes, and there's often a gruesome reason for their well-guarded secrecy. The acolytes detailed here call themselves The Hand That Sees, and emblazon their robes with the image of a palm with an eerie, piercing eye in the centre. Levels 1 -5 At these levels, The Hand That Sees consists of: • Seven acolytes This group of wizards have only just started on the road to magical masterdom, and they are yet to decide how they will specialise their abilities. Motives. The acolytes are seeking out worthy opponents to test their newfound magical skills on. Flaws. The wizards have convinced themselves that they are already powerful magicians, and this arrogance could be their undoing. Tactics. The acolytes spread themselves out to avoid area attacks, but they focus their attention on one enemy at a time to completely annihilate their foes piece by piece. Levels 6 -1 0 At these levels, The Hand That Sees consists of: • Six acolytes • Four pseudodragons • One illusionist The first of the acolytes has found his true calling as an illusionst, and has become the de facto leader of the Hand. Other acolytes have tamed pseudodragons to act as familiars. The group gains: Extra Tactics. The illusionist uses his magic to conceal the group's movements, meaning they can make stealthy first strikes against their enemies. Four of the acolytes keep their pseudodragons close by to aid them in battle. Levels 1 1 -1 5 At these levels, The Hand That Sees consists of: • Four acolytes • One transmuter • One illusionist • One enchanter More of the acolytes are finding their true paths, specialising their magic to aid the Hand. The transmuter now leads the group. They also gain: Extra Tactics. Thanks to the enchanter, all the acolytes are now supplied with magical weapons and items. Levels 1 6 -2 0 At these levels, The Hand That Sees consists of: • Three acolytes • One transmuter • One illusionist • One enchanter • One conjurer • One dust, ice, magma, mud, smoke and steam mephit The true power in the Hand has shown himself: the mighty conjurer. Thanks to his abilities, the Hand is now surrounded by a variety of mephit familiars. They also gain: Extra Tactics. The acolytes use their mephit familiars as a vanguard force to protect themselves while they rain down spells from above. 15 Duels The players aren't the only powerful heroes and villains searching for adventure on the open road - plenty of men, women and other creatures stalk the wilderness with hungry eyes, searching for that next challenge, that next trial. If you should run into one of these fearsome folk, expect a duel to the death. These single-creature encounters are designed to challenge the players not just tactically, but morally and socially as well. As each of the duel creatures are a set CR, it is not as easy to adjust them for various player levels; instead, they are simply ordered from the weakest creature to the strongest, and a recommended player level is provided for each. Nevertheless, as with any of the random encounters here, feel free to use a duel creature which is far too powerful for the players to handle; the danger of annhiliation, and the thrill of a frantic retreat, can be just as exhilirating as a battle. Select the duel you want, or determine it randomly using the table below. 1 d2 0 Duel CR 1 Martial Arts Adept 3 2 Knight 3 3 Orc Blade of Ilneval 4 4 Kraken Priest 5 5 Half-Dragon Veteran 5 6 Hobgoblin Warlord 6 7 Warlock of the Fiend 7 8 Drow Priestess of Lolth 8 9 Blackguard 8 1 0 Assassin 8 1 1 Necromancer 9 1 2 Champion 9 1 3 Warlord 1 2 1 4 Vampire 1 3 1 5 Storm Giant 1 3 1 6 Fire Giant Dreadnought 1 4 1 7 Planetar 1 6 1 8 Iron Golem 1 6 1 9 Death Knight 1 7 2 0 Lich 2 1 1 . Martial Arts Adept Suitable for: 2nd level and above (3-4 party size) This martial arts adept is a human woman called Ellumia. Though not evil, she believes the balance of ki must be kept by the strong constantly weeding out the weak. As such, she will challenge any sentient creatures she comes across, using her Way of the Open Hand techniques to stun and immobilise foes. If she is brought near to death, she will concede defeat and ask to be spared so that she might return to her temple. 2 . Knight Suitable for: 2nd level and above (3-4 party size) This knight is a male dwarf who calls himself the Underhill King, believing himself to have been cheated out of his underground kingdom by scheming humans and elves. If he comes across anyone of these races he will challenge them to a fight to the death, though he will be more amenable around other dwarves. 3 . Orc Blade of Ilneval Suitable for: 3rd level and above (3-4 party size) This orc blade of Ilneval, known only as Duu'rah, stalks the wilds by himself in search of fresh foes to test his favour from Ilneval. Every victory brings a new trophy to add to his belt and further evidence, in his mind, that Ilneval will never allow him to fall in battle. 4 . Kraken Priest Suitable for: 4th level and above (3-4 party size) Unkharii, a kraken priest, was once a kind and dedicated assistant to a lakeside shrine. The male elf gradually fell under the telepathic influence of a subterranean kraken. Now Unkharii travels from water source to water source, falling further and further into madness as he attempts to corrupt all the waters in the world with the touch of the kraken. 5 . Half-Dragon Veteran Suitable for: 4th level and above (3-4 party size) This half-dragon veteran is of the black variety and is called Nuxeter. Due to his ancestry, Nuxeter is consumed by a hatred of seeing the weak prosper, so he stampedes across the land in a furious rampage, hacking down anything and anyone that gets in the way of his destructive tendencies. 6 . Hobgoblin Warlord Suitable for: 5th level and above (3-4 party size) Having lost his entire warband to a surprise attack by an ancient black dragon, this hobgoblin warlord (known only as Tarth) carries his shame and anger across the wilderness, hoping to redeem himself in the eyes of Maglubiyet by besting more and more powerful foes. 7 . Warlock of the Fiend Suitable for: 5th level and above (3-4 party size) This warlock, a human male called Brunmaer, made a pact with the Demon Lord Graz'zt to gain his fiendish magical abilities. The Dark Prince has augmented Brunmaer's already considerable vanity, and the warlock now believes himself to be the pre-eminent spellcaster of the age. To maintain his demonic powers, the warlock must constantly kill sentient creatures and offer up their souls to Graz'zt. 16 8 . Drow Priestess of Lolth Suitable for: 6th level and above (3-4 party size) This drow priestess of Lolth slinks by moonlight across the wilds of the surface, remembering neither her name nor her origin, consumed only by a desire to please the Spider Queen. The more hated surface-dwellers she can ensnare, the better. 9 . Blackguard Suitable for: 6th level and above (3-4 party size) Once a noble paladin, Tehran Balendar now roams the roads as a fearsome blackguard, having long since broken his holy pact. Alternating between arrogant fury and maddening guilt, he challenges all he comes across to prove his self-worth. 1 0 . Assassin Suitable for: 6th level and above (3-4 party size) Masterful in his preparation and execution of high-risk assassination contracts, the assassin Junkar Prestoras has made quite a name for himself despite his relatively young age. And he's not just in it for the money - he genuinely loves to kill, which is why adventurers who meet him on the road should beware. 1 1 . Necromancer Suitable for: 7th level and above (3-4 party size) This necromancer, a high elf named Ruz'atru, is never short of bodies to test his foul experiments on, because he leaves piles of them in his wake as he cuts across the land. Meeting this mad wizard forces travellers to fight, flee, or suffer undeath. 1 2 . Champion Suitable for: 7th level and above (3-4 party size) A fighter at the top of his game, this champion goes by the name of Avendul. Though not an evil man, he arrogantly believes everyone who lays eyes on his mighty frame should best him in single combat to prove they are worthy to look on him. 1 3 . Warlord Suitable for: 10th level and above (3-4 party size) The heady rhythm of the battle drum is where this warlord, known as Garrestern the Third, finds inner peace. He fights not for glory or wealth, merely for the pleasure of bloodlust. 1 4 . Vampire Suitable for: 11th level and above (3-4 party size) The vampire has forgotten its own name and lineage, and is driven on through the wilds only by its insatiable hunger for blood and its unspeakable desire to regain its memory. It slinks through the darkness, bent on consuming all it finds. 1 5 . Storm Giant Suitable for: 11th level and above (3-4 party size) Thunder clashes across the sky as this storm giant travels in search of omens from Annam that will signal the return of the great giant city of Ostoria. In its mad search, it is likely to mistakenly spot travellers as sacrifices that must be made to herald his kingdom's renewal. 1 6 . Fire Giant Dreadnought Suitable for: 12th level and above (3-4 party size) This fire giant dreadnought has fallen into disgrace, and now wanders the wilds in the hope of proving its strength to regain its position in the Ordning. It will ignore weaker creatures, although that's no guarantee of avoiding the rampaging crush of its gigantic shields. 1 7 . Planetar Suitable for: 13th level and above (3-4 party size) This planetar has been banished to the Material Plane for an unknown reason, and has lost its divine awareness ability. In a frenzy of anger and nihilism, it has taken to roaming the wilderness in search of evil foes to defeat in the hopes of redeeming itself. However, it no longer has the capacity to determine which creatures are evil, and which are not. 1 8 . Iron Golem Suitable for: 13th level and above (3-4 party size) The mad wizard that created this iron golem must have simply ordered it to go on a murderous rampage across the land, because that is all it knows how to do. Devoid of reason or intelligence, unlucky travellers that meet it can only hope to defeat it or outrun it. 1 9 . Death Knight Suitable for: 15th level and above (3-4 party size) Duke Harken began his descent from paladin to death knight when he chose to save himself and his wife from an onslaught of gnolls, leaving hundreds of his own townsfolk to die instead. He steadily fell into misfortune, and after his own gruesome death rose again as an undead killer. All he can do now is cut across the wilds, unleashing his infinite fury. 2 0 . Lich Suitable for: 20th level and above (3-4 party size) This lich calls itself the Pale King, and some distant memory of its former life has stirred it from its arcane lair to roam the wilds in a lurching, erratic route towards whatever dull thought it thinks it is following. Along the way it constantly kills any it finds to feed its phylactery with fresh souls. 17 Non-Combat T he road is full of travellers, and, contrary to popular belief, not all of them are itching to stick a knife in your belly to grab your coin purse. There are often days in the wilderness that pass with nothing worthy of comment - but perceptive folk know that there's always something going on, if one looks hard enough. Provided below are a series of chapters detailing random encounters that have a social or intellectual focus instead of being combat-orientated. Pick them at random to provide some small flavour to your travelling or sleeping sections, or consider using them as inspiration for a larger quest - even the smallest conversation can blossom into a riveting adventure hook. Travelling Scenes Often you require little more than a few words of description to give a better sense of the world as your players make their way through it. Some examples of such small scenes are provided below.

Provided below are some original small communities that your players might stumble across in their travels. Select the community appropriate to your setting, or determine it randomly on the table below. 1 d1 2 Community 1 Rednar's Fall 2 Trennewick 3 Unthertow 4 Silondol 5 Kertamen' 6 Razunrol 7 Varakens 8 Tintern's Place 9 Mhullendol 1 0 Forgotten Fingers 1 1 Jahn 1 2 The Dark 1 . Rednar's Fall The chief feature of this small human village of about two dozen residents is the large well in the centre for which it gains its name. Legend speaks of a demonic curse that befell the village, and, in a final attempt to save his people, the town's leader - the eponymous Rednar - begged Ilmater to save them, promising to fall down the well for eternity in return. As soon as he leapt in, the town found itself miraculously cured of its curse. Even now, nothing thrown into the well can ever be recovered, and it is customary for the residents to deposit food offerings into the well every evening to sustain Rednar, who they assume continues to fall to this day. Ideals. The residents of Rednar's Fall are a tight-knit community who value trust, honour, and the bond of family above all things. A promise from one of the Fall is never broken, and they shun those that fail to keep their word. Services. Though they have little to trade, one of the residents - Hujjamar - is a skilled blacksmith with the odd weapon or piece of armour to spare, and the town's two resident hunters (twins called Alenrar and Quell) will sell rations, arrows and bolts. 2 . Trennewick This swarthy human town, consisting of four large, square stone houses, is home to a dozen eerily quiet residents. Their outlook is entirely neutral, and they seem to care little about who comes and goes in their town. The reason, as persistent visitors may discover, is that the residents of Trennewick are devout worshippers of Eldath, the goddess of peace and quiet places. They simply want to be left to tend the subterranean waters that flow underneath the town's surface. Ideals. Trennewickians abhor violence of any kind, and luckily their heartfelt worship of Eldath has not been for nought: any attacks made in the boundaries of Trennewick instantly miss. Visitors that remain quiet and peaceful are accepted with a welcome that verges on kindliness. Services. The residents of Trennewick are always surprised when folk ask for trade or other services, as all of their own needs are supplied through their worship of Eldath. Nevertheless, they do have a tradeswoman, Lillian, who can sell rations and other such general goods. 3 . Unthertow The dozen or so human residents of this town are a bizarre bunch: though they don't live anywhere near a major water source, they openly operate a cult dedicated to the evil machinations of a kraken. Perhaps because they are so ridiculous in their woship - which consists primarily of eating a diet entirely of fish and making what they believe to be 'kraken cries' at all hours of the day - a kraken has not actually blessed them with any of its powers, as it might do for real kraken priests. Still, the residents are happy enough believing that one day they will be delivered from the drudgery of day-to-day life by the power of the kraken. Until then, they scorn outsiders, yet are still, for some reason, amenable to trading with them. Ideals. To an Unthertowian, everything pales in significance when compared with the almighty power of the kraken. Crude depictions of the fearsome beast adorn most doorways, and they take great offence if any travellers mock the various cheap shrines and poorly-made trinkets they have lying around. Services. Despite being outwardly rude and scornful of oustiders, the residents of Unthertow actually have quite a few general goods which they will grudgingly trade if asked. 4 . Silondol Silondol - \"the shining rock\" in the Elvish tongue - is a hamlet whose two dozen residents are exclusively high elves. They tend a rocky outcropping which rises out of the ground, about as large as a house, which, as its name suggests, gives off a faint blue light at all hours. The elves have constructed their simple dwellings around this site, which they revere as a symbol of the Seldarine. They are happy for visitors to inspect the rock as long as they are courteous and respectful. The rock flares with light if any magic is cast near it, though the elves, for all their wisdom, are still unsure what its use is. Ideals. Unlike most high elves, the residents of Silondol bear other races no ill will. They have all been drawn to this place by their shared love of the mysterious rock, and wish only for a quiet life of meditation and research to discover its arcane secrets. If anyone threatens their way of life, however, they are more than ready to defend it. Services. Visitors who especially impress the elves may be allowed to use their extensive enchanting skills to identify magical items, grant temporary enhancements, or to trade in rare items. 21 5 . Kertamen' Kertamen', or \"the place of runes\" in Elvish, is a village of about three dozen elves which pulses with magical energy. There are a whole mixture of elves here - high, wood, half, even a few moon varieties - all brought together by the shared heritage of the runes. Here the skills of rune-making are passed from master to apprentice, a carefully guarded secret which makes the residents understandably wary of passing visitors. Nevertheless, they are peaceful folk, and won't turn away the opportunity to trade. Ideals. The elves here believe their rune-scribing skills to be unique in the world, so they take special pride in their abilities and their shared commitment in maintaining it. They are naturally inclined to like those who specialise in arcane knowledge and can spot the runes for what they are worth. Services. The rune-scribing process is not easy, and the elves don't just hand it out to anyone. Even those that have managed to gain the elves' trust and respect must still pay heavy prices to gain the power of the runes. It can prove worth it, however: the runes can be used to bolster weapons and armour, provide protection from scrying and other magical effects, and even create deadly traps. 6 . Razunrol This labyrinthian mine is called Razunrol (\"silver stone\" in Dwarvish) after the shimmering veins of silver ore that snake through the rock here. An extended family of two dozen dwarves live and work here, styling themselves as the Raz clan in honour of the silver which has made them rich. The Raz have grown somewhat arrogant in their good fortune, but the younger dwarves know that the silver won't last forever, causing something of a family tension. Ideals. The Raz are a proud clan, and their smithing and mining skills are certainly worthy of being called masterful. However, many of the dwarves (particularly the older ones) will not take kindly to any criticism of their way of life, particularly with regard to the silver supply, which the treat with an almost religious significance, believing it will never run out. Services. The dwarves are wealthy residents and have plenty to trade, including fine weapons and armour. Many of them are master blacksmiths, and are willing and able to mend and improve anything metal - for a price, of course. 7 . Varakens \"The place of the mind\" is the meaning of this dwarven town's name, which automatically marks it out as something unusual: dwarves are known for many things, but thinking isn't one of them. Nonetheless, that is exactly what the dozen residents here spend their time doing. This hamlet consists of a few shared houses, a feasting hall, and an extensive library with tomes on all manner of dwarvish customs, history, and culture. Dwarves that show a greater aptitude for thinking and writing than swinging a pickaxe are sent to Varakens to work as custodians of various aspects of dwarven life. Though most dwarves scorn such work openly, in their hearts they know it to be a vital role in maintaining the shared knowledge of the dwarven clans. Ideals. Unusually, these dwarves respect the strength of the mind over the strength of the arm. Any who take an interest in their numerous scrolls and books on dwarven history are welcome to delve deeper. All the residents of Varakens are not just custodians but enthusiasts in the knowledge of dwarven culture. Services. Being especially knowledgeable about various aspects of history and culture, the Varakensians find their greatest export is information. They subsist on food donated by the local dwarf clans, so they have little else to trade. 8 . Tintern's Place This village is likely to be overlooked by the unobservant, given that its dozen houses are each little more than glorified dog kennels. Keen eyes will spot this for a halfling hamlet, however, and will know that such a place is likely to be rife with good ale, good food, and the best storytelling in the region. Those that investigative further will not be disappointed: the extended family that reside at Tintern's Place are jovial and warm, gladly accepting outsiders who are willing to share in their quaint and peaceful culture. Ideals. The halflings value family and community above all things, and a slight to one is a slight to them all. They revel in the telling and retelling of stories and legends, many of which have been passed down through so many generations that they contain, unbeknownst to the halflings, the last recorded location of mythical items or the sole method for killing a powerful lich. Wise travellers would do well to listen to such tall tales - they may prove more useful than they seem. Services. The halflings have a few spare general goods they are happy to trade with, but their main services lie in good company and excellent storytelling. 9 . Mhullendol Even this town's name hints at the clash of cultures it contains: \"mhullen\" is the Dwarvish word for \"brusies\", whilst \"-dol\" is the Elvish suffix which means \"place of\". The town, which consists of about two dozen houses, has an unusual population mix of half dwarves and half high elves. The two races clashed over territory here, but fell into a stalemate that lasted for so long the temporary buildings became permenant, and the two sides forgot what the point of their fight was. Now they live in relative harmony, though tavern disputes aren't exactly unheard of. Ideals. Both elves and dwarves know that further bloodshed would be fruitless here, so they are all equally committed to keeping the peace. However, both cultures are keen to avoid mixing too much, and all the residents would take offence at any insinuation that they have become 'the same'. Services. Mhullendol brings together the smithing skills of the dwarves and the magical knowledge of the elves into one handy destination, which is a key reason it has continued to prosper. A wide variety of goods and services are thus available to friendly (and wealthy) visitors. 22 1 0 . Forgotten Fingers This village is characterised by the five curved stone pillars that rise out of the ground around it, much like the fingers of an upturned hand. The half-dozen houses sit on the palm of this 'hand', their low thatched roofs protected from the elements by the grasping rock of the Fingers. A medley of human, elf, and dwarf outcasts have made a home here, drawn together simply by the fact that they don't belong anywhere else. Wary of outsiders, they trade when they have to and only ask that visitors don't ask too many questions. Most of the residents have pasts they'd rather leave hidden. Ideals. The people of the Forgotten Fingers are naturally solitary folk who have come together for convinience and mutual protection rather than any sense of communitiy. As such they are generally introverted characters who communicate in brief, spartan exchanges, if at all. They only ask to live the rest of their lives without having to be reminded of their murky pasts. Services. Residents of the Forgotten Fingers trade grudgingly, as with everything they do. The humans deal with the general goods while the dwarves can offer some smithing skills, and the elves might have the odd magical item lying around. 1 1 . Jahn This prosperous trading town is well-known locally for its friendly multi-cultural atmosphere. Humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, even half-orcs, tieflings and dragonborn - you name it, Jahn has it. Most of the fifty or so residents here are wanderers and adventurers who have found a suitably exciting place to settle down in; as such, the nights are brimming with tales of adventure and the boasting of mighty victories in the town's main tavern, the Eagle and Crown. Fresh-faced explorers looking for guides, tutors or even companions would all they desired in Jahn. Ideals. Though the people of Jahn have no shared culture or sense of communitiy, the individuals that comprise the town all know from their adventures that it pays to be friendly. Unnecessary aggression is disapproved of and, considering most residents have made a living from monster hunting or dungeon delving, such outbreaks are swiftly dealt with. Services. The melting pot of skills in Jahn mean a great range of goods pass through the town's marketplace every day. More profitable, though, is the passing on of more valuable wares, like exploration experience and fighting prowess. Most Jahnians take up tutoring at one point or another, and would-be adventurers come from far and wide to benefit from the wisdom of the town's retired heroes. 1 2 . The Dark Most wanderers decide to turn back when the area around them suddenly turns pitch black and icy cold. Those that venture on might stumble across The Dark, and immediately wish they hadn't. The residents of this small village are all drow of the Wethrina clan, well-known in the Underdark for their skills at stealth and scheming. However, after a rival clan all but obliterated the Wethrinas, those that survived were forced to flee to the surface and coat their home in a blanket of magical darkness to block out the harmful rays of the sun. Though obviously mistrustful of any who manage to come across their hidden home, the Wethrina are in a more dire state than they would like to admit, and would not turn away decent trade. Ideals. Though inherently evil, the Wethrina have slowly grown more accustomed to living on the surface, and are slightly more amenable to the idea of other races compared to their Underdark brethren. They will suffer no slight to their great goddess Lolth, but if visitors are respectful and suitably terrified, the drow will at least allow them to live. Services. The drow hold magical secrets that even the high elves cannot access. Wanderers who prove themselves as firm friends of the Wethrina might gain the opportunity to benefit from their drow knowledge. 23 Minor Events Traps, skirmish scenes, adventurers in need - there's always something exciting happened out in the wilds, even if it's little more than a speck on the map of your world-spanning adventure. Nevertheless, sometimes its the smallest things that have the greatest impact. Below are some small events that might befall your players as they wander through the world. As usual, they are split by locale. Choose the minor event you want or determine it randomly using the tables provided. Tundra 1 d8 Minor Event 1 Crevasse 2 Magical Box 3 Falling Ice 4 Injured Climber 5 Frozen Adventurer* 6 Auril's Shrine* 7 Emerald Enclave 8 Lord's Alliance *Indicates that the event is one-use only. 1 . Trap: Crevasse A thin crevasse in the ice could be hazardous to to unwary travellers. The player at the front of the marching order must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check or have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher to spot the crevasse. If they do not spot it, the player at the front of the marching order falls into the crevasse, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage and trapping their leg, thereby coming under the restrained condition. A trapped player must succeed on a DC 16 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (player's choice) to escape, gaining one level of exhaustion each time they fail. They gain advantage on this check if another creature attempts to help pull them out. 2 . Magical Box In an old campsite, someone has left behind a mysterious- looking box. The box is unlocked and doesn't appear to be magical. If a player opens the box, roll 1d4, then apply the appropriate effect below: 1 d4    Effect 1 All the player's equipment and clothing disappears, returning 6 hours later 2 All of the player's modifiers swap from positive to negative, and vice versa, for 6 hours 3 The player and the closest creature to it swap equipment for 6 hours 4 All of the player's attacks deal an extra 1 d4 psychic damage for 6 hours 3 . Trap: Falling Ice Whilst passing by a tall ice wall, some of the icicles come loose and fall on the unsuspecting players. All creatures in a 15 ft. square under where the icicles fall must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d4 piercing damage on a failed save. 4 . Injured Climber You can hear quick, low breathing and gasps of pain coming from the rocky valley to the west. You come upon a half-dead human man in the trappings of an arctic explorer, all ropes, pulleys, picks and pitons. He appears to have taken a fatal fall – his left leg is protruding at a strange angle, and blood is gushing from an open wound in his side. If the party leaves the climber to die, or if they kill him, he comes back as a ghost to haunt the players 24 hours later, and the party loses -1 Renown with the Harpers. The climber must be healed by 10 Hit Points to become stable. Players who attempt to give the climber a health potion must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to apply it, losing the potion and having no effect on a failed save. If players attempt to save the climber but aren't successful, the don't lose any Renown with the Harpers. If they are successful in saving him, read: The climber’s breathing steadily slows and the gash in his side begins to heal. His eyes flutter open and he grunts in pain as he gazes up at you. “ Damn it all,” he says. “ I knew I should’ve put a double knot on it.” He eyes you warily. “ Thanks for the help, strangers. These tundra regions ain’t safe, you know – here, let me give you something to help out.” The party comes under the effect of the jump and longstrider spells for 3 hours. They also gain +1 Renown with the Harpers. 5 . Frozen Adventurer As you pass along a high ridge of ice, you notice a darkened shape behind the glaze. Drawing closer, you see with a start that it's the preserved body of some unfortunate human adventurer, his face still contorted in surprise and pain. The most bizarre thing is how lifelike the frozen body appears to be. Players can thaw the adventurer by dealing at least 30 fire damage to the ice around him, or by holding a torch there for half an hour. 24 As the last of the ice thaws from the adventurer's body, you see a pink hue slowly begin to return to his body. However, he is still not breathing. The adventurer must be healed by 10 Hit Points to become stable. Players who attempt to give the adventurer a health potion must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to apply it, losing the potion and having no effect on a failed save. If they are successful in stabilising him, read: The man's eyes flutter and he wakes with an explosive coughing fit. Once he has vomited all the water from his lungs, he is finally able to look around at you, his saviours. \"By my life,\" he croaks, \"art thou real? Or art thou a construction of the mind, so snowy-capped as mine hath become? Say, if thou canst, the type of man, plant, or otherwordly thing thou art!\" This idiosyncratic fellow is Wilhelm Shudderspike, a bard of ancient times who was imprisoned in ice by the goddess Auril for writing a play about her. Auril was so impressed by the play that she decided she didn't want any other deity to have such a boon, so she sealed the writer away. Shudderspike can be convinced to join the party on their quest for a short while so he can learn more about the world he finds himself in. He uses the bard stat block. 6 . Auril's Shrine As you wander, a more distinct white shape begins to form in the distance against the smooth curtain of snow. Drawing nearer, you see that someone has constructed a rectangular altar of pure ice, into which a variety of complex scenes have been etched. As you gaze upon the strange shrine a voice emerges from behind it. \"Riddle me this, traveller,\" the heavy male voice says, \"which mighty goddess is the first of all unknowable rulers in lore?\" Stepping out from behind the shrine, you see the voice belongs to a humanoid figure in shimmering white armour who hefts a resplendent greatsword. No, not armour - those are the glittering scales of a half-dragon that shine in the icy light. He stands between you and the shrine, awaiting your answer. This white half-dragon veteran will attack if the players attempt to come near the shrine without answering his riddle. If the players take too long figuring out the riddle, add: \"Pfft,\" the half-dragon scoffs, \"be gone from my sight, then.\" If they continue to remain without solving the riddle, the half- dragon will attack them. Players can make Intelligence (History) or Intelligence (Religion) checks to recall the names of common gods that might be relevant, such as Lathander, Oghma, Selune, Sune, Torm, Auril, Helm, and Tymora. Players might employ some lateral thinking to realise that the trick is in the sneaky half- dragon's wording: the goddess's name is \"the first of all uknowable rules in lore\", or Auril, the goddess of ice and winter. If they provide the answer, read: The half-dragon tilts his head in a slight nod. \"Very well,\" he says, \"you may approach the Frostmaiden's shrine. Offer your faith to the Icedawn.\" Players that pray at the shrine or give an offering gain resistance to cold damage for 3 hours. 7 . Faction: Emerald Enclave Choose the faction event relevant for the players' relationship with the faction. If some players have positive relationships with the faction and some negative, use the Neutral Event. Neutral Event. If none of the players have positive or negative renown with the faction, or if players in the same party have both positive and negative renown, read the following: As you tack across the ice and snow, you spot a solitary figure in a simple white cloak standing at the edge of a rocky outcropping, watching the passage of the sun across the sky. \"A fine day,\" he remarks quietly as you pass, \"mind you keep it that way.\" You notice that the man has a weathered clasp on his cloak in the shape of a leaf, with well-made leather armour underneath it. This Emerald Enclave ranger uses the archer stat block. If players attack him, they lose -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. Revenge Event. If any of the players have negative renown with the faction, read: You've been travelling over the tundra for a while now. As you pass by some outcropping rocks, however, you notice that one of the stones is not a rock at all, but an elf in a camouflaged white cloak. He draws a bow from the folds of his robe. \"Now you will pay for your crimes against nature,\" he intones, nocking an arrow. There are three archers, including this one, hidden in the snowy surroundings here. If the players repent and ask for forgiveness, the archers leave them alone and the players gain +1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. Otherwise, the archers fight until they kill the players or are killed themselves. 25 Saviour Event. If any of the players have +1 or +2 Renown with the faction, read: A sudden crash to the east is followed by shouts of anger and the clamour of metal on metal. Following the sound, you come across a man in a white cloak crossing swords with a group of very burly, very angry dwarves in winter armour. The one archer here is an Emerald Enclave agent fighting against five dwarves (the dwarves use the thug stat block). The players can help either side, which turns the opposing side hostile to them. If the players remain neutral, whichever side wins will flee, and the players lose -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. If the players side with the dwarfs and they win, read: One of the dwarves leans on his hammer to look at you. “ Mighty fine help in a fight, aren’t you?” he says, and you aren’t sure if he’s being sarcastic or not. “ At any rate, best to keep your mouth shut about this, eh? Here ya go – this is what you’re looking for, aye?” The dwarf gives the party a pouch containing 2d10 gp. The players lose -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. If the players side with the archer and they win, read: The robed man catches his breath and gives you a curt nod. “ Thanks for the assist,” he says. “ You’ve some sharpened skills there. Worry not – the Enclave will be in touch.” The players gain +1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. Mission Event. If any of the players have +3 Renown or more with the faction, read: A brown owl soars overhead, then begins to circle closer and closer towards you. Eventually it drops a piece of parchment at your feet and flies away. Unrolling the paper, you discover the following note: “ If you are in the area, make your way immediately to [ Location] . The Enclave must [ Mission] . Preserve the order.” Choose the appropriate location and mission, or determine it randomly, using the table below. Emerald Enclave Missions Emerald Enclave Missions 1 d8 Location Mission Renown 1 Neverwinter Wood Stop a bandit group from cutting down trees in the area. +1 2 Neverwinter Convince the Lord's Alliance to reduce urban expansion. +1 3 Sword Mountains Defend a mountain village from an orc attack. +2 4 Mere of Dead Men Deal with a green hag that is terrorising nearby communities. +1 /+2 * 5 Kryptgarden Forest Deal with a banshee that is haunting nearby villages. +1 /+2 * 6 Dessarin Bridge Deal with a troll that has taken up residence under the bridge. +1 /+2 * 7 Ardeep Forest Defend a forest village from a gnoll attack. +2 8 Waterdeep Convince the Lord's Alliance to bolster patrols on the frontier. +3 *Players gain more renown if they complete this mission without killing the creature in question. If players fail to complete a mission, they lose -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. If they succeed, wait a few days before reading: You are surprised to see a stag laden with saddlebags canter up to you. It watches you without fear, and you could almost swear it knew what you wear thinking. Reaching into one of the saddlebags, you find a leather bag with your name on it, which thanks you for your recent deeds. Mission Rewards 1 d8 Reward 1 -4 2 d2 0 gp 5 -6 Cloak of elvenkind 7 Bracers of archery 8 Quiver of Ehlonna 8 . Faction: Lord's Alliance Choose the faction event relevant for the players' relationship with the faction. If some players have positive relationships with the faction and some negative, use the Neutral Event. Neutral Event. If none of the players have positive or negative renown with the faction, or if players in the same party have both positive and negative renown, read the following: As you continue on your journey, you notice a heavily armoured knight closely studying a map. He appears to be deep in thought about something, but as you approach he looks up and gives you a cheerful smile. “ Staying safe, I hope?” he says. 26 This Lord's Alliance knight will happily engage in conversation with the players. If players attack him, they lose -1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance. Revenge Event. If any of the players have negative renown with the faction, read: You spot three figures in the distance. Drawing closer, you come to see that they are heavily armoured knights, their breastplates each embalzoned with a golden crown on a red background. One of them raises his longsword and points it towards you. \"By the power invested in me,\" he intones, \"for your crimes, you are sentenced to death - effective immediately!\" These are three knights. If the players repent and ask for forgiveness, the knights leave them alone and the players gain +1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance. Otherwise, the knights fight until they kill the players or are killed themselves. Saviour Event. If any of the players have +1 or +2 Renown with the faction, read: From the northwest, a sudden medley of voices cry out and the sound of clashing metal quickly follows. Following the clamour, you soon discover a well-armoured knight attempting to cut down a large group of lightly armoured men. It is impossible to tell who started this fight, or who has the upper hand. The one knight here is a Lord's Alliance adventurer fighting against seven thugs. The players can help either side, which turns the opposing side hostile to them. If the players remain neutral, whichever side wins will flee, and the players lose -1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance. If the players side with the thugs and they win, read: One of the men wipes the blood from his forehead as he approaches you. “ Many thanks, strangers,” he gasps. “ That Lord’s Alliance knight have been hunting us for weeks. We thought our cult would be safe out here in the tundra...but I guess we underestimated how far the Alliance's influence reaches.

Trap: Landslide The rocky crags on coastal shelfs can be loosened by the eroding waves. The player in the middle of the marching order must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check or have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher to spot the loose rocks. If they do not spot it, a sudden gust of wind causes the rocks to crumble loose and tumble into a landslide. All creatures in a 30 ft. line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. 2 . Trap: Trap Hole Some nefarious group has disguised a hole in the ground with a fake covering of sand and small pebbles. The player at the front of the marching order must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check or have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher to spot the trap hole. If they do not spot it, the player at the front of the marching order falls into the hole and must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. A trapped player must succeed on a DC 16 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (player's choice) to escape, gaining one level of exhaustion each time they fail. They gain advantage on this check if another creature attempts to help pull them out, and they instantly succeed if they use climbing equipment like pitons or ropes. Optional Rule.

Creatures restrained in this way must succeed on a DC 16 Stength (Athletics) or a DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to escape, gaining one level of exhaustion each time they fail. They gain advantage on this check if another creature attempts to help pull them out. After 5 turns, any creatures still restrained by the quicksand become submerged in it and suffocate. 4 . Injured Climber You can hear quick, low breathing and gasps of pain coming from the crags ahead of you. Following the sound, you come upon a half-dead human man in the trappings of a climber, all ropes, pulleys, picks and pitons. He appears to have taken a fatal fall – his left leg is protruding at a strange angle, and blood is gushing from an open wound in his side. If the party leaves the climber to die, or if they kill him, he comes back as a ghost to haunt the players 24 hours later, and the party loses -1 Renown with the Harpers. The climber must be healed by 10 Hit Points to become stable.

These coastal cliffs are more dangerous than they look – here, let me give you something to help out.” The party comes under the effect of the jump and longstrider spells for 3 hours. They also gain +1 Renown with the Harpers. 5 . Strange Nest As you make your way further along the coastline, you come across a huge collection of branches and logs that have been arranged among a rocky outcropping.

Bottled Message The lull of the tide provides a calm backdrop as you wander onwards. As you walk, a glint from the sea catches your eye. Focusing your attention, you see that a clear wine bottle is bobbing over the waves towards the shore. Even from this distance you can see that there is a piece of parchment rolled inside the bottle. If a player opens the bottle, roll 1d4 and consult the table below to see what is inside. Bottle Contents 1 d4 Contents 1 A note in Abyssal, written in blood, which curses the reader with a -1 0 reduction to their maximum Hit Points.

On the altar, someone has etched and painted a symbol of two hands crossed and bound with a red cord. Players who succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence (Religion) check can determine that this is a shrine to Ilmater, the god of suffering, endurance, and the oppressed. 32 Any player who interacts with the shrine is hit with a sudden wave of mental pain, taking 1d12 psychic damage and hearing the words, \"Do you endure?\" If the player responds affirmatively, or if they remain near the shrine without responding, they take another 1d12 damage and the words are repeated. The damage ends if the player responds negatively or if they move away from the shrine. If the psychic damage brings the player to 0 Hit Points, they hear the words, \"You are one who endures much...revel in bearing the weight of others' suffering, and thou shalt be blessed.\" They are then fully restored of their Hit Points, spell slots and features, as though they had finished a long rest. Furthermore, the next time the player drops to 0 Hit Points, their Hit Points and spell slots are instantly fully restored by the blessing of Ilmater. 6 . Mirage The heat is beating down on you as you continue to travel across the dunes. Just as the thought of a cool, refreshing bath enters your head, you spot a glimmer in the distance. Drawing closer, you see that the sun is indeed reflecting off the calm waters of a desert oasis. Players who succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check can tell that this oasis is a mirage.

Trap: Awakened Tree An ancient oak tree can turn violent if disturbed from its slumber. The next time the players take a short or long rest, the tree will attempt to grapple them. Any player who is awake that succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check, or has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 17 or higher, spots the movement of the tree and can avoid being grappled. Any players who do not spot the tree become grappled by it, taking 1d4+2 bludgeoning damage each turn they remain grappled. Players use their action to make a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check to escape the grapple, gaining one level of exhaustion on a failed save. Dealing any fire damage to the tree causes it to release all grappled creatures. 2 . Trap: Trap Hole Some nefarious group has disguised a hole in the ground with a fake covering of leaves and twigs. The player at the front of the marching order must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check or have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher to spot the trap hole. If they do not spot it, the player at the front of the marching order falls into the hole and must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. A trapped player must succeed on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (player's choice) to escape, gaining one level of exhaustion each time they fail. They gain advantage on this check if another creature attempts to help pull them out, and they instantly succeed if they use climbing equipment like pitons or ropes. 3 . Magical Box In an old campsite, someone has left behind a mysterious- looking box. The box is unlocked and doesn't appear to be magical. If a player opens the box, roll 1d4, then apply the appropriate effect below: 1 d4    Effect 1 All the player's equipment and clothing disappears, returning 6 hours later 2 All of the player's modifiers swap from positive to negative, and vice versa, for 6 hours 3 The player and the closest creature to it swap equipment for 6 hours 4 All of the player's attacks deal an extra 1 d4 psychic damage for 6 hours 4 . Injured Adventurer You can hear quick, low breathing and gasps of pain coming from a thick section of trees ahead of you. Following the sound, you find a dishevelled, blood-soaked knight propped against a tree, his face hidden by a blackened visor. Though his armour is dirty now, it was clearly once a brilliant silver with scarlet lining. His weapon, a fine longsword which shimmers with an unnatural light, also looks expensive and well-made. At some point, he must have been a rich and successful adventurer – now, though, he is clearly in dire need, and looks close to death. His horse, if he had one, has run off, and it seems any allies he once had have disappeared as well. He coughs as he beckons to you. “ Please, sirrah,” he says. “ Can you spare me a few potions?” If the party leaves the adventurer to die, or if they kill him, he comes back as a revenant to take revenge the players 24 hours later, and the party loses -1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance. If they kill him, the players can also take the knight's plate armour and shimmering longsword (attacks with this weaopn ignore cold resistances). The adventurer must be healed by 10 Hit Points to become stable. Players who attempt to give the adventurer a health potion must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to apply it, losing the potion and having no effect on a failed save. If players attempt to save the adventurer but aren't successful, the don't lose any Renown with the Lord's Alliance. If they are successful in saving him, read: The knight's breathing becomes more regular, and a little colour returns to his cheeks. He rises shakily, using his sword to steady himself. “ You’ve shown me a great kindness,” he says. “ Here – let me show you an old trick I used to know.” The party comes under the effect of the crusader's mantle spell for 3 hours. They also gain +1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance. 36 5 . Druid Ritual The air seems to suddenly grow thicker and take on a yellow, sulphuric light. To your right, you think you can hear the soft melody of a woman singing. You cannot make out the words, but nonetheless, the music seems to lift your heart up and fill you with a quiet joy. Following the sound brings you to a small clearing, where five beautiful human women are standing in a circle around a tiny tree, their arms outstretched. The tree is pulsating with a strange green light and, even as you watch, it sprouts and grows at an alarming rate. The pace of the music is ever quickening, and the women keep their eyes firmly rooted on the magical tree. If the players interfere with the ritual, read: The five women let out a painful cry and disappear in a flash of yellow light. The tree creaks to a halt, then begins to turn black, its leaves shedding to the ground like flakes of skin. The whole clearing, from the grass to the outer trees, also begins to wilt and decay at an astonishing rate. Soon the entire area has been reduced to a graveyard of vegetation. The players lose -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. If the players wait for the ritual to be completed, read: It does not take long for the central tree to grow so large that it towers above the rest of the forest. Its bark seems to sign as it twists into a final position, and the entire clearing seems somehow happier for its presence. The five women drop their hands, then turn directly towards you and smile. Then they are gone in a flash of yellow light that sweeps past you like a sudden wind – though you cannot explain why, you feel faster, tougher, and more at one with the forest around you. The players come under the effect of the barkskin and longstrider spells for 3 hours, and gain +1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. 6 . Elf Imprisonment You hear the crack of a tree branch somewhere to your left, but you cannot turn in time – for a moment you feel a blunt pain on the back of your head, and then your vision cuts to black. You wake in a small, sparsely furnished cell. There is only one barred window, barely half a metre in size, through which you can see the dense foliage of the forest. A single wooden door with a sliding peephole is the only way out. Through the peephole you can see a corridor which stretches left and right. Directly in front of you stands a male elf, finely dressed in golden armour with emerald lacing. His green eyes stare into you, unmoving. “ Here you must remain, until wisdom and time have tempered your brain,” he says. Further inspection of the room reveals that twelve of the stone flagons on the floor bear an etched symbol, and that these flagons can be shifted into different positions on the floor (initial configuration shown below). Players must rearrange the flagons so that the Owl, Hourglass, Anvil, and Skull symbols align in the centre. Doing so opens the door leading back into the forest. If they succeed, the players come under the effect of the guidance and longstrider spells for 3 hours, and they gain +1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave.          Lightning Hourglass Spider Anvil          Cat Sun Pentagram Moon          Empty Owl Skull Sword Players can also force their way out by destroying or lockpicking the door (DC 14). If this occurs, the guard disappears and the players lose -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. 7 .

This Emerald Enclave ranger uses the archer stat block. If players attack him, they lose -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. Revenge Event. If any of the players have negative renown with the faction, read: You've been travelling through the woods for a while now. You hear a rustle to your left, and an elf in a camouflaged green and brown cloak materialises out of the shadows. He draws a bow from the folds of his robe. \"Now you will pay for your crimes against nature,\" he intones, nocking an arrow. There are three archers, including this one, hidden in the trees surroundings here. If the players repent and ask for forgiveness, the archers leave them alone and the players gain +1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. Otherwise, the archers fight until they kill the players or are killed themselves. Saviour Event. If any of the players have +1 or +2 Renown with the faction, read: 37 A sudden crash to the east is followed by shouts of anger and the clamour of metal on metal. Following the sound, you come across a man in a green cloak crossing swords with a group of very burly, very angry dwarves in heavy armour. The one archer here is an Emerald Enclave agent fighting against five dwarves (the dwarves use the thug stat block). The players can help either side, which turns the opposing side hostile to them. If the players remain neutral, whichever side wins will flee, and the players lose -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. If the players side with the dwarfs and they win, read: One of the dwarves leans on his hammer to look at you. “ Mighty fine help in a fight, aren’t you?” he says, and you aren’t sure if he’s being sarcastic or not. “ At any rate, best to keep your mouth shut about this, eh?

If the players side with the archer and they win, read: The robed man catches his breath and gives you a curt nod. “ Thanks for the assist,” he says. “ You’ve some sharpened skills there.

If the players side with the knight and they win, read: The knight gives a hearty laugh and sheaths his huge sword. He drops to one knee and mutters to himself for a few moments, clearly deep in prayer.

But darkness is everywhere, and we must remain vigilant – stay wary! I will spread your names to my brothers and sisters.

The player at the front of the marching order must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check or have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher to spot the crevasse. If they do not spot it, the player at the front of the marching order falls into the crevasse, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage and trapping their leg, thereby coming under the restrained condition. A trapped player must succeed on a DC 16 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (player's choice) to escape, gaining one level of exhaustion each time they fail. They gain advantage on this check if another creature attempts to help pull them out. 2 . Trap: Bear Trap Careless hunters have left a bear trap out in the open plains.

If Side A is a faction and the players give them a proper burial, they gain +1 Renown with that faction; otherwise, they lose -1 Renown with that faction. 5 . Revellers For a moment you think you must be dreaming, but no – that really is the sound of cheering and out-of-tune singing you can hear coming from the valley to the west. Coming around the bend, you find the noises belong to a group of jolly revellers, who have already managed to get through seven kegs of ale and are happily uncorking a further eight. One of them notices you and beckons you over with wild hand gestures. The five men all greet you joyfully, passing out spare mugs of beer. “ You’re just in time for the drinking competition!” one of them shouts. “ Get involved, won’t ya?” The revellers will insist that either all or none of the party gets involved. If the party refuses, the revellers send them on their way. If the party agrees, they must attempt to drink the strong ale of the revellers. On each drink, each player must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, with the DC rising by 2 for each subsequent drink. After each check, one of the revellers will pass out. If any one of the players succeeds on all five saving throws, read: The final reveller sways dangerously. “ Yav gawt some reeeaaaal drinkin’ talent,” he slurs. “ Ya geet the graaaaand priiiiiiize!” 40 The winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, a yellow cardboard crown which provides advantage to Charisma (Persuasion) checks. If a player fails any of the checks, they fall unconscious. If one of the players wins, the rest of the party wakes up. However, if the entire party falls unconscious, they wake up the next morning in the nearest settlement. You wake to the stench of stale alcohol and other unmentionable liquids. You are slumped on the porch of a tavern, the name of which you do not recognise. However, the proprietor, a stout male dwarf, clearly recognises you, as he is attempting to brush you into the street with a broom. “ That’s quite enough o’ that, lads,” he says. “ Be on your way with you.” Each player wakes with 5 Hit Points and has lost half their coin along with a random piece of equipment or treasure they were carrying. However, they gain one reveller's badge, a small wooden badge that can be traded at any tavern or inn for a flagon of ale. 6 . Abandoned Cart Far down the path you notice what seems to be a travelling wagon lying on its side. Upon closer inspection you find the cart is indeed a merchant’s wagon, though any wares it once stocked have long since been ransacked. The horse that had pulled it is lying dead, but its corpse seems relatively fresh; however, there is no obvious sign of the merchants themselves, or what might have happened to them. A successful DC 16 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals a set of tracks leading into a nearby cluster of trees. Under the shade of the trees you find two elven women lying amongst the leaves, apparently having crawled there. One is already dead, and the other is close to death – her breath comes in shallow rasps, and her eyes are closed. The elf must be healed by 10 Hit Points to stabilise her. Players who attempt to give the elf a health potion must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to apply it, losing the potion and having no effect on a failed save. If the party succeeds in saving the elf, read: The elf’s eyes burst open and she gives a small, girlish laugh. Grabbing her companion, she suddenly dissolves into lotus flowers along with her partner, becoming caught by the wind and floating away. For some reason you feel purified by the passing of the petals. The party comes under the effect of the aura of purity spell for 3 hours, and they gain +1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. If the party leaves the elf to die, or if they kill her, she comes back as a ghost to take revenge on the party 24 hours later, and the party loses -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. 7 .

When the earthquake hits, all creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, which is made with advantage by any creatures who expected the earthquake. Creatures caught in the earthquake take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and fall prone on a failed save, or half as much damage and no extra effects on a success. 2 . Trap: Rock Slide Loose rocks are a constant concern for any mountaineer. The player at the front of the marching order must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher to spot the potential rock slide. If players do not spot the rock slide, it falls upon the entire party, and all creatures caught in it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. 3 . Ancient Shrine Nestled underneath an overhanging crag lies an ancient shrine to a god long forgotten. If a player approaches the shrine, roll 1d4, then apply the appropriate effect below: 1 d4    Effect 1 The player becomes cursed by the god, suffering a -2 penalty to an ability score modifier of the DM's choice for 2 4 hours 2 The shrine consumes a random item in the player's possession 3 The shrine duplicates a random item in the player's possession 4 The player becomes blessed by the god, gaining a +2 bonus to an ability score modifier of the DM's choice for 2 4 hours 4 .

Perhaps two dozen [ Side As] lie in various states of bloodiness among the boulders, with as many [ Side Bs] interspersed between them. It is impossible to tell who won this fight, or what the [ Side As] were doing this far from civilisation. If Side A is a faction and the players give them a proper burial, they gain +1 Renown with that faction; otherwise, they lose -1 Renown with that faction. 5 . Revellers For a moment you think you must be dreaming, but no – that really is the sound of cheering and out-of-tune singing you can hear coming from the valley to the west. Coming around the bend, you find the noises belong to a group of jolly revellers, who have already managed to get through seven kegs of ale and are happily uncorking a further eight. One of them notices you and beckons you over with wild hand gestures. The five men all greet you joyfully, passing out spare mugs of beer. “ You’re just in time for the drinking competition!” one of them shouts. “ Get involved, won’t ya?” The revellers will insist that either all or none of the party gets involved. If the party refuses, the revellers send them on their way. If the party agrees, they must attempt to drink the strong ale of the revellers. On each drink, each player must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, with the DC rising by 2 for each subsequent drink. After each check, one of the revellers will pass out. If any one of the players succeeds on all five saving throws, read: The final reveller sways dangerously. “ Yav gawt some reeeaaaal drinkin’ talent,” he slurs. “ Ya geet the graaaaand priiiiiiize!” The winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, a The winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, aThe winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, a The winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, aThe winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, a The winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, aThe winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, a The winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, aThe winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, a The winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, aThe winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, a The winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, a yellow cardboard crown which provides advantage to yellow cardboard crown which provides advantage toyellow cardboard crown which provides advantage to yellow cardboard crown which provides advantage toyellow cardboard crown which provides advantage to yellow cardboard crown which provides advantage toyellow cardboard crown which provides advantage to yellow cardboard crown which provides advantage toyellow cardboard crown which provides advantage to yellow cardboard crown which provides advantage toyellow cardboard crown which provides advantage to yellow cardboard crown which provides advantage to Charisma (Persuasion) checks.Charisma (Persuasion) checks.

If one of the players wins, the rest of the party wakes up. However, if the entire party falls unconscious, they wake up the next morning in the nearest settlement. You wake to the stench of stale alcohol and other unmentionable liquids. You are slumped on the porch of a tavern, the name of which you do not recognise. However, the proprietor, a stout male dwarf, clearly recognises you, as he is attempting to brush you into the street with a broom. “ That’s quite enough o’ that, lads,” he says. “ Be on your way with you.” Each player wakes with 5 Hit Points and has lost half their coin along with a random piece of equipment or treasure they were carrying. However, they gain one reveller's badge, a small wooden badge that can be traded at any tavern or inn for a flagon of ale. 6 . Injured Climber You can hear quick, low breathing and gasps of pain coming from the crags ahead of you. Following the sound, you come upon a half-dead human man in the trappings of a climber, all ropes, pulleys, picks and pitons. He appears to have taken a fatal fall – his left leg is protruding at a strange angle, and blood is gushing from an open wound in his side. If the party leaves the climber to die, or if they kill him, he comes back as a ghost to haunt the players 24 hours later, and the party loses -1 Renown with the Harpers. The climber must be healed by 10 Hit Points to become stable. Players who attempt to give the climber a health potion must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to apply it, losing the potion and having no effect on a failed save. If players attempt to save the climber but aren't successful, the don't lose any Renown with the Harpers. If they are successful in saving him, read: The climber’s breathing steadily slows and the gash in his side begins to heal. His eyes flutter open and he grunts in pain as he gazes up at you. “ Damn it all,” he says. “ I knew I should’ve put a double knot on it.” He eyes you warily. “ Thanks for the help, strangers. These mountainsides are more dangerous than they look – here, let me give you something to help out.” The party comes under the effect of the jump and longstrider spells for 3 hours. They also gain +1 Renown with the Harpers. 7 . Faction: Zhentarim Choose the faction event relevant for the players' relationship with the faction.

Trap: Quagmire Areas of thick, gelatinous mud are a common cause for concern for any desert traveller. Any player that succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check or has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher spots the quagmire. If they do not spot it, all players that walk into the 15 ft. cube of the quagmire become restrained by it. Creatures restrained in this way must succeed on a DC 16 Stength (Athletics) or a DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to escape, gaining one level of exhaustion each time they fail. They gain advantage on this check if another creature attempts to help pull them out. After 5 turns, any creatures still restrained by the quagmire become submerged in it and suffocate. 2 . Trap: Awakened Moss A large patch of sentient moss can turn violent if disturbed from its slumber. The next time the players take a short or long rest, the moss will attempt to grapple them. Any player who is awake that succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check, or has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 17 or higher, spots the movement of the moss and can avoid being grappled. Any players who do not spot the tree become grappled by it, taking 1d4+2 poison damage each turn they remain grappled. Players use their action to make a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check to escape the grapple, gaining one level of exhaustion on a failed save. Dealing any fire damage to the moss causes it to release all grappled creatures. 3 . Ancient Shrine Standing on a small knoll is an ancient shrine to a god long forgotten. If a player approaches the shrine, roll 1d4, then apply the appropriate effect below: 1 d4    Effect 1 The player becomes cursed by the god, suffering a -2 penalty to an ability score modifier of the DM's choice for 2 4 hours 2 The shrine consumes a random item in the player's possession 3 The shrine duplicates a random item in the player's possession 4 The player becomes blessed by the god, gaining a +2 bonus to an ability score modifier of the DM's choice for 2 4 hours 4 . Corpse Mire You've been trudging through the marshland for a few hours now, and you've noticed the terrain becoming ever soggier and criss-crossed by thin, sludgy streams. Suddenly you step onto something that feels like a bloated balloon. Looking down, you are greeted by the vacant eyes of an elf corpse. Now that you look around, in fact, you realise that you have stumbled into a whole mire of corpses: men, women and children, humans, elves and dwarves. A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Survival) or Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals that the cause of death, in each case, was wounds caused by slashing weapons. The wounds have festered in the rank swamp, and a detect magic spell reveals that the bodies have been kept in suspended animation by a gentle repose spell. A successful DC 18 Wisdom (Survival) check uncovers tracks leading further into the swamp. These lead to a haven of hags, who maintain the corpse mire, which is the aftermath of an ancient battle, for their own nefarious ends (further details can be found in the Major Events section of this document). 5 . Injured Adventurer You can hear quick, low breathing and gasps of pain coming from the other side of a mossy knoll ahead of you. Following the sound, you find a dirty, dishevelled gnome half-submerged in the swamp, his face hidden by a grey facemask and hood. His lightweight leather armour has been painted with a mixture of greens and browns, which would provide excellent camoflague if he were not so blood-stained. It seems at some point he was an adventurer of some kind – now, though, he is clearly in dire need, and looks close to death. His horse, if he had one, has run off, and it seems any allies he once had have disappeared as well. He coughs as he beckons to you. “ Ack, if ye have a heart,” he says, “ can ye spare me a few potions?” If the party leaves the adventurer to die, or if they kill him, he comes back as a ghost to take revenge the players 24 hours later, and the party loses -1 Renown with the Zhentarim.

They also gain +1 Renown with the Zhentarim. 6 . Strange Nest As you make your way further across the swamp, you come across a huge collection of branches and logs that have been arranged atop a mossy knoll. It is, you realise, a massive nest, about fifteen feet in diameter, with an assortment of objects scattered around the centre. If any players enter the nest, roll 1d4 and consult the effects table below. Strange Nest Effects 1 d4 Effect 1 A peryton swoops down and carried one of the players off into the distance. 2 A dozen baby eagles hatch from their eggs and nibble the players. 3 The players find 2 d2 0 gemstones.

Trap: Spike Roof The creator of this dungeon has installed a deadly spike trap in the roof of one of the rooms. Any player that succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher spots the tripwire that activates the spike roof trap. If they do not spot it, all players in the 15 ft. cube area under the ceiling must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save. 2 . Trap: Trap Hole One of the floor slabs in this dungeon is really a cleverly disguised fake. The player at the front of the marching order must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check or have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher to spot the trap hole. If they do not spot it, the player at the front of the marching order falls into the hole and must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. A trapped player must succeed on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (player's choice) to escape, gaining one level of exhaustion each time they fail. They gain advantage on this check if another creature attempts to help pull them out, and they instantly succeed if they use climbing equipment like pitons or ropes. 3 .

If a player opens the door, roll 1d4, then apply the appropriate effect below: 1 d4    Effect 1 The player is teleported to a random area in the dungeon 2 The player changes sex for 2 4 hours 3 The player shriks to a Tiny size for 2 4 hours 4 The player gains truesight for 2 4 hours 4 .

Perhaps two dozen [ Side As] lie in various states of bloodiness about the room, with as many [ Side Bs] interspersed between them. It is impossible to tell who won this fight, or what the [ Side As] were doing this far from civilisation. If Side A is a faction and the players give them a proper burial, they gain +1 Renown with that faction; otherwise, they lose -1 Renown with that faction. 5 . Riddle Wall A dim blue light catches your eye in the room. Brushing aside the ivy that has crept over the walls, you find the source to be a short riddle inscribed in the wall in the Elvish tongue. It reads: If I’m glass, you feel everything, you're cruel if I’m cold – if I’m stone, you feel nothing, you’re good if I’m gold. What am I? If a player speaks the correct answer - 'heart' - in Elvish, the words flash with blue light and disappear. The player that spoke the answer gains 10 temporary Hit Points, and their attacks deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage for 1 hour. If a player declares an incorrect answer, the words flash with red light and that player is thrown backwards 10 ft., falling prone and taking 1d6 psychic damage. The words then disappear. 52 6 . Injured Soldier You can hear quick, low breathing and gasps of pain coming from a the chamber ahead of you. Following the sound, you find a dishevelled, blood-soaked knight propped against a wall, his face hidden by a blackened visor. Though his armour is dirty now, it was clearly once a brilliant silver with blue lining. His weapon, a fine longsword with a glinting edge, also looks expensive and well-made. At some point, he must have been a rich and successful adventurer – now, though, he is clearly in dire need, and looks close to death. He coughs as he beckons to you. “ Please, sirrah,” he says. “ Can you spare me a few potions?” If the party leaves the adventurer to die, or if they kill him, he comes back as a revenant to take revenge the players 24 hours later, and the party loses -1 Renown with the Order of the Gauntlet. If they kill him, the players can also take the knight's plate armour and keen longsword (attacks with this weaopn ignore resistances to slashing damage). The adventurer must be healed by 10 Hit Points to become stable. Players who attempt to give the adventurer a health potion must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to apply it, losing the potion and having no effect on a failed save. If players attempt to save the adventurer but aren't successful, the don't lose any Renown with the Order of the Gauntlet. If they are successful in saving him, read: The knight's breathing becomes more regular, and a little colour returns to his cheeks. He rises shakily, using his sword to steady himself. “ You’ve shown me a great kindness,” he says. “ Here – let me show you an old trick I used to know.” The party comes under the effect of the crusader's mantle spell for 3 hours. They also gain +1 Renown with the Order of the Gauntlet. 7 . Faction: Order of the Gauntlet Choose the faction event relevant for the players' relationship with the faction.

If any of the players have negative renown with the faction, read: Three heavily armoured knights block your way.

Otherwise, the knights fight until they kill the players or are killed themselves. Saviour Event. If any of the players have +1 or +2 Renown with the faction, read: A sudden series of yelps, swiftly following by a booming voice and the sharp sound of metal, catches your attention.

The one knight here is from the Order of the Gauntlet, and is fighting against four thugs. The players can help either side, which turns the opposing side hostile to them. If the players remain neutral, whichever side wins will flee, and the players lose -1 Renown with the Order of the Gauntlet.

If the players side with the knight and they win, read: The knight gives a hearty laugh and sheaths his huge sword.

But darkness is everywhere, and we must remain vigilant – stay wary! I will spread your names to my brothers and sisters.

This Lord's Alliance knight is honing his skills in the dungeon. If the players engage him in conversation, read: The knight’s eyes narrow. “ Say,” he murmurs, “ haven’t I seen you before? Just what are you doing out here anyway?” The player who has been most involved in the conversation must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw to convince the knight of the party's good intentions.

The players lose -1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance. If the players side with the knight and they win, read: The knight produces a handkerchief from his pocket and begins to wipe the blood away from his sword. “ Thanks for the assist, men,” he says gruffly. “ Damn dissidents are springing up everywhere like weeds.

Stranded Ship A brown dot appears on the blue horizon. Drawing closer, you realise it is a ship, its sails lowered, bobbing helplessly in the middle of the ocean. If you look closely, you think you can see a line of men waving at you on the edge of the ship. The ship's sails have been damaged, and it is too large to row by hand. The sailors are loathe to leave their precious cargo - crates full of rare spices, meats and wines - to be swallowed by the sea or pillaged by pirates. If players can think of a way to get the ship (or at least its crew and cargo) safely to port, the sailors will reward them with a cut from the trade amounting to 5d12 + 30 gp. 5 . Reveller's Ship For a moment you think you must be dreaming, but no – that really is the sound of cheering and out-of-tune singing you can hear coming from the ship ahead of you. Coming alongside them, you find the noises belong to a group of jolly revellers, who have already managed to get through seven kegs of ale as their ship bobs along and are happily uncorking a further eight. One of them notices you and beckons you over with wild hand gestures. The five men all greet you joyfully, passing out spare mugs of beer. “ You’re just in time for the drinking competition!” one of them shouts. “ Get involved, won’t ya?” The revellers will insist that either all or none of the party gets involved. If the party refuses, the revellers send them on their way. If the party agrees, they must attempt to drink the strong ale of the revellers. On each drink, each player must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, with the DC rising by 2 for each subsequent drink. After each check, one of the revellers will pass out. If any one of the players succeeds on all five saving throws, read: The final reveller sways dangerously. “ Yav gawt some reeeaaaal drinkin’ talent,” he slurs. “ Ya geet the graaaaand priiiiiiize!” The winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, a yellow cardboard crown which provides advantage to Charisma (Persuasion) checks. If a player fails any of the checks, they fall unconscious. If one of the players wins, the rest of the party wakes up. However, if the entire party falls unconscious, they wake up the next morning in the nearest port. 56 You wake to the stench of stale alcohol and other unmentionable liquids. You are slumped on the porch of a portside tavern, the name of which you do not recognise. However, the proprietor, a stout male dwarf, clearly recognises you, as he is attempting to brush you into the street with a broom. “ That’s quite enough o’ that, lads,” he says. “ Be on your way with you.” Each player wakes with 5 Hit Points and has lost half their coin along with a random piece of equipment or treasure they were carrying. However, they gain one reveller's badge, a small wooden badge that can be traded at any tavern or inn for a flagon of ale. 6 . Injured Whale You can hear a plaintive wail coming from some creature ahead of you. Following the sound, you come across a huge whale floating on the surface of the water. A long harpoon is jutting out of its side, with blood gushing from the wound. Without quick attention, this creature will surely die. If the party leaves the whale to die, or if they kill it, the party loses -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. The harpoon must be removed and the wound healed to save the whale, which can be achieved with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check or through the use of a spell such as lessor restoration. If players attempt to save the whale but aren't successful, the don't lose any Renown with the Emerald Enclave. If they are successful in saving it, read: After a few moments the whale ceases its wailing and begins to slowly swim away. Just before it plunges back into the depths of the ocean, it gives a low moan which seems, to you, to be tinged with gratitude. The party gains +1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. 7 .

If the players side with the Harper and they win, read: The man, still panting, looks you up and down. “ Thanks,” he gasps. “ That was a real help – I didn’t think I was going to get out of that one.

A trapped player must succeed on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (player's choice) to escape, gaining one level of exhaustion each time they fail. They gain advantage on this check if another creature attempts to help pull them out, and they instantly succeed if they use climbing equipment like pitons or ropes. 2 . Trap: Falling Tiles Loose roof tiles are a constant concern for any travelling through a city's poor district. The player at the front of the marching order must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher to spot the potential falling tiles. If players do not spot the falling tiles, they fall upon the entire party, and all creatures caught in them must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. 3 . Shadowmarks In a darkened alley, a thief's shadowmark glows with a faint green light. If a player approaches the shadowmark, roll 1d4, then apply the appropriate effect below: 1 d4    Effect 1 The shadowmark teleports the most valuable item in the player's possession to the nearest thief 2 The shadowmark teleports 3 d1 0 + 1 0 gp from the player to the nearest thief 3 The shadowmark teleports 3 d1 0 + 1 0 gp from the neasrest thief to the player 4 The player's attacks deal an extra 1 d4 necrotic damage for 3 hours 4 . Revellers For a moment you think you must be dreaming, but no – that really is the sound of cheering and out-of-tune singing you can hear coming from the street ahead. Coming around the bend, you find the noises belong to a group of jolly revellers, who have already managed to get through seven kegs of ale and are happily uncorking a further eighth. One of them notices you and beckons you over with wild hand gestures. The five men all greet you joyfully, passing out spare mugs of beer. “ You’re just in time for the drinking competition!” one of them shouts. “ Get involved, won’t ya?” The revellers will insist that either all or none of the party gets involved. If the party refuses, the revellers send them on their way. If the party agrees, they must attempt to drink the strong ale of the revellers. On each drink, each player must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, with the DC rising by 2 for each subsequent drink. After each check, one of the revellers will pass out. If any one of the players succeeds on all five saving throws, read: The final reveller sways dangerously. “ Yav gawt some reeeaaaal drinkin’ talent,” he slurs. “ Ya geet the graaaaand priiiiiiize!” The winning player is rewarded with the crown of banter, a yellow cardboard crown which provides advantage to Charisma (Persuasion) checks. If a player fails any of the checks, they fall unconscious. If one of the players wins, the rest of the party wakes up. However, if the entire party falls unconscious, they wake up the next morning in the nearest tavern. You wake to the stench of stale alcohol and other unmentionable liquids. You are slumped on the porch of a tavern, the name of which you do not recognise. However, the proprietor, a stout male dwarf, clearly recognises you, as he is attempting to brush you into the street with a broom. “ That’s quite enough o’ that, lads,” he says. “ Be on your way with you.” Each player wakes with 5 Hit Points and has lost half their coin along with a random piece of equipment or treasure they were carrying. However, they gain one reveller's badge, a small wooden badge that can be traded at any tavern or inn for a flagon of ale. 5 . Thief Along the crowded street, you feel a sudden bump as someone pushes past you. But you realise, as you dust yourself off, that the figure wasn't just bad-mannered - he's pickpocketed you! 60 The thief has stolen the entire coin purse of one player. Instigate a chase between the party and the thief, with the thief starting 30 ft. away. If the players catch the thief but let me escape, they gain +1 Renown with the Zhentarim. If the players kill the thief or have him arrested, they lose -1 Renown with the Zhentarim. 6 . Murder Mystery A sudden scream pierces the air. There is a flurry of shouting from the west, and a contingent of guards rush past you towards the sound. A chaotic sight greets you as you round the corner – guards, commoners, and nobles are all running to and fro, all giving a wide berth to the mutilated body that lies on the ground. It appears to be an elven woman with multiple stab wounds all over her body, though you cannot see much else from this distance. One of the guards is attempting to move the crowd along when he catches your eye. “ Are you the detectives they sent over?” he says. Players can attempt to succeed on a DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check to convince the guard that they are the detectives he seeks. If they fail, the guards ask them to move along. If they succeed, read: “ Come and take a look, then,” he says, shaking his head. “ Damn shame. We managed to pick up three suspects as they fled the scene, but I’ll be damned if I know which of them it was. Take a look round here and then I’ll take you over to the holding cells.” The players have one chance to investigate the crime scene. They can make Intelligence (Investigation) checks to determine information from the scene, based on the DCs below. Victim's Head DC Information 1 0 The victim’s mouth is still open, and her face has a faint expression of surprise upon it. 1 4 The victim’s lips have faint bite marks on them, as though she recently pulled away from a kiss. 1 8 The victim’s hair smells oddly of stale ale and has flakes of dead skin in it, lighter than her own. Victim's Chest DC Information 1 0 There are multiple stab wounds all over the chest, suggesting an attack of great passion. 1 4 The stab wounds are oddly precise, managing to piece both lungs as well as the heart. 1 8 The wounds are at an angle, indicating a curved elven dagger was used. Victim's Limbs Victim's Limbs DC Information 1 0 The victim’s arms have old bruises on them, seemingly from someone grabbing her forcefully. 1 4 The position of the legs suggests the victim was attempting to move away from the attacker. 1 8 A faint red mark on the left hand indicates a wedding ring must once have been there. Surrounding Area DC Information 1 0 The blood stains have a medley of footprints, but regular holes suggest a pole or walking stick too. 1 4 There are only two alleys out, but there’s plenty of drainpipes for agile folk to escape over. 1 8 A small amount of blue liquid is mixed in with the blood around the body. “ Let’s go see the suspects, then,” the guard says. It’s a short walk from the crime scene to the temporary holding cells, where three men – a young elf, an elderly orc, and a human with a burned face – all wait in separate rooms. “ Take your time,” the guard says. “ Hangings ain’t for a few hours.” Only one player can enter a room at a time, and the rooms can only be entered twice in total. The amount of information each suspect gives is dependent on the success of any Persuasion, Intimidation or Deception checks made by the players. At the DMs discretion, DCs can be reduced if players utilise alternating methods of questioning with the suspects. Potential leads of inquiry might include: • Whether the suspect had been drinking beforehand (only the human has, and he will only confess it at DC 16 or above) • How adept the suspect is with daggers, and whether they own one (all three have – the elf and orc will confess is at DC 14 or above, the human at DC 16 or above) • How the suspect knew the victim (the elf will reveal he is her current boyfriend with no check; the orc will reveal nothing; the human will reveal he is her ex-husband at DC 18 or above) • How the suspects know each other (the elf will reveal he is the orc’s adopted son with no check; the orc will reveal nothing; the human will reveal he knows the elf at DC 14 or above) The suspects will respond to questioning in the following ways, depending on the DCs listed below. 61 Young Elf DC Statement 1 0 You can’t keep me in here – you have to let me see her, you have to! 1 2 Please, I love her. Why would I kill her? You have to let me out, please. 1 4 I don’t know anything about this. She was a sweet girl who’d never done wrong to anyone. 1 6 If you think I did it, then someone must have framed me. There’s plenty who don’t – I mean, didn’t think I was good enough for her. 1 8 There was that one man in particular who kept following us a few months ago, though I never called the guards. He disappeared. 2 0 One night I caught him standing outside our window. Gods, that gave me a fright – and he with his burned face…I couldn’t sleep for days after that. But I didn’t see him after that incident, and I thought nothing of it. Elderly Orc DC Statement 1 0 I confess it freely – I murdered her. 1 2 I did it to revenge my son, whom she wronged. 1 4 Her entire family have been at war with my own for generations. 1 6 I stabbed her as often as I could. I didn’t even try to escape – I knew I would be captured. It was worth it to avenge the wrongs she did. 1 8 I stabbed her in the neck to make sure she would die. That’s how I did it. 2 0 I know for certain that young elf boy didn’t do it. I saw him at the other end of the square as I was preparing to do it. There’s no way it could be him at all. At least let him go. Burned Human DC Statement 1 0 I had nothing to do with it. They only stopped me because of my burned face. 1 2 I saw that elf boy do it with my own eyes. It was definitely him, ask anyone that was there. 1 4 That elf boy has a bad reputation around here. There’s plenty that’d believe he’d do a thing like this. 1 6 She was such a sweet girl. It’s a shame it had to come to this. I hope I get out in time to see that boy hang. 1 8 She didn’t deserve a low-life like him. I’m not surprised it came to an end like this – she should have stayed with me. 2 0 She didn’t deserve a low-life like him. I’m not surprised it came to an end like this – she should have stayed with me. Now, can you get me my medication? It’s a blue liquid in a flask, I know one of those damn guards took it. The real culprit is the burned man, who killed his ex-wife out of jealousy and attempted to frame her new boyfriend in the process. The elderly orc (the adopted father of the young elf) was attempting to shoulder the blame. No matter who the party picks, once they give their opinion of the culprit to the guard, read: The guard grunts. “ Well, I wouldn’t ‘ave picked him,” he says, “ but you’re the detective. Come on, lads – let’s get ‘im down to the gallows. There’ll be a big crowd out for this one.” He turns back to you. “ Almost forget – here’s your payment. Thanks for doing the legwork.” The party recieves 3d10 + 10 gp. If the burned human hangs then the party gains +1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance but loses -1 Renown with the Zhentarim; the opposite occurs if either the young elf or the elderly orc hang. 7 . Faction: Zhentarim Choose the faction event relevant for the players' relationship with the faction. If some players have positive relationships with the faction and some negative, use the Neutral Event. Neutral Event. If none of the players have positive or negative renown with the faction, or if players in the same party have both positive and negative renown, read the following: As you continue through the town, you notice a strange group of men and women in black robes and dull silver face masks, seemingly waiting for something. “ Keep walking, stranger,” one of them says, eyeing you suspiciously.

If any of the players have negative renown with the faction, read: Suddenly, a host of agile scouts in black clothing appear as if from nowhere – an ambush! These six Zhentarim agents use the spy statblock. They will allow the players to live if the players can provide them with particularly useful information or a valuable item. Doing so causes the players to gain +1 Renown with the Zhentarim. Otherwise, the Zhentarim fight until only one of them remains, who will then try to flee. Saviour Event. If any of the players have +1 or +2 Renown with the faction, read: The clamour of fighting and sharp shouts from the adjacent alleyway suddenly catches your attention. Following the sound, you come upon a group of agile figures cloaked in black battling with what appears to be a pair of priests. 62 The six Zhentarim agents here is use the spy statblock, and they are fighting two priests who worship Lathander. The players can help either side, which turns the opposing side hostile to them. If the players remain neutral, whichever side wins will flee, and the players lose -1 Renown with the Zhentarim. If the players side with the priests and they win, read: One of the priests bows his head to you. “ Salutations, strangers,” he says. “ You have our thanks for your assistance. Those Zhentarim defile the good laws of Lathander. Here – let us refresh you for your travels.” The party comes under the effect of the bless spell for 3 hours, but they lose -1 Renown with the Zhentarim. If the players side with the Zhentarim and they win, read: One of the robed figures gazes at you with an eye of curiosity. “ Well-fought, strangers,” she says. “ You have the Zhentarim’s thanks. Look to your future – we shall be in touch.” The players gain +1 Renown with the Zhentarim. Mission Event. If any of the players have +3 Renown or more with the faction, read: You think you feel something brush by your left hand side, but when you turn you see only the end of a black robe disappearing.

If they succeed, wait a few days before reading: You barely notice when a cloaked figure slips to your side and mutters, “ For services rendered.” As soon as he came he is gone, and in his place is a small leather pouch. A downwards- faced dragon, angry and gold, is emblazoned on the pouch. Mission Rewards 1 d8 Reward 1 -4 2 d2 0 gp 5 -6 Goggles of night 7 Gloves of missile snaring 8 Deck of many things 8 .

If any of the players have +1 or +2 Renown with the faction, read: From the adjecent street, a sudden medley of voices cry out and the sound of clashing metal quickly follows. Following the clamour, you soon discover a well-armoured knight attempting to cut down a large group of lightly armoured men. It is impossible to tell who started this fight, or who has the upper hand. The Lord's Alliance knight here is fighting against seven rebels, who use the bandit statblock. The players can help either side, which turns the opposing side hostile to them. If the players remain neutral, whichever side wins will flee, and the players lose -1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance. If the players side with the rebels and they win, read: One of the men wipes the blood from his forehead as he approaches you. “ Many thanks, strangers,” he gasps. “ That Lord’s Alliance knight has been hunting us for weeks. All we want is a vote! Is that too much to ask? Here – we were going to use these to fund a rally, but I think you’d better have them.” The rebel gives the party a pouch containing 2d10 gp. The players lose -1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance. If the players side with the knight and they win, read: The knight produces a handkerchief from his pocket and begins to wipe the blood away from his sword. “ Thanks for the assist, men,” he says gruffly. “ Damn dissidents are springing up everywhere like weeds. Seven dead, and tomorrow there’ll be thirty. But not matter.” He looks up at you and grins. “ Seven, thirty, a hundred – it’s just one after another to the blade, am I right? But I’ll not forget what you did here today. The Lord’s Alliance will hear of it, I can assure you that. Keep an eye out, lads – we’ll be in touch.” The players gain +1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance. Mission Event.

You can't prepare for moments like these; all you can do is embrace them with both arms and do your best to enjoy the ride. Detailed below are a series of events that carry a greater significance than your average encounter in some way. How players decide to deal with these encounters will often have long-term effects, particularly with relation to the various factions of the Forgotten Realms. As usual, these encounters are separated by terrain. Tundra - Mammoth Cheese After a few hours of trudging over ice and snow you hear the sound of clashing metal and the cries of men. Following the sound, you crest a hill to discover a strange sight: ten figures in black robes are beating a hasty retreat from a massive frost giant, which appears to be charging after the group with two mammoths in tow. The figures are loosing arrows as fast as they can nock them, and its unclear who will gain the upper hand here. The one frost giant and two mammoths are in hot pursuit of the nine archers, who are really Zhentarim agents. Helping the Zhentarim If the players attack the giant then it and the mammoths become hostile towards them. If the Zhentarim arches are all killed, the giant will loot their bodies for something and then flee with its mammoth pets across the tundra. If the giant and mammoths are killed, read: One of the swarthy men approaches you, breathless from the battle. \"Bloody hell,\" he says, \"didn't think we were going to get out of that one. No wonder mammoth cheese is more valuable than gold dust. Here - I'd say you've earned some.\" Each player gains two servings of mammoth cheese, which can be sold for 25 gp or consumed to provide +2 to the creature's Strength score and 20 temporary hit points for 1 hour. The party also gains +1 Renown with the Zhentarim, although it loses -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. Helping the Frost Giant If the players attack the archers then they become hostile towards them, but the archers will mainly attempt to flee the battle. If the archers are all killed, read: The frost giant eyes you warily, but, apparently deciding you aren't a threat, leaves you to inspect the bodies of the archers. Bending down, you can see it retrieves a series of yellow substances that look like a kind of creamy cheese. Placing the substance into its bag, the giant gives you a nod and gestures to the bodies. It seems it wants nothing else from them, and is offering you whatever remains. With a final nod, the giant turns towards the tundra once more. Amongst the archers are 3d10+20 gp and a variety of food rations, arrows, and even a few potions of healing. The party gains +1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave but loses -1 Renown with the Zhentarim. Staying neutral If the players don't take a side, roll 1d4. On a 1-2, the frost giant wins and, after looting the dead archers, flees into the tundra, ignoring the players. On a 3-4, the archers win and run off into the tundra, ignoring the players. Coast - Hydraman vs. The Roc After a few hours of trudging along the coastline, the wide sea stretching out beside you, the sound of rushed feet and small yelps comes from ahead. Soon a host of men, women and children, clearly dressed in a hurry and clutching an assortment of random household objects, appear from the rocks and start to rush further inland. Seeing you, one of the men shouts, \"Flee, if you've the time! The bloody idiots are at it again!\" Before you have time to respond, the screaming wings of a gigantic bird flurry up from the coastline and rise into the air. Bizarrely, you spot a man clad in armour upon which he has haphazardly attached a variety of feathers. The roc on which he flies gives a thunderous cry, and a cacophony replies: down at the shore, something is coming out of the sea. Seven huge serpentine heads begin to slither from the waves, and soon its gargantuan body emerges too. It's a hydra, and it, too, has an armoured figure riding astride it. \"It's over for you, Hydraman!\" the figure on the bird cries. \"You're mistaken, The Roc!\" Hydraman roars back. \"It is you who will meet your end here!\" This hydra and roc will then begin to fight one another, with both figures intermittently shouted out strange insults. Helping Hydraman If the players attack the roc then it becomes hostile towards them. If the hydra is killed, the Roc rider will laugh hysterically and fly off. If the roc is killed, read: 65 Hydraman gives a triumphant cry as his nemesis plummets to the ground. He beckons you over. \"My friends!\" he cries. \"Clearly you are of stout heart and true morals! Here - take this, as a symbol of Hydraman's friendship!\" Each player recieves a pendant of Hydraman, a poorly made necklace with an image of a hydra on it. The pendant requires attunement, and grants the player the ability to breathe underwater. However, the party loses -1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance. Helping The Roc If the players attack the hydra then it becomes hostile towards them. If the roc is killed, Hydraman will laugh triumphantly and fly off. If the hydra is killed, read: The Roc gives a satisfied laugh as his nemesis crumples into the sea. He beckons you over. \"Fine fighting!\" he cries. \"You clearly know true power when you see it. Here, this will be the symbol of your alliance with the mighty Roc.\" Each player recieves a pendant of the Roc, a poorly made necklace with an image of a roc on it. The pendant requires attunement, and grants the player a flying speed of 10 ft. However, the party loses -1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance. Staying neutral If the players don't take a side, roll 1d4. On a 1-2, Hydraman wins and stalks off back into the sea, ignoring the players. On a 3-4, the Roc wins and flies off, ignoring the players. The players can attempt to convince the madmen to stop fighting with a successful DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If this is successful, the villagers that were fleeing the scene return, and give each player a coastal token by way of thanks. The token allows players to bypass one speech check as long as they are in a coastal area. The party also gains +1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance. Desert - Nomad's Land After a few hours of trudging over dunes and ridges, you come to a wide area of flat land. At the bottom of the hill just below you, someone has dug a long, thin trench into the sand. You can spot a few armoured heads poking out from the top and arguing with each other. There are twenty Lord's Alliance soldiers in the trench, who all use the knight statblock. There is another trench 150 ft. away which contains twenty Emerald Enclave rangers, who all use the archer statblock. \"Be wary, friends,\" a man in chainmail armour calls to you as you approach. \"This is a warzone. The Lord's Alliance is trying to extend its beneficial influence further into this wasteland, but a few nomads have stopped us at every turn, setting traps, burning our camps, releasing our horses - and now this, a stalemate with nothing but a stretch of trap-laden sand between us. Say, would you join us in a push to get rid of these nomads once and for all?\" Helping the Lord's Alliance If the players agree to help the Lord's Alliance, the army rushes across the open land, with each soldier taking the Dash action on its turn whenever possible. For every 15 ft. of movement a creature makes across the open land, it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the explosive runes the nomads have set, taking 1d6 force damage on a failed save. Once the army gets within 60 ft. of the trench, the rangers will begin to shoot them. If the Lord's Alliance soldiers are all killed, the Emerald Enclave rangers will flee back into the desert, ignoring the players. If the rangers are all killed, the soldiers will reward the players. One of the soldiers approaches you. \"Mighty fine work,\" he laughs. \"We sure showed those sand- eaters! Here, take this for your troubles.\" Each players recieves 2d10 + 10 gp and the party gains +2 Renown with the Lord's Alliance. Helping the Emerald Enclave The players can attempt to cross the open land before the Lord's Alliance attacks. They must still make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw for every 15 ft. they move, taking 1d6 force damage on a failed save. If they arrive, they must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check to convince the rangers that they mean no harm. One of the rangers sighs heavily. \"In truth, we're glad you're here,\" he says, \"for we are in dire need. We have tried at every turn to repel these Lord's Alliance invaders, but they are relentless. If we do not stop them here and now, I fear they will subjugate our people and destroy the nomad way of life forever. Will you help defend our lives and our homes?\" If they agree, the players must defend the rangers from the Lord's Alliance soldiers as they charge the trench. If the rangers are all killed, the soldiers continue to march into the desert, ignoring the players. If the soliders are all killed, the rangers reward the players. 66 \"You've done a fine thing this day,\" one of the rangers says, grasping your shoulder. \"You'll surely be blessed for this. Though we've little in the way of coin to give you, this might aid you in your travels.\" Each player recieves a ranger's desert cloak, which provides advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide and on initiative rolls as long as the wearer is in a desert environment. The party also recieves +2 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. Staying neutral If the players don't take a side, roll 1d4. On a 1-2, the Lord's Alliance soldiers win and march further into the desert, ignoring the players. On a 3-4, the Emerald Enclave rangers win and return to the desert, ignoring the players. The players can attempt to forge an alliance between the two groups by succeeding on a DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check with both factions. If they do so, they recieve both rewards from each group, and the party gains +1 Renown with both the Lord's Alliance and the Emerald Enclave. Forest - Elven Ambush In a clearing ahead you notice what seems to be a band of adventurers, all armed, eating a quite supper around a smouldering fire. To the player with the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score – DM’s choice if tied – add: A slight rustling in the trees above draws your attention – looking up, you notice a thin elven woman, well-camouflaged in green and brown robes, creeping along a branch, arrow nocked in her bow. She places a silent finger against her lips as she sees you. Helping the adventurers At this point the party can attack the elven woman, in which case the four adventurers become the party’s allies but remain under the DM’s control. Combat is initiated at this point with eight elf scouts around the edge of the clearing, with the other seven (besides the elven woman already spotted) considered hidden. If the adventurers are killed, the scouts loot their bodies and disappear into the forest. The party loses -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave if any of the scouts survive. If the scouts are killed, read: One of the adventurers limps over to you. “ You were a real help there, mate,” he says brightly. “ Those damn elves been following us for days. Way we saw it, ancient goods that can be stolen, should be stolen, am I right? Here, take a share!” The adventurer gives the party four gems of brightness, but they lose -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. Helping the elf scouts If the party allows the elves to attack the adventurers, the adventurers become hostile and attack the players, assuming them to be allies of the elves. If the scouts are killed, the adventurers retreat further into the forest. If the adventurers are killed, read: One of the elves drops from a tree and bends his head to you. “ My thanks, strangers,” he says solemnly. “ These men had stolen something precious to our people. Please, take this blessing as a sign of our gratitude.” The party comes under the effect of the guidance spell for 3 hours, and gains +1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave. Staying neutral If the players don't take a side, roll 1d4. On a 1-2, the adventurers win and run off into the forest, ignoring the players. On a 3-4, the elven archers win and disappear into the forest, ignoring the players. Grassland - Tower Siege In the distance you can see a tall, thin tower, its high ramparts brightly lit by various torches. However, as you approach you realise the tower is not lit, as you assumed, by torches – the rooftop is ablaze and riddled with arrows. The source is a large contingent of dwarves who are laying siege to the tower. It is impossible to tell who is inside, but someone is mounting a counter-attack of arrows and spells, which are slowly picking off the dwarves below. There are eight dwarven footsoldiers and one dwarven war machine fighting against one Tower of Tu'mat and three tower guardians. The footsoldiers use the thug statblock, and statblocks for the other creatures can be found in the Appendix of this supplement. None of these creatures are initially hostile to the party. Helping the dwarves You approach one of the dwarves. “ Stand back if ya don't wanna get shot,\" the dwarf grunts. \"We’re gettin’ into that there tower. There’s apparently all kinds of magical junk in there. Now, if ya help us get past these nasty guardian things, we’ll reward ya with a share.” If the party sides with the dwarves, the tower and guardians become hostile, and the dwarves and dwarven war machine remain under DM control. If the dwarves are all killed, the tower shuts itself up and cannot be interacted with. If the tower guardians are defeated then the doors to the tower creak open. Read: 67 The dwarves cheer and one of them claps you on the back. “ Ya did good, sprouts,” he laughs. “ Come, let’s grab ya share.” The dwarf leads you to the tower entrance, where a contingent of dwarves stand guard, watching you with faint suspicion. In the darkness of the tower entrance, you think you can spot a few armoured bodies, and perhaps the symbol of a yellow crown. After a few minutes the dwarf returns with a heavy sack. “ Got some trinkets for ya,” he grins. “ Thanks again. Be seeing you!” The sack includes one necklace of adaptation, one potion of fire breath, one ring of warmth, and one deck of illusions. However, the party will also lose -1 Renown with the Lord’s Alliance. The dwarves will not allow the party into the tower, and will attack if the party attempts to enter. Helping the tower Alternatively, the party may decide to attack the dwarves, in which case the dwarves become hostile, and the tower and guardians remain under DM control. The dwarven war machine will only attack the tower, and if all the dwarven footsoldiers are killed it will drive away. Once all the dwarves have been killed, read: From the still-smouldering tower a man’s voice rings out. “ You have our thanks, strangers,” the voice says. “ Aid is not so freely given in an age such as this. Take a guardian of the Tower of Tu’mat with you where you go.” The party comes under the guardian of faith spell for 8 hours, or until they enter through a doorway not large enough for the tower guardian. They also gain +1 Renown with the Lord’s Alliance. Staying neutral If the players don't take a side, roll 1d4. On a 1-2, the dwarves win and take over the tower, ignoring the players. On a 3-4, the dwarves are defeated, and the tower becomes silent, ignoring the players. Mountain - Dwarven Fortress The sound of clanging metal and shouting voices can be heard from the northeast. Coming to the edge of a rocky cliff, you can see that in an open clearing below a fierce battle is being raged. A group of dwarven soldiers, heavily armoured and armed, are utilising a strange moving siege machine to attack a great stone fortress which has been hewn from the mountainside. You can’t see who is inside the fortress, but they’re putting up a strong defence, hurling barrages of arrows down onto the advancing army. There are eight dwarven footsoldiers and one dwarven war machine fighting against one Dwarven Fortress. The footsoldiers use the thug statblock, and statblocks for the other creatures can be found in the Appendix of this supplement. None of these creatures are initially hostile to the party. Helping the attackers You approach one of the dwarves, who gives a rousing battle cry when he spots you. “ Just in time, me lads!” he cries. “ Here to help us retake our fortress from those damned Macduffs, ey?” If the party sides with the attackers, the Dwarven Fortress becomes hostile, and the dwarves and dwarven war machine remain under DM control. If the attackers are all killed, the fortress shuts itself up and cannot be interacted with. If the Fortress is reduced to 0 Hit Points then the doors that lead inside are destroyed. Read: The dwarves cheer and one of them claps you on the back. “ Ya did good, sprouts,” he laughs. “ Let’s clear the rest of the buggers out! For the Macreedy clan!” Moving into the torch-lit entrance of the fortress, you see the advancing dwarves cutting down the remaining Macduff guards. You can see the glint of treasure at the far end of the massive hallway, but you also notice that dwarven women and children that are cowering by statues of old dwarf gods. One of the Macreedy dwarves, still laughing, raises his warhammer as he lurches towards the nearest family. The players may decide to try to stop the attackers at this point, in which case the attackers become hostile. If the attackers are killed and some defenders remain, skip to the bottom of the 'Helping The Defenders' section below. Otherwise: Once the slaughter is over, a blood-spattered Macreedy dwarf lugs a hefty sack towards you and drops it at your feet. “ For services renders,” he says. “ Glad to have those scum outta our place. Now you best scarper, or we’ll get you to scrub the floors!” The sack contains one deck of illusions, one gaulntlets of ogre power, one yellow diamond elemental gem, and one eyes of minute seeing. However, the party will also lose -1 Renown with the Lord’s Alliance. Helping the defenders Alternatively, the party may decide to engage the attacking dwarves, in which case the attackers become hostile, and the fortress remain under DM control. The dwarven war machine will only attack the fortress, and if all the attackers are killed it will drive away. Once all the attackers have been killed, read: 68 You can hear cheering and shouts of joy from inside the fortress. The heavy stone doors creak open, and a pair of armoured dwarves come out to meet you. “ Welcome, friends, welcome!” one of them calls. “ Our deepest thanks for your timely arrival. The Macreedy clan has long been attempting to destroy our people. You may have just saved our clan today. In light of that fact, we wish to offer you what do outsider has been allowed before – access to our mining tunnels. Through them, you can get to almost anywhere in this region safely and speedily.” The party can use the tunnels underneath the mountains to travel anywhere in the mountain area without the risk of random encounters. Whilst travelling in this way, the party is considered to be moving at a fast pace, and they cannot become lost. They also gain +1 Renown with the Lord’s Alliance. Staying neutral If the players don't take a side, roll 1d4. On a 1-2, the attackers win and take over the fortress, ignoring the players. On a 3-4, the attackers are defeated, and the fortress becomes silent, ignoring the players. Swamp - Hag's Haven After a few hours of trudging through the swamp you notice the air growing chillier, and the groud becomes covered in a rolling blanket of fog. Before long you come across a huge, blackened oak tree, its thick roots sprawled across the marsh. A gaping opening between two of a roots seems to be an entrance of sorts into the tree. Inside, you find the trees is really a hollow chamber, containing only a muddy mound in the centre upon which a makeshift altar of branches and moss has been constructed. You can just make out a collection of withered flowers, a candlestick, and what looks like an eyeball on the top of the altar. Then, as if materialising out of thin air, three beautiful elven women dressed in simple green cloaks appear around the altar. \"Come, weary travellers,\" one of them smiles. \"Rest easy here - we will keep you safe and renew your spirits, if you but watch over our holy place for a little while.\" These figures are really three green hags in disguise. Making a deal If the players agree to rest in the tree, the hags consider the decision to be the affirmation of a contract. The players' Hit Points, spell slots, and features are all restored as though they had taken a long rest if they decide to stay in the tree. However, the hags determine 'a while' to be rather longer than the players might have expected. As soon as you agree to the elven women's kind request, you feel a warm and pleasant light shiver over your body, and you soon feel as refreshed as though you had slept for days. However, this warmth is swiftly replaced with a sudden chill that cuts to your bones, and, to your horror, the three elven women begin to transform. Their milk-white skin soon flakes away to reveal a wrinkled and green visage, and their rustic robes turn to dirty rags. \"You are most welcome for our part of the bargain,\" one of them grins. \"Now for you to fulfil yours...sisters, we asked for a little while...how long is fair?\" \"Foul is fair,\" cackles another. \"It's been a few thousand years since the last guardians died...let's say a thousand and one years for these fine specimins!\" The hags then attempt to cast geas as a 9th-level spell (Wisdom saving throw to resist, spell save DC 13). Any players who fail the saving throw are compelled to stay inside the tree and guard it for a thousand and one years, aging but not dying; if they take any actions that are counter to this command they take 5d10 psychic damage (max once per day). A remove curse, greater restoration or wish spell ends this effect. If the hags' hag eye is destroyed (see 'Other Options' below) then the geas spell ceases to function for 24 hours. Any players who succeed on the saving throw are unaffacted. Attacking the hags Any player who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) or DC 24 Wisdom (Perception) check can discern that the hags are disguised. If the players attack the hags, the hags will attempt to kill the players. If one of the hags is killed, the remaining two will use their invisible passage feature to attempt to escape. Other options The eyeball on the altar is a hag's eye which any of the hags can use to see what is occuring inside their lair. If the hag's eye is destroyed, each of the hags takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours. If the players run away, the hags may use their invisible passage feature to attempt to follow them, as long as they remain in the swamp area. If players found the nearby corpse mire (see the Minor Events swamp section above) and consecrated it (for example, through the use of a hallow spell), then the hags do not attempt to make a bargain with the players, but immediately try to attack them. Treasure Inside the hollow twig altar is a variety of items the hags have collected, including 4d20 sp, one bag of holding, one driftglobe, and one potion of poison. 69 Dungeon - Barricaded Soldiers This encounter is designed to take place in a medium- to large-sized room, and you will have to adjust the details to suit the dungeon in which the encounter occurs. From the room ahead the sound of shouting voices is mingled with monstrous cries. Shadows from flickering fires conduct a deadly dance across the walls. This spacious room is a frenzy of battle, with reams of ghouls hurling themselves towards the eastern end of the chamber, where a group of knights are struggling to keep the creatures at bay behind the overturned tables they are using as makeshift barricades. There are three Order of the Gauntlet knights here, who all use the knight statblock, although they begin the battle at half their maximum Hit Points. They are fending off six ghouls initially, and, once these ghouls have been defeated, a further ten ghouls enter the room and attack the group. Helping the knights If the players fight the ghouls, the knights become reinvigorated. Players can attempt to order the knights to take certain actions, but it is up to the DM's discretion whether the knights will follow such orders. If all the ghouls are killed, read: One of the knights brushes the dust and blood from his battered armour. He raises his visor to look you up and down, revealing the face of a middle-aged human man. “ Came just in the nick of time, lads,” he says gruffly. “ You’re my kind of people. We were following a lead on some necromancy work down here, but looks like the wizards cleared out a few weeks ago. We’ll keep searching all the same. Thanks for the assist – here, let us give you some protection for your travels.” Each player comes under the effec to the crusader's mantle spell for 3 hours, and gains +1 Renown with the Order of the Gauntlet if at least one knight survives, or +2 Renown if all three of the knights survive. Staying neutral If the players don't take a side, roll 1d4. On a 1-2, the ghouls win and will remain in the room, attacking the players if they become aware of them; in this case, the players lose -1 Renown with the Order of the Gauntlet. On a 3-4, the knights win and continue further into the dungeon, ignoring the players. Ocean - Lessie After a few hours on the sea, you spot a small boat bobbing in the distance. Drawing closer, you realise it is occupied by a single elderly man, fishing by himself in an old straw hat. \"Have ye seen Lessie about?\" he calls. \"She's around here somewhere, I know it.\" The old man is looking for a mythical creature he has dedicated his life to capturing. Players can spend some time trying to help the old man spot the creature. For every ten minutes they spend looking for the creature, each player can make a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the creature. If any of the players succeed, read: You point to the shadow moving under the waves, and the old fisherman followers your gaze. \"Aye, I've got 'er!\" he shouts, throwing his fishing line out. A few moments later, with a monumental heave, the old man manages to pull the colossal shadow up to the surface. It appears Lessie is a huge sea-serpent of some kind, and it's not best pleased at being hooked. \"Quickly, now!\" the fisherman bellows. \"Hit it with everything you've got!\" Roll initiative, and consider Lessie surprised. Lessie uses the plesiosaurus statblock. On its turn, Lessie uses its action to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to escape the fishing line. The players must reduce the creature's Hit Points to 5 to make it docile. If Lessie succeeds on the check, it swims away and the fisherman will return to fishing, ignoring the players. If the players succeed in making Lessie docile, read: \"Aha!\" the old man cries. \"I've got ya now, Lessie dear! Finally my grandson will know I'm not just some old geezer!\" He looks over at you, beaming. \"You've helped me succeed in my life's work. I won't be needing this anymore - I reckon you should 'ave it.\" The party gains +1 Renown with the Harpers but loses -1 Renown with the Emerald Enclave (this is reversed if the party helps Lessie to escape at any point). The party also recieves the old fishing rod if they help capture Lessie, which can be used to collect a day's rations from any ocean, river or lake that contains fish (this process takes 1 hour). A player carrying the fishing rod has advantage on Charisma checks when talking to provincial folk. 70 Urban - Hostage Situation The sound of burly shouting and girlish screams draws your attention to the northwest. A large crowd of people are gathering outside a downtrodden, three-storey house. Guards are attempting to keep people away, and one man in particularly bright armour is shouting something towards the house. As you approach, you can discern that he appears to be bargaining with someone inside. “ Who are you lot?” one of the guards asks as you get closer. Players who succeed on a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check can convince the guard that they may be of some use in the situation. If they fail the check, the guard asks them to move along. If they succeed, read: “ Well, perhaps you can help with this hostage situation,” the guard says. “ It’s a messy one, that’s for sure. Go and speak to Captain Reynolds over there.” The captain squints at you as you approach. “ I told them not to let anyone near,” he mutters. “ Well, I suppose I couldn’t keep your division away from something like this for long. Damn it all, take the reins, then – but don’t mess this up like your lot messed up that robbery three months ago, you hear?” The captain takes a moment to calm himself, brushing the sweat from his temple. “ Now,” he continues, “ we’ve already scouted the perimeter. There’s at least eight of the bastards in there, and they’ve got three hostages with them. There’s maybe six rooms in this place, and the sight-lines are a goddamn nightmare. Way I see it, you’ve got three options: help me talk them out and do a trade for what coin we can gather up; see if one or two of you can’t shimmy up the side somewhere, maybe get the drop on them; or, as a last resort, we burst in and just try to kill them faster than they kill the hostages. I’ll leave it up to your…professional discretion.” Negotiating with the gang The gang desire the following: • 1,000,000 gp (reduced to 750,000 gp with a successful DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check, or 500,000 gp with a successful DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check) for all three hostages • A successful DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check reveals they will release two hostages if Captain Reynolds resigns, which he can be convinced to do with a successful DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) or (Intimidation) check • A successful DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check reveals that they will release one hostage for each guard that cuts off one of their own fingers (the guards can be convinced to do so with successful DC 22 Charisma (Persuasion) or (Intimidation) checks) If the party opts for the talkative route, their goal is to trade the hostages for what the gang desires. If the party has fulfilled one of the requests, they must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the gang that they actually have done so – on a success, the gang will release the number of hostages appropriate to the reward; on a failed check, the gang will kill one hostage and dump the body out of the window. If the party has not fulfilled one of the requests, they can attempt a Charisma (Deception) check to convince the gang that they have done so anyway, the DC being dependent on the number of hostages that would be released (18 for one, 20 for two, or 22 for three). On a success, the gang will release the number of hostages appropriate to the reward, and then kill the rest when they realise they have been duped; on a failed check, the gang will kill all hostages and attempt to escape. Repeat these checks until all the hostages are dead or have been released, or until the party tries another method. Infiltrating the building Coming around the back of the house, you notice a rickety drainpipe which leads up to an open window on the top floor. The pipe looks unsafe, and can certainly only hold the weight of one person at any one time. The pipe is 40 ft. high. Players must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity check to climb the pipe, and can move up to half their movement speed whilst on it. The check must be repeated each time the player wants to move. On a failed check, the player must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, falling 10 ft. but catching the pipe on a success, but falling all the way to the ground and taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 ft. fallen on a failure. Once a player reaches the top window the pipe breaks and falls away. To the player who has climbed the pipe, read: A solitary thug is leaning in the doorway of this room, facing away from you. He hasn’t noticed you yet, no doubt because of the raised voices downstairs. There doesn’t seem to be anyone else on this floor. Have the player roll a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the Gang Member’s passive Wisdom (Perception) to see if the player is noticed. Even if a fight breaks out, the noise below drowns out any sound of battle. Searching the room to the right reveals one of the hostages, bound and gagged. She can be released with no check needed, and will stay in the room until all the gang members are dead. In the room below you can see two more gang members arguing about what their next move should be. One of the hostages is at the far end of the room, bound and gagged. Another room is to the right of this one, but the door is closed, and you can’t see or hear who is on the other side of it. 71 If combat initiates, one of the gang members will grapple the hostage, telling the player to cease before he kills her. If the player does not stop combat, the gang member will use an action to kill the hostage, then re-join the fight. After three rounds of combat, two more gang members will burst in from the room to the right. Through the keyhole of the door you can see another two gang members, both fast asleep in their chairs. A set of stairs leads to the bottom floor. Have the player roll a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the Gang Member’s passive Wisdom (Perception) to see if the gang members wake up. If they do, combat is initiated, and the hostage downstairs will be killed. The bottom floor is one large chamber, in which two gang members and one burly fellow, presumably the leader of the lot, have created a makeshift barricade of long tables facing the front door. The hostage is being held behind this barricade by the leader. If combat is initiated here, the gang leader will spend the first turn using his action to kill the hostage unless he is incapacitated or killed beforehand. Combat then continues as normal. Attacking the building If players opt for a full-frontal assault, simply run the 'Stealth' scenario backwards. The gang leader will spend the first turn using his action to kill the hostage unless he is incapacitated or killed beforehand, and all other remaining hostages in the building will be killed on the same turn. Treasure Once the situation is resolved, Captain Reynolds will thank the party for their part and provide rewards dependant on how many hostages were saved and what the gang members were given. Use the table below to determine the rewards: Hostages Saved Reward 1 The party comes under the haste spell for 3 hours and is given 4 d6 gp, 6 d6 sp, 8 d6 cp. 2 The party is given Heward’s handy haversack and 6 d6 gp, 8 d6 sp, 1 0 d6 cp. 3 The party is given a small house in the town or city and 8 d6 gp, 1 0 d6 sp, 1 2 d6 cp. If the party saved a hostage by giving in to one of the gang's demands, they recieve only the monetary reward. The party gains +1 Renown with the Lord's Alliance if they save at least one hostage, or +2 Renown if they save all three. However, the party loses -1 Renown if all the hostages are killed. 72 Appendix A: Statblocks T he following statblocks are provided for the new creatures in this supplement, namely, the dwarven war machine, Tower of Tu'mat guardians, and the fortresses used in the Major Events section. 73 Dwarven War Machine Large construction, unaligned Armor Class 1 8 (natural armour) Hit Points 5 8 (9 d1 0 + 9 ) Speed 2 0 ft.
