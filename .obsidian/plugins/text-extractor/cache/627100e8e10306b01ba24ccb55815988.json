As a result, there are a few options for play: Each adventure can be used in a standalone way. Any time the adventurers are at sea, one of these adventures can be inserted into the set- ting being used. Alternatively, these episodes can be strung together into a larger, ongoing campaign. They have been written with this idea in mind, and the ongoing threat from the Far Realms creates the basic through-line to the larger campaign. Well-meaning DMs should also prepare their players: Because many of these adventures have a personal thrust to them (the betrayal of good friends, the splitting of one’s own personality, etc.), Dungeon Masters and players should communicate about how much each is com- fortable with. If, for example a player doesn’t want to temporarily lose the agency of their character, or if your players aren’t interested in PC vs. PC matchups, maybe the adventure needs to be tweaked. The episode numbers refer to the recom- mended order of play, if played as a whole campaign. But some may be moved out of or- der as needed. EPISODE 4: IMPOSTOR A delve into an ancient underwater dungeon brings back more than the adventurers ex- pected—one might say twice as much as they expected. ADVENTURE SUMMARY The party delves into an underwater dungeon, seeking treasure, glory, or the fulfillment of a commission to remove a minor threat. In the labyrinthine corridors and rooms of the sunken castle, however, ancient threats lurk. What the party does not realize is that this is the ancient stronghold of the lich-queen Maela- leine, the Chilling, who reigned over the region with terror thousands of years ago and was de- feated by her former lover Philip Verdane. As they delve through her tower, most of it is de- cayed with age, but a few clues may hint at the nature of the place, including the guardians Verdane left behind. Ultimately, however, the party may find themselves in the library, after passing by numerous threats and traps, where a large gem has been set and hidden. This gem contains Maelaleine herself, trapped by an im- prisonment spell. But anyone who gets close is himself cursed and split into two different creatures with a divided personality. The split will not be immediately apparent, especially as more pressing matters may come upon the party. But soon the existence of a double will become clear, as other creatures from the area have also undergone the same transformation. The only way to reunify a di- vided person (who is slowly dying) is to return to the cursed location and put the two halves back together. This conclusion may be gotten to quickly. The party may find out more as they go along. Maelaleine herself, if released, could share some information with the players, but would impose a heavy tax. Belfric in the town of Springhome can recognize who the lich-queen is and could protect the party from her traps, but she may enthrall them herself, as she will seek revenge upon Philip Verdane. RUNNING THE ADVENTURE To run this adventure, you need the D&D fifth edition core rulebooks (Player’s Handbook, Dun- geon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual). It might also be helpful to have a copy of Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, as several details of the adventure come from that book. But a T 4 SEA TRAVELING resourceful Dungeon Master can invent alter- natives as needed. Most of the monsters that appear in this adven- ture are from the Monster Manual (MM), along with new creatures and NPCs. When a crea- ture’s name appears in bold type, that’s a vis- ual cue pointing you to its stat block in Appen- dix A or its source book. Spells and equipment mentioned in the ad- venture are described in the Player’s Handbook. Magic items are described in the Dungeon Mas- ter’s Guide, unless the adventure’s text directs you to an item’s description in another book or in Appendix B. ADVENTURE HOOKS The promise of treasure or a deep delve into a dungeon never turned away a party of adven- turers. But to give a little more kick, some of the following hooks might draw the players more into the adventure. To attach this adven- ture further to the Sea Traveling adventures, it would be ideal for the party to have contact with Belfric in Springhome, and to see his li- brary with vast resources and intelligence. CONNECT TO SEA TRAVELING EPISODE 1 If you have run the first adventure in the Sea Traveling series, Where No Adventurer Has Gone Before, the ESP-er PC (or NPC), assuming they have survived, might feel a pull towards Springhome and the surrounding area as their ship passes by. A dull electric pulse thrums un- der their skin, telling them that there’s some- thing here, but they’re not sure whether it’s something that will be of immense help or im- mense harm in their campaign. PEST PROBLEM The nearby port city of Springhome has been harassed by denizens of this sunken structure. Bands of kuo-toa have been seen coming and going, and raiders among them have attacked, stolen, even killed and kidnapped citizens of the port. GLORY AND TREASURE Tales are told of the majestic treasure to be had in this ancient ruin, said to be the stronghold of a mighty, almost godlike king. His treasure room has never been found, but a ship in the area recently recovered gold coins with a very ancient stamp upon their faces. Perhaps the room is open! STRONGHOLD OF EVIL The ruin is the perfect hideout for a wicked mastermind of evil. Passing ships have seen strange lights, and some sailors will swear that ancient warrior-tyrant Drahn, who vanished before the downfall of his empire, became a lich and resides here, building up power to take control once again. If he can be destroyed here, his rise may be prevented. BELFRIC’S LIBRARY Belfric (a transmuter, from Volo’s Guide to Mon- sters—a 5th-level caster) is a neutral good wiz- ard who lives in Springhome. His library is a hodgepodge tower atop a cliff, wood and stone and brick and clay slapped together at odd places, sometimes looking almost literally slapped on, so that the tower appears as Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text. PLACING THE ADVENTURE As mentioned, these voyages can find a home in any sea-based campaign. It’s recommended that the party have their own ship and a base of oper- ations. The town of Saltmarsh in the Greyhawk campaign setting is an excellent choice, but any location with a need for seafaring adventurers will do. The sea upon which the party travels will need to be large enough that there are many uncharted islands and other locations. This ad- venture assumes the coast of a larger continent, or at least a land with a widespread population. Springhome, a side location in this adventure, can be almost any nondescript port city. Salt- marsh itself could be substituted for this location, and Keledek could serve in place of Belfric. IMPOSTOR 5 though it might collapse at any moment, with a lighthouse at the top, enchanted to illuminate the surrounding area whenever it is dark. The interior is all one room, with a spiral staircase in the center rising 50 feet up to the light itself. The walls are entirely bookshelves, filled with codices, scrolls, and tablets. A writing desk stands in the center of the room on a slightly raised dais, with a pile of scrolls and inkpots and candles to the side. Belfric’s familiar, a cream-colored short-eared owl named Veto, looms on a perch 20 feet up, but recovers books and scrolls at Belfric’s directions. Whenever asked a question, even a simple one, Belfric will answer only after flipping a few pages in a tome or running his finger several lines down a scroll. ACT I—TOO BEAUTIFUL TO IGNORE The entire keep once rested on a small island which has in the ages past sunken under the ocean. Most of it, in fact, is buried under a coral reef which has grown over it in the pass- ing millennia. All the walls and ceilings are covered in a layer of light blue coral, and fish and other sea creatures of numerous kinds call this place their home. Anyone who hopes to investigate this massive underwater castle had better have the means to survive underwater for extended periods of time. A party may find their own variety of means to solve this problem, but Belfric is able to cast water breathing on the party. He might even have interest in the treasure to be found. He will reward the characters for any magical items brought back at 125% sale price. Unless otherwise noted, the ceilings are about 10 feet high. Most of the rooms are illu- minated by the coral itself, which emits a faint blue glow in the absence of sunlight. This is considered dim light. The entry (area 1) is 30 feet below the surface. The Dungeon Master ought to keep their Dungeon Master’s Guide open to pages 116-117 and their Player’s Handbook open to pages 182- 183 and 198 for swimming and suffocating rules and underwater combat rules. The locations described are all identified on the map on pages 6-7. The only point of entry is a tower at the top of the sunken castle (area 1). Everything else is completely buried by coral and seafloor. 1. ENTRANCE This area once served as the watchtower of the stronghold. The outer rim contains the 50-foot- diameter circle, inside which is the 30-foot cir- cular tower room. The point of the cone is 20 feet high. The entrance into this room is an open archway where a door once stood. In the center of the floor is a trapdoor which is stuck. A DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check will open it. The staircase underneath leads down to area 2. Resting on a coral mound like a witch’s hat is a very old stone tower. Only the top portion is visible, and whether it has fallen off separately or the rest is buried underneath you can’t tell. The stone is crumbled and worn, with creeping coral and seaweed all around. All you can see is the crenelated battlement with a walkway cir- cling around a central cylindrical structure with a conical roof. An archway is open into this structure. 6 SEA TRAVELING STRONGHOLD OF THE CHILLING IMPOSTOR 7 8 SEA TRAVELING 2. GUARD AREA The ceiling here is 15 feet high. In the heyday of the stronghold, it was the place guards would gather as reinforcements to defend the castle. Arrowslits lined the walls at various heights, now overgrown in coral. The staircase is wide enough for guards to ascend two-by- two. The door on the western side (into area 3) was heavily locked and sealed. A DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the coral covering the door has been chipped away around the door’s outline, and the floor in front of the door shows signs of scraping. The door is also stuck. A DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check is required to open it. 3. ANNEX There is a kuo-toa monitor here. If the charac- ters have made any great noise before reaching the door to this room, it is in the corner above the door and will drop on the first creature that enters. Otherwise, it is at the top of the steps and will initiate combat immediately. The staircase leads down to area 4. 4. BARRACKS The staircase up leads to area 4, and the spiral staircase down leads to area 7. The doorways to the east and west lead, respectively, to areas 5 and 6. There are four kuo-toa and one kuo-toa whip in this area. The kuo-toa in areas 5 and 6 will enter the fray as soon as combat begins. 5. EAST BARRACKS There are two kuo-toa in this chamber, which will enter the battle in area 4 if and when that begins. Treasure. Buried among the coral are 3 gold pieces. The coins are more ancient than those currently minted, however, and are printed This circular room is 30 feet in diameter, with a wide iron staircase in the center. The walls are covered with a dimly glowing blue coral. A cy- lindrical section on the western side is closed off by stone and an iron door, both also covered in the same blue coral. Only ten feet in diameter, this small room fea- tures the top of a staircase near the western end leading down, a colony of glowing blue coral is most highly concentrated on the western wall and growing up the staircase. THE KUO-TOA FANATICS A small cult of kuo-toa occupies portions of the stronghold. They moved in not long ago, when a family discovered the entrance. Here they met the deathlock wight Shreif, who used their fa- natic devotion to manifest a religion quite quickly, in which they worship a figure they call Bayyglipsbllob. The jewelry that these kuo-toa are sporting emphasizes crab claws, squid and octopus tentacles, and eyeballs. If a creature manages to converse with the kuo-toa, most of their mad babbling will center on Bayyglipsbllob, prophecies about their god’s immanent arrival through his “servants in green” and the time when the whole world will be a tumultuous sea, and the exalted nature of refraction. The cult is made up of the following members, with their starting locations at the be- ginning of this adventure (they are also noted in the locations of the dungeon): 1 archpriest—area 18 1 monitor—area 3 2 whips—one in area 4, one in area 6 11 kuo-toa— four in area 4, two in area 5, one in area 6, four in area 20 4 kuo-toa zombies—two in area 7, one in area 11, one in area 14 This small chamber primarily features the iron staircase in the center, which has broken about halfway up. In the floor beneath it, a spiral stair- case leads down. There are two open arches, one on the west and one on the east, where doors once stood. Several small fishlike creatures are swimming about, and when they notice you, they surge toward you with teeth bared, bab- bling madly. This 20-by-20 chamber contains only a covering of coral, but small stone mounds in the floor show where some structures once lay. IMPOSTOR 9 with the face of a woman with severe features, dark hair, and a crown. 6. WEST BARRACKS There is one kuo-toa and one kuo-toa whip in this chamber, which will enter the battle in area 4 if and when that begins. 7. CHAPEL The skeleton is a deathlock wight, whose name was Shreif while alive. He served under Philip Verdane, but followed Maelaleine fol- lowing her betrayal. When she was defeated, Verdane killed Shreif and cut off all his fingers, and then raised him as a deathlock to guard her tower in banishment. The bodies are all zombies. Three human zombies are citizens of Springhome. Two kuo- toa zombies are former members of the cult. These monsters will make every effort to kill any creature that enters this area and turn them into zombies as well. The staircase upward leads to area 4. The staircase downward leads to area 8. The iron double doors leads to a ledge hanging over the floor in area 9. 8. NARTHEX Starting in this area, the depth is greater than 100 feet. So each hour spent swimming at this depth, for a creature without a swimming speed, counts as 2 hours for the purposes of determining exhaustion. The staircase up leads to area 7, the staircase down leads to area 18. The eastern doorway, which is open, leads into a corridor of door- ways: areas 10-17. The western doorway opens into area 9. In the corridor connected to areas 10-17, the following details can be shared: A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check allows characters to hear the sound of scratching and moaning from the other side of the stone wall. A DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check alerts creatures to the fact that this is the result of a stone shape spell, sealing up the doorway. The stone area has an AC of 17 and 18 hit points. Each of the rooms that make up areas 10-17 has a stone shape trap inside. In area 11 the trap has already been triggered. The details of the trap can be found in Appendix B. Each of the rooms also has a small, one-inch hole in the floor, which leads to area 19. This 20-by-20 chamber is decorated with the body parts of various sea creatures, octopus ten- tacles, fish heads, and oyster shells are uncere- moniously wedged into the coral on the walls. This vast chamber is 50 feet in diameter, and the spiral staircase in the center spans the 50 feet from floor to ceiling. Around the outer rim is a stone bench built into the wall. Two large win- dows are broken in the eastern side, with mas- sive colonies of glowing blue coral pushing through. A staircase continues downward be- neath the spiral staircase, and a set of iron doors hangs loose on the western side. Floating in the water all around this chamber are dead bodies, several humanoid, several fishlike, and one skel- eton with glowing green eyes and no fingers on its hands. A staircase up, a staircase down, and large door- ways to the east and west mark this as a simple in-between area. The space 30 feet by 30 feet, and the doorway to the west is emphasized, be- ing almost twice as large as that to the east and made of stone, while the doorway to the east is long decayed, remnants of what must have been wooden doors shown by the overgrowth of coral in their general shape. There are four doorways on the north side, and four doorways on the south side. Most are wide open, the doors having long since decayed. But the first doorway on the north side is warped and completely sealed in stone. The coral that lines the walls is absent from this space. At the far eastern end, the remnant of a massive door covers the whole wall, but all that remains is crumbled stone. 10 SEA TRAVELING 9. THRONE ROOM The floor of this chamber is below the 100-foot depth that expedites exhaustion. The throne is above that level. As the characters swim through this chamber, a way to balance out the timing is to count each hour as 1.5 hours for the purposes for determining exhaustion. But it can be called a wash just as well. The steps are trapped—coated with a sub- stance like sovereign glue. Any creature that touches a step activates the glue and is stuck instantly. Like sovereign glue, only universal sol- vent, oil of slipperiness, or a wish spell can re- move the bond. A creature can escape by use of an etherealness spell or by teleporting away. A DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check allows crea- tures to see hints to the glue’s presence: a dead crab stuck to the glue by its claws, or some sea- weed that is not growing from the steps, but stuck to them. There is a glyph of warding on the throne itself, which is triggered if a creature sits on it with- out speaking the passphrase: “It’s a game,” in Infernal. When triggered, the glyph casts sum- mon shadowspawn (Tasha’s Cauldron of Every- thing) at 5th level, specifying the Fury option. It understands most languages—for each one other than Common, Infernal, and Draconic, there is a 10% chance it doesn’t understand. Behind the throne is a hidden door, requiring a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice. Once found, a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check is necessary to push the heavy door open. In- side is a permanent teleportation circle. The doorway behind the ledge above the spikes leads back to area 7. In the height of Maelaleine’s reign, this was the usual site for executions. Should the grime be cleaned from the stained-glass windows, the following images are seen, in order from throne to door on the south side, then on the north side: 1. A skull-faced woman with silver crown and black dress, looking over her open jade-covered book, with dark magic streaming out from its pages 2. The same woman with silver crown and black dress, but with human flesh, severe and beautiful features, holding a crystal vial with a blood-colored liquid within it; in the background is a mass of black ten- tacles 3. The same woman with silver crown and black dress, with human flesh as in image #2, held in the embrace of a pale, dark- haired man with a robe covered in eyes and mouths, with a background of black- ness and stars 4. The same skull-faced woman with silver crown and black dress, holding a wilted flower between two fingers, various bones decorating the background 10. SOUTH GUEST ROOM 1 The entryway is trapped with a stone shape trap. It is otherwise empty. 11. NORTH GUEST ROOM 2 If characters are able to enter through the wall, they find the following details: The zombie is a kuo-toa zombie. Just beyond the door on the eastern side, mas- sive spikes protrude upwards, each 4 feet tall. A ledge hangs over them, over the entryway, ap- proximately 10 feet in the air, and behind it is a large set of iron double doors. A massive stone throne sits 20 feet high on a dais, 60 feet into this room. The stairs and floor in this room were obviously once of the finest marble, but now is chipped and coated in slime and seaweed. Three thick pillars line each side of the throne room, reaching the full 65 feet up to the ceiling, with a large window in-between each. The windows are covered in thick black ichor, their details long lost to time. The entryway to this 20-foot-by-30-foot room is only a simple archway. There is a one-inch hole in the center of the room. A fishlike zombie at the doorway attacks you as soon as you enter. There is a one-inch hole in the center of this 20-by-30 room. IMPOSTOR 11 12. SOUTH GUEST ROOM 3 This room is trapped with a stone shape trap (Appendix B). The room is otherwise empty. 13. NORTH GUEST ROOM 4 This room is trapped with a stone shape trap (Appendix B). The cage and room are empty otherwise 14. SOUTH GUEST ROOM 5 This room is trapped with a stone shape trap (Appendix B). There is a kuo-toa zombie here, who does not no- tice creatures entering at first, but will attack as soon as it does. 15. NORTH GUEST ROOM 6 This room is trapped with a stone shape trap (Appendix B). The room is otherwise empty 16. SOUTH GUEST ROOM 7 This room is trapped with a stone shape trap (Appendix B). Treasure. There is 1 gold piece among the coral on the floor. It is more ancient than those cur- rently minted, however, and is printed with the face of a woman with severe features, dark hair, and a crown. 17. NORTH GUEST ROOM 8 This room is trapped with a stone shape trap (Appendix B). The room is otherwise empty. 18. FOYER The staircase to the south heads down 50 feet to area 22. The staircase to the north heads down 50 feet to area 20. The stone door leads to area 19. It perfectly matches the walls, so that at one time it would have been perfectly flush and invisible. The door is only 4 feet high. This area is primarily occupied by a set of stair- cases, one going up and two going down. The space is 30 feet east-west and 20 feet north- south, with the upward staircase beginning 10 feet from the western wall. One downward staircase is near the southern wall, and the other is near the northern wall. A small stone door hangs open against the eastern wall, leading into a long chamber. Standing in the doorway is a plump, fishlike creature with pale eyes and dark flesh, holding a scepter made of the same glowing blue coral that decorates the walls. Clumsily tied atop the scepter is a mass of black tentacles. There is a one-inch hole in the center of this 20- by-30 room. There is a one-inch hole in the center of this 20- by-30 room. In the northeast corner sits a 5-foot- wide iron cage, heavily corroded and with sev- eral bars missing. There is a one-inch hole in the center of this 20- by-30 room. A fishlike zombie is swimming around the coral on the far wall. There is a one-inch hole in the center of this 20- by-30 room. There is a one-inch hole in the center of this 20- by-20 room. There is a one-inch hole in the center of this 20- by-20 room. 12 SEA TRAVELING A kuo-toa archpriest waits in the doorway. A DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check will allow characters to see that he is worn and beaten, not nearly at his highest level of combat-readi- ness. It has only 35 hit points and the following remaining spell slots: 1st level (2 slots); 2nd level (2 slots); 3rd level (0 slots); 4th level (2 slots); 5th level (1 slot). This is the result of its recent com- bat with the water weird in area 19, after which it decided that Bayyglipsbllob had set the elemental there for a reason, and the arch- priest partially healed them both. As it notices the party entering this area, it casts tongues on itself (resulting in 0 available 3rd level spell slots), and tells them that they will be sacrifices to Bayyglipsbllob, then enters combat, fighting them in this area and avoiding area 19. 19. SPY ROOM Each of the holes leads to one of the rooms above (areas 10-17). They are only about an inch wide, but they allow sound to be heard from the rooms above with ease. The trapdoor leads to a long straight staircase 30 feet down, which itself connects to a large spiral staircase that goes down another 20 feet into area 24. A neutral evil water weird lurks here, pro- tecting the trapdoor, and will not allow any creature through. It will not leave this area. Af- ter its combat with the archpriest (see area 18), it has 46 hit points remaining. Note that it is in- visible in the water. 20. DINING HALL This was a grand dining hall in the height of Maelaleine’s reign. The door to the west leads to the kitchen (area 21). The staircase leads up to area 18. A chuul is tearing apart the body of a dead kuo-toa near the kitchen door. Its stats are the same as those in the Monster Manual, except that its alignment is neutral evil, it only has 69 maximum hit points, and it will attack any- thing in this area, choosing not to leave if pos- sible. There are 4 kuo-toa hiding behind the stair- case. They will goad each other into feats of bravery (attacking the party) when the charac- ters’ backs are turned. If the party has already encountered the chuul in area 24, this is where it flees, and the party will come upon it facing off against the chuul in this area. The party will be able to see quite clearly that these chuuls are identical, in- cluding matching X-shaped scars on their fore- heads. 21. KITCHEN This room is empty. 22. DUNGEON This chamber is 60 feet long and 40 feet wide. The stairs lead back up to area 18. The door- way leads into area 23. The ceiling in this corridor is only 5 feet high, and it stretches almost 100 feet east. It is 50 feet wide. There are eight small holes in the ceiling, four on the north and four on the south, spaced about 20 feet apart. There is a trapdoor in the floor at the center of the room. The staircase opens onto a 60-foot long, 40-foot wide hall, with the remnants of a few chains hanging from the ceiling 30 feet up. There is an open doorway on the western end where a door once stood. Floating through the chamber are half a dozen bodies of eviscerated kuo-toa. Piles of stones line the walls in this chamber, which is 20 feet deep and 40 feet wide. The flesh of dead kuo-toa floats around, darkly staining the water. The remnants of iron cages stand like a forest of rust throughout this long chamber. The 30-foot- high ceiling hints that at one time this was meant to hold either many prisoners stacked atop one another, or else prisoners of a massive size. The bodies of four kuo-toa are present here, their limbs and throats crushed. There is one small iron door at the far end, opposite the stair- case. IMPOSTOR 13 The whole chamber is trapped. Every time a creature moves, there is a 20% chance that it will spring an entangling trap. From the near- est surface (wall, floor, or ceiling), writhing black tentacles leap toward the creature in a 20- foot square, starting from the point that was triggered. A creature in the area when it is trig- gered must succeed on a DC 15 Strength sav- ing throw or be restrained by the tentacles un- til rendered unconscious. A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check to free itself. If the tentacles are ever not grasping a creature, they retreat back into the wall and the trap resets. Only 4 it- erations of this trap can be sprung at a time in this space. The corpses are clues to the pres- ence of this trap, which can be detected by magical means, such as detect magic, which re- veals an aura of conjuration magic throughout the chamber. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check allows a character to see the areas of coral in the wall that have been disrupted by something rapidly and forcefully launching it- self from the walls. The use of dispel magic can temporarily suppress the effect on one half of the chamber, but it will reactivate in a number of minutes equal to 1d4 plus the caster’s spell- casting ability modifier. 23. DARK ROOM If a creature has the means to see in the dark, read the following: The text is written in Infernal, in a spiral pat- tern starting from the center and moving coun- ter-clockwise outward. It is a wild and insane babbling about betrayal and love, with many sections that have decayed too far to be legible, and the writer claims to have been bound captive here by “his Green Lady,” but he will reverse the roles and bring about the invasion of a being named Beyjix Merob, for he calls himself “her Master and Maker.” A DC 15 In- telligence (Religion) check recognizes the name Beyjix Merob as a supposed god from the Far Realms: Beyjix Merob, Who Sings Requiem Be- yond the Mirror. Like any of the beings from the Far Realm, their existence is in a great deal of doubt. No cult of Beyjix Merob is thought to currently exist, and that being’s name is almost always listed along with others, never alone. 24. LIBRARY This is the lowest point in the castle. A gem- stone at the center of the chamber emits bright light in a 20 foot radius, and dim light beyond that. The gem is a fist-sized pink topaz, fixed in place in the center of the chamber. It is affected by a light spell, effectively cast enough times to become permanent, so that it glows indefi- nitely, and brightly enough that it is impossible to see the gem itself very clearly. But creatures within 20 feet of it can see that it is a gemstone. If the light is dispelled, a creature with darkvision or provided with another source of light can see a tiny figure in the center of the gem, who appears to be a black-robed woman with a silver crown and beautiful dark hair. Although the party doesn’t know it, this is the There is a faint pink glow from a tiny point in the center of this chamber. The dim shadows cast show many objects floating in the water around you. This library is a circle roughly 60 feet in diam- eter. Paper, books, and scrolls float listlessly around the chamber. The ceiling is vaulted to a vertex 45 feet above the point of light. This light casts shadows on the faces of twin statues, each facing the light: To the south, an 8-foot angel with sword drawn and broad feathery wings; to the north, an 8-foot devil with batlike wings and thick, sharp fangs and claws. Beyond them and the light between them, four bookshelves line the east wall. Beyond the iron door, this room is dark. You can see the evidence of destructive scraping and clawing and hacking at the coral on the walls. But what at first appears random and mad scratching shows itself on further examina- tion to be a detailed circular writing in dark script. 14 SEA TRAVELING infamous lich-queen Maelaleine, the Chilling; also known in legend as the Consort of Chaos, the Wizard of the Cliff, the Green Lady, and Betrayer of the Mad One. It is up to you which names, if any, are known to members of the party. Untold eons ago, the mad warlock Philip Verdane locked Maelaleine within this gem by means of an imprisonment spell. Formerly they had been partners in evil, as well as lovers, but she had betrayed him. He fooled her into thinking he had forgiven her, and when her guard was down, he imprisoned her within the gem, and then toppled her entire fortress into the sea, preserving this room especially as a mausoleum where he could visit his former companion for eternity. Her phylactery is not present. The condition upon which she is freed from the gem is if a creature holding the gem says, “I love you.” Most of the books and paper floating in the chamber are illeg- ible due to the corruption of time. A few titles can be made out: The Crucible of Contemplation by Alconibas Frasier, and The Poor Works of Worm Powder by Wag Ig- ithalus. The books themselves are beyond re- pair. Further, there is one book floating in between the center bookshelves on the far wall. It is visi- ble with a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. The book’s cover seems almost to be made of dim jade stone, cracked and decorated with black runes and silver fire. This is the only in- tact book in the chamber, the Green Lady’s spellbook, Wexford. Maelaleine was a wizard of the Order of Scribes (Tasha’s Cauldron of Eve- rything), and Wexford is her awakened spell- book. However, after contact with Verdane and his deliberate corrupting influence, as well as the effects of time away from its mistress, Wexford has decayed. If anyone opens the pages, the book is blank at first, but then the words “I am Wexford” appear, followed by, “He always saw her in two ways: love and hate.” Speaking to Wexford yields no results. Writ- ing in him immediately vanishes, but may be responded to by insane babbling, all having to do with love and hatred and betrayal, and his own devotion to his queen. A DC 10 Intelli- gence (Arcana) check will tell anyone that this is a long-decayed wizard’s spellbook. More de- tails can be found in Appendix B. One might wonder how the materials in this room have been preserved for thousands of years, especially compared with the disintegra- tion of the other chambers. A DC 15 Intelli- gence (Arcana) check lets anyone know that a small amount of transmutation magic is being emitted from the gemstone, besides the other magical effects listed below. Closer examina- tion of the gemstone will show that it has been enchanted with an effect that preserves the en- tire chamber, although not perfectly. Behind the bookshelves, hiding and lurking, is a chuul. Its stats are the same as those found in the Monster Manual, except that its align- ment is chaotic neutral, it has only 69 maxi- mum hit points, and its primary motivation is self-preservation—it will flee before it fights. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check allows a creature to see the chuul trying to hide. The chuul also has a scar on the shell on its fore- head in the shape of an X. A forbiddance spell has also been cast upon the floor just beneath the gem (the password is “eternity” in Infernal). The spell will damage any celestial, fey, or fiend in the area that does not speak the password. Arcane glyphs are also present and nearly invisible on the floor around the statues and gem, so that anyone who passes within 10 feet of the gem is affected by a weird magical transmutation. Behind the bookshelves on the floor is a tele- portation circle. It can only be seen if a creature IMPOSTOR 15 stands within 10 feet of it, emitting a very dim white glow. Due to the forbiddance, the circle is inert. When a creature comes within 5 feet of the gem, the eyes of both statues suddenly flash red. Observers see the creature turn almost translucent for a moment, and the creature feels suddenly dizzy and cross-eyed, seeing double, before nearly blacking out. A DC 15 Constitution saving throw can prevent a total collapse into unconsciousness, but if the crea- ture fails, it falls unconscious. This magic can be triggered only in this location, and not again for 1d4 hours. The full effects are as follows: The creature should be secretly told that their alignment has changed, according to the Align- ment Shift table. In reality, they have been split in two halves, but the other half will not imme- diately manifest. The “Original” column on the table shows the alignment of the character before the effect. The “PC” column shows the new alignment of the character as controlled by the player. The “Other” column shows the new alignment of the twin character as controlled by the DM. (The last two columns may be adjusted accord- ing to the DM’s desire.)

Every hour, the hit point maximum decreases by 1d10. Nothing short of a wish spell can restore this loss, although temporary hit points can be added. Each half is wearing the same clothes and armor, but there is a 50% chance that any other piece of equipment is held by the other. If anyone touches the gem, or as soon as a creature is affected by this magic, the chuul darts away, grabbing the gem and trying to swim past the party and up the staircase. ACT II—THOUGHTLESS, BRUTAL ANIMAL If there is ever a moment at which the party splits up, the character who was affected by the gem’s magic should be taken aside and in- structed to play the two halves. One group gets one half, and the other gets the other. The party should play in a divided way until they learn what’s going on and try to reunite. You could manufacture a split by having a group of kuo-toa push part of the group out of a room and close off the entrance (deliberately or acci- dentally)—this could be in any of the rooms trapped with the stone shape trap, or any room that has an existing door or trapdoor. The “other” could then appear. For the party to learn more about what hap- pened to the chuuls and their fellow party member, and about the gem, Belfric would be the most obvious option. There is no check that can be made on the chuuls themselves, but the party should have enough clues to figure out most of what happened: the chuuls are identi- cal, they are weaker than they ought to be, and their personalities are opposite (you might con- sider describing the one found in the library as “gentler,” and the one found in the dining hall as “wilder” or “more brutal”). The same de- scriptions can be given of the party member who was split. The history of Verdane and Maelaleine is more akin to legend and myth, like King Ar- thur and Merlin. It’s up to you how much any character knows about them, and you might 16 SEA TRAVELING ask the players how much of the “history” they believe is true. Belfric, after paging through some old scrolls, would recognize the figure in the gem as Maelaleine herself, especially if Wexford is presented to him as well. Without Wexford, it will take Belfric 1d4 hours of re- search to come to this conclusion. He would extrapolate based on the general myth that Verdane defeated her that in fact he did not kill her, as was thought, but imprisoned her. He can inspect the gem further and discover many of the magical effects laid upon it rather quickly. He would know that the figure inside is trapped by an imprisonment spell, and would know the general means to free her (a dispel magic spell cast at 9th level). He would not know the other specified condition (see area 24 above). The transmutation magic that triggered the divide would be concerning to him. He the- orizes that in its original location, it might unite two halves that were split, but could just as likely cause a second split. He would hope that an experiment could be made of the pro- cess. In actuality, the process can be undone by this gem, if both halves can be brought to within 5 feet of the gem, while the gem is be- tween the two statues in the library. The same flash occurs, and the two halves merge into one. A DC 15 Constitution saving throw must be made. On a failure, the creature takes 2d8 psychic damage and falls unconscious. If either half is dead, the reunification can be at- tempted, but the saving throw is made at dis- advantage, and the damage increases to 4d8 psychic damage. If both halves are dead, reuni- fication occurs, but the reunified creature is also dead. ACT III—WE ALL HAVE OUR DARKER SIDE The “Other” half of the PC will resist reunifica- tion. They feel as though they have been set free from the “gentler” half, which they feel only held them back. Now they can pursue a more authentic life, and will look for alterna- tive means to survive. The gradual decrease in hit points will lead them to look for sources of temporary hit points, potions, spells, and more, and they will try to take control of the party, to lead them toward the goal of self-sufficiency. This half will know just as much about the transformation as the PC half at first, and can only learn more the same way the PCs do. They might therefore assume that they are the “real” creature, while the other is a false dupli- cate. Their aim at self-sufficiency might be driven by the thought that the gem cursed them in some way, so they will seek out magi- cal aid, especially a wish spell. This half will rise in paranoia if confronted. A party who persistently seeks to reunify the halves or otherwise go against their wishes will find a character who violently fights or in- sanely flees, depending on the alignment. It will be very difficult to bring such an individ- ual willingly to the process of reunification. ACT IV—CAN HALF A MAN LIVE? There are many timelines the DM should be tracking, but for many, it would be helpful to have the players keep the clock, especially the timeline underwater. For the gem’s effects, though, it could occur that multiple party members are split by the magical effect. Its timeline should be kept. Belfric will want to keep the gem safe after the events of this adventure. He will offer his own library as a secure holding place, where he will hide it in a locked box of lead while he researches more powerful magical means to keep it from magical discovery. If the party carries it with them, the transmutation magic will no longer affect them, but there is always the chance that they could free Maelaleine, and there is the chance that someone will come looking for it. Maelaleine, if freed, will keep herself dis- guised as a living person unless it is clear that the party knows who and what she is. She will use all the tricks in her book (literally if she can get her hands on Wexford) to enthrall them IMPOSTOR 17 and carry out a mission to find and destroy Philip Verdane. Verdane, meanwhile, occasionally checks in on Maelaleine, although no one knows he is still alive. If he finds that she is not where she is supposed to be, he will use divination magic to find her out and send attacks from various minions—orcs, pirates, undead, aberrations, and more—to recover her. 18 SEA TRAVELING APPENDIX A: MONSTERS & NPCS IMPOSTOR 19 APPENDIX B: MAGIC ITEMS & TRAPS WEXFORD Maelaleine’s spellbook, Wexford, is found in the Library. At first, the book is blank, besides the communication provided in the text of this adventure. Anyone who spends 1 week with the book after a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, studying it at least 4 hours per day, is able to unlock the spells contained within so that they become legible. Any creature who casts or copies a spell from this book, however, is cursed: each spell has a 5% chance of misfir- ing, instead casting blight on the nearest crea- ture to the caster at 4th level, using the caster’s spell save DC. If the caster does not have an available 4th-level spell slot, it uses a slot of the highest available level. There is also a 40% chance that whenever a spell is cast or copied from the book, the caster is paralyzed for 1 mi- nute, no saving throw. The curse can only be removed if the caster remains at least 50 miles separated from Wexford for 1 month, without casting any spells learned or copied from the book. Wexford contains the following spells: 1st level: detect magic, false life, mage armor, magic missile, ray of sickness, shield, thunderwave 2nd level: blindness/deafness, detect thoughts, in- visibility, Melf’s acid arrow, mirror image, ray of enfeeblement, web 3rd level: animate dead, bestow curse, counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, vampiric touch 4th level: blight, dimension door, stoneskin 5th level: Bigby’s hand, cloudkill, scrying, tele- portation circle 6th level: circle of death, disintegrate, globe of in- vulnerability 7th level: finger of death, plane shift, teleport 8th level: dominate monster, power word stun 9th level: power word kill It also details various features of the ritual by which one may become a lich, including the following necessary ingredients: 2 pinches of pure arsenic, 1 pinch of belladonna, 1 meas- ure of fresh phase spider venom (harvested within 30 days), 1 measure of fresh wyvern venom (harvested within 60 days), the blood of a dead humanoid infant killed by a phase spider, the blood of a dead humanoid infant killed by a mixture of arsenic and belladonna, the heart of a virgin humanoid killed by wyvern venom, 1 quart of blood from a vam- pire or a person infected with vampirism, the ground reproductive glands of 7 giant moths (harvested within 60 days). STONE SHAPE TRAP Magical trap This trap is activated when a creature touches a magically infused area of stone within an open doorway. This can be stepping on a stone floor, touching a stone wall, or something similar. This causes the open doorway to instantane- ously be sealed up into a rough wall as though affected by a stone shape spell. The DC is 14 to spot veins of almost liquid stone beneath the surface of the affected area. A spell or effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an aura of transmutation magic on the stone. Any living creature that touches the area trig- gers the trap. There is no save. The resulting stone area has AC 17 and 18 hit points.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
