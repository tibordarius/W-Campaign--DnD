They are vital to the world you’re setting, so make them fully ﬂeshed with deep stories to mine. They are also likely to be repeat characters in your stories, and so deserve to be memorable. This chapter will inspire you to add more complexity to your humble shoppe keep, and even give you three for you to steal wholesale. AGENTS OF COMMERCE Where there is a hungry stomach or idle senses you’ll ﬁnd people ready to fulﬁll those needs, in exchange for something else. Whether common coin is being traded, bags of wheat, or allotments of land, there will always be someone who makes it their art to get the upper-hand in the deal. After that dungeon is wiped clean, the villain picked of everything valuable, and the basilisk liberated of its fangs, the next task is to ﬁnd someone to buy them. Once you ﬁnd that person, it’s important to not get ripped off. Knowing whether those oils really are worth 1000gp will save you from a rather embarrassing failed resurrection spell later on. COMMON MERCHANT These are a hardy people, driven by aspiration, ready to stand in the perpetual rain or blistering sun protected only by the single sheet of cover above their stall. The evening brings long journeys out of town to purchase more fresh breads or newly minted swords, only to return and begin over again the next morning. COMMON MERCHANT Medium humanoid (any race), any alignment Armor Class 10 Hit Points 6 (1d8 + 2) Speed 30 ft STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 12 (+1) 10 (+0) 12 (+1) Skills Persuasion +3, Insight +2 Senses passive Perception 12 Languages Common, and one additional language (learned from trading with others) Challenge 1/8 (25 XP) Appraisal. The merchant has learned to recognise the value of the goods they come across. They can use the Appraisal skill with either their Intelligence or Charisma, both giving a +4 bonus. ACTIONS Dagger. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, 5 ft. reach, one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage. MASTER MERCHANT These artisan merchants no longer ﬂog their goods on the streets in run down markets. To ﬁnd one, you need only ﬁnd the most lavish shops in town, where only the best is sold. It wasn’t just hard work that drove the merchant to this point: creating a network of other tradesmen and wholesalers was an important part too. At this level of business it’s less about what you’re selling, more so who you’re it selling to. In their time, master merchants may have come across an uncommon magic item, which they keep to themselves for protection or utility. MASTER MERCHANT Medium humanoid (any race), any alignment Armor Class 11 (Leather) Hit Points 13 (2d8 + 4) Speed 30 ft STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 10 (+0) 14 (+2) 10 (+0) 15 (+2) Skills Persuasion +4, Insight +4 Senses passive Perception 13 Languages Common, and two additional languages (learned from trading with others) Challenge 1/4 (50 XP) 2 MERCHANTS Spellcasting. The merchant has learned a few spells to give them an edge in their job. Cantrips (at will): Mending 1st level (3 slots): Detect Magic, Identify Appraisal. The merchant has learned to recognise the value of the goods they come across. They can use the Appraisal skill with either their Intelligence or Charisma, both giving a +6 bonus. ACTIONS Dagger. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, 5 ft. reach, one creature. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage. APPRAISAL Keeping track of the ups-and-downs of prices for gems, weapons, or even food is not an easy task. Information quickly becomes out of date, and relies on keeping a constant eye out for the changing markets. Telling the value of an item will involve an Intelligence or a Charisma check and takes 1 minute taking a close look at the item. You should pick which skill before making your roll. The DC is set by the DM depending on the rarity of the item (and potentially the type of check). As a guide, mundane items will often require a DC 10 check. A proﬁciency is given to those with experience trading or purchasing, such as those with the Merchant background. Charisma is used when you are likely to have spoken to others in this business who have shared information with you, due to your likeableness. Intelligence is used when using knowledge of the local economy or deducing the price. Meeting or exceeding the DC will reveal how much the item can fetch both locally and in a larger city. Not meeting this DC reveals very little, but does give a very rough estimate. WELL KNOWN MERCHANTS There are a few merchants known throughout the world, but none as well known as these purveyors. Many people travel great distances looking for them based on just the whisper of them having a certain item. You may ﬁnd them around your world, or they may ﬁnd you. Either way, when they make their presence known, it’s best to follow along and see where their tale may take you. GII THE BOLD A round man whose expensive clothes no longer ﬁt him, though he’d never accept that he’d grown too big for them. He’s a brilliant merchant with a knack for ﬁnding what the customer needs, and more important yet, getting the item to them. Whilst none would call him anything as trivial as a smuggler, his ability to get goods over borders without harassment is legendary. He travels in a huge circus tent with enough space to serve as his living quarters and covered market stall of considerable luxury. Other merchants, desperate to be associated with Gii the Bold, are often found tagging along. Herds of twenty or thirty others will follow behind, bringing with them the numbers of a small village. “All these people? They follow me! The company is nice.” GOODS Gii always travels well stocked with goods expensive and not (and is always able to resupply from the hangers-on around him), however there are a few items he particularly wishes to shift, should anyone come browsing. 3MERCHANTS GII’S MARKET d8 Value Item 1 Low Music box which plays an interesting and especially distracting tune 2 Low A tube that magically stores any number of small, coin sized objects. 3 Medium 12 moonstones which ﬂoat towards magic items when they’re near 4 Medium A telescope that, when focused correctly, can see through walls 5 Medium Dagger made from the bones of a devil 6 High Eye drops which allow the user to read even the most complex languages 7 High A small, bronze whistle with the power to call forth a feline ally 8 High A glass plate, and spinning top, which spins until danger approaches, when it falters noisily WONDER IN ARTIFACTS The descriptions here are intentionally vague. I think you’ll have great fun coming up with back stories and rules for them, all of your own. Think about how Gii came upon the items, and why their previous owner lost them. It’s quite possible Gii found these or bought them blind, with no idea of how they work. He’ll use colourful language to sell them still, but maybe understanding the items is a quest chain in itself. HELPING THE BOLD The Crystalline Ermines. These creatures may look and behave like icicle ﬂecked weasels, but the ice continues right to their core: they are elemental creatures, born of the cold. They’re generally friendly and beautiful creatures, and as such are highly regarded as brilliant pets. Owning them is outlawed in every civilised society, however. They feast on ice for sustenance, and therein lies the issue: as the ice passes through them, the arcane is mixed with it. Frequently, their forgotten droppings turn into violent ice mephits - dozens of them wreaking havoc. Gii is known the world over for his ability to smuggle anything into anywhere, but he hit a snag on this latest job: he attempted to bribe the wrong guard. The strong-moralled guard refused and now seems to have a vendetta against the merchant, and is checking every crate that comes through the city borders. And so, Gii requires your adventurers’ help to smuggle the two crates - holding four sleeping Crystalline Ermines - into the city and to the customer. It’s not just avoiding the guards that needs to be done though, as whenever the merchants come to the city the thieves and gangers try to get a hold of whatever they can. MAPPING A CITY There’s no need to stress about maps. Players love a detailed town map, but they’re just as happy with a quick sketch. Draw an irregular circle on a piece of paper: this can either be your walled village or what the town considers their territory. Either way, a smart town will have guard posts dotted around this circumference. Add a few boxes to represent these. Draw in the gate (or gates). Then some more simple lines to represent key roads, then boxes for groups of buildings. Make sure there’s a couple of taverns and maybe a nice water feature. Add names to the buildings as the need comes up. Easy! 4 MERCHANTS SLIETTE OF THE FORGOTTEN COAST This elf, who’s taken on more of a ﬁscal adventure than most of her kind would, only deals in the rarest of magic items. Her band of Salvagers venture into dangerous places in search of the rumoured treasures within. Sliette almost never leaves her forest home, feeling the need to stay and protect the treasures personally. She sends Sailsmen and their boats far and wide with carved or sculpted mimics of her items for trade, to demonstrate them. If the customer wishes to buy they must travel to Sliette to pay and collect it, where she may or may not like the look of them. Whilst she is a person of commerce, she’s still an elf of the forest, with concerns for the balances of power. GOODS She’s said to have an enormous hoard of magic items that have been collected over the centuries of her organisation. They’re all for sale, though rarely cheaply. IN A SAILMAN’S TRUNK d8 Value Item 1 Medium A beautiful amethyst, said to have the power to open a doorway to another world 2 Medium A jar of oils from a shapeshifter, giving a perfect disguise when applied 3 Medium A large bag of dust, used to make items lighter 4 High Fairy Tears, which brings back to life even the most lost of souls 5 High Leather armor of a dead, famous ranger specialised for silence and agility 6 High A map, leading to the City of Lost Treasures 7 High A cunning sword, where a great ﬁghter’s soul is sealed within 8 High The tooth of a nothic, said to whisper the truth when it hears a lie JOURNEY TO THE FORGOTTEN COAST Sliette is not an easy person to get to, which is a testimony to the rarity of her products; still people are willing to travel, as there is no where else to ﬁnd them. A prince has become intrigued by an item that Sliette is selling, the Arbour Ring (a ring with power over entire forests, and all natives that dwell within). His mother, the queen, has no intention of indulging her son in his interests of the wilds (there are no lessons to be learned there that will help him with ruling), and so has forbidden him to go. He intends to go anyway, but needs bodyguards. Without the royal guards available, he calls upon adventurers. The journey to the Coast is a difﬁcult one, especially once word that the Prince is on the road has spread. Kidnappers, assassins, and even his mother’s men seem in every unexpected place. LONG JOURNEYS It is not a good idea to make travelling a trial without there being a good story for it; instead of using combat to show how dangerous the roads are, simply describe how the party was attacked but fought their way through regardless. Travelling doesn’t usually push the story forwards, and so spending a whole session doing it may feel like a waste of time. However, on this occasion, the travelling is the story. Try and have the players realise that their decisions on where to go, and how, should be more tactical than their everyday jaunt through the countryside. NEETS THE CASTEBREAKER Neets has a quick hand, an eye for art, and a heart much like Robin Hood’s. In Neets’ large folios is art that has been almost entirely pilfered from the homes or galleries of the greedy and rich. You’ll ﬁnd historic scenes which deserve to be available for everyone to see, or at least that’s what Neets thinks. Pure beauty on the page may catch Neets’ eye, but he’s always looking out for items of cultural signiﬁcance. Art which tells stories of the past, and teaches lessons everyone should learn. Not all art is plucked from the imagination of the 5MERCHANTS painter either - some have seen the scene with their own eyes, making the art more of a map or signpost to a forgotten place. Finding Neets is a task within itself as he’s always on the move, for obvious reasons. Those of a certain disposition, who keep their eyes open for cryptic marks and notches in buildings, may spot an underscored paint brush drawn in chalk; make inquiries to where Neets can be found there. Following the directions carefully will lead to a dimly lit alleyway in the poorest part of town, where the pictures will be hung on the stone walls for an hour or two for all to see, before they have to move on. GOODS Some items are too precious to be displayed out in the open air, but Neets is happy enough to try show them off when asked. A DARK FOLDER OF DELIGHTS d8 Value Item 1 Low Oils. The Battle Over Water, where a boy-king fought for his thrown 2 Low Pastel. Liberation of the Catpeople, an old piece of importance to a distant people 3 Medium Watercolour. A view from afar of a maze, with a temple visible in the foreground 4 Medium Acrylic. An old priest weighed down by two glowing rods 5 Medium Wax. A boy reading a book titled in a strange language. A shadow watches, waiting 6 High Oils. Huge and detailed painting of a cave wall, covered in prophecy 7 High Oils. An alter in front of a pair of golden gates, waiting for a donation 8 High Watercolour. A wizard lives amongst the scene, their soul clinging to the dark trees within THE SECRET POR TRAIT OF A HALF-BORN For better or worse, people take their cues from the gentry. One such family held in high regard are the DeLantee family, who pride themselves on generations of crisp human blood. This pride, in some, has turned to hatred of any of mixed race. Half-elves leave, or else cover their distinct ears, and try to keep their beauty in check. Half-orcs are never to be seen. Neets has it, that in their private collection the DeLantee family has an exquisite painting of their ﬁrst born, with pointed ears and more deeply shaded irises than a human should have. The child is rarely seen in public, but when they are they’re wearing hats and glasses. Liberating this piece serves two equally important purposes: the ﬁrst is that a ﬁne piece will be available for all to see, the second is that it may just rock the boat and show the people that \"perfection\" isn’t always pure. The DeLantee family are hosting an invitation- only gallery in two nights time. The portrait in question will surely be hidden away somewhere, though Neets has it on good authority that the it will be in the same building. Securing an invitation might be a good way in. Alternatively, a traditional smash and grab in the quiet of night is always on the table. MIGHT OR CUNNING A treasure room is rarely unguarded, especially when it’s a treasure room belonging to a family with means to pay for magical protections. When deciding how the vault is guarded, you should ﬁrst consider the type of game your players are after. If your players are looking for a good old fashion hack and slash, then maybe the vault is guarded by gargoyles who come to life as soon as they sense malicious intent. If your players are looking for a world building story, treat them to a magic lock which requires three items to be placed on a pedestal in the correct order - an arcane combination lock. Research into the family might be required, avoiding combat altogether. It’s important to check with your players to see what they want out of the game.
