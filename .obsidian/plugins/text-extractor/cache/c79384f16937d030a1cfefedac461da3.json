A recent earthquake has brought forth ancient evil from beneath the waves, to terrorize a sleepy coastal town. The heroes will sail to an ancient, steam-powered temple in the ocean. They'll encounter mad fish-men, deadly traps and ancient horrors that slumbered until now. Adventure Summary Sleepy Fishing Village. A strange but quiet fishing town, built in a cave. Ever since a recent earthquake, townsfolk have been disappearing. There are many rumours about the source: pirates, sea serpents, some accuse the civilized trolls that live in the village of eating people. But no one has definite proof. Enemies from the Deep. The true perpetrators are mad kuo-toa, led by mind flayers. A recent earthquake opened a path to the Underdark beneath the waves. The mind flayers have led an expedition to the surface, taking up residence in a derelict temple in the ocean. The temple is full of odd and wondrous steam contraptions. Freedom. Away from the elder brain, the Illithid’s psychic grasp on the large group of kuo-toa has weakened. A creature sleeping in the Pearlescent Temple has connected with them instead: The Godcrusher, an ancient evil that lay sleeping for ages until now. The Mind Flayers plan is derailed. Competition The Godcrusher commands the kuo-toa to gather slaves, bringing attention to the whole operation. The mind flayers are going along with it, but they search for a way of defeating the Godcrusher and regaining control of their fish servants. One-Shot If you're running this like a oneshot, read the following: The town of Ingpool is in trouble. People are dissapearing, and strange fish-creatures are the culprits. You've tracked the fish- men back to their lair: an ancient temple in a rugged bay. Your mission is to slay the fish-men and return the townsfolk safely home. Skip directly to Area 1. Statue's Base Initial Hook Ever since the recent earthquake, there have been reports of people going missing in Ingpool. The players may hear rumours and decide to investigate. They may just be passing through the town. Finally, they might receive a letter asking for help from one of three people below: 1. Gwen Veridot (female gnome noble) the mayor of Ingpool is offering a reward to anyone who can find out the source of the recent disappearances and bring back the missing people. She suspects that slavers may be working in the area. 2. Manner Saltspoor (male dwarf commoner) the innkeeper will ask the heroes to find his daughter Marga Saltspoor (female dwarf commoner). Recently the two had an argument. She usually camps at the Tidal Pools until Manner cools off. It’s been a few days, and Marga still hasn’t returned. Manner did a bit of searching in the area but couldn’t find her. He’s worried about her safety and will pay to have her returned. He suggests they search the Tidal Pools for signs of her. 3. Panzir (male troll) manages the smuggling operations in Ingpool for a criminal outfit known as The Black Oath. The players will receive a letter in the night that the ‘Good Neighbours of Ingpool’ request the players find their 'prized possessions' (shipment of illicit goods) and return it. The prized possessions were lost at the Tidal Pool, and players should start there. Folk in Ingpool are unwilling to talk about the 'Good Neighbours'. The townsfolk believe it’s best to keep out of the Black Oath’s business. Adventure Background The Area The adventure starts in the town of Ingpool. The coast around Ingpool is characterized by rugged cliffsides. Ingpool is the only good spot to get to the ocean for many miles. Travellers need to descend a switchback footpath down to the beach level, where they can find the entrance to town. Coral Boats The boats of Ingpool are of curious construction. A scant few are wooden, most are made from buoyant petrified coral that is unique to the area. The chunks of petrified coral are held together by pitch, plaster or a ground-up preparation of this coral material. This makes most of the vessels of Ingpool very colourful as the species of coral in the area are manifold. The most prized vessels in Ingpool are carved from single large pieces of coral. These one-piece vessels have a unique rainbow sheen and were gifts from merfolk many generations ago. Ingpool Population 270, mostly dwarf and gnome. There is a family of friendly trolls that have moved into the town and serve as its defence force. The village itself is delved into a coastal cave. The buildings are carved out of the cave walls, and the floor is smoothed stone. Most of the residential houses are carved and reinforced rooms, as the town has dug into the earth over the years to accommodate expansions. The Coral Mug The town's inn, the Coral Mug is the centre of social activity. It was initially a communal dining hall carved into the cave when the town was young. It’s since been converted to a large bar and is the main haunt for the fisherman in town. At any time, there are 4-20 creatures in this large bar: gnomes, dwarves, trolls and merchants. Rumors. Everyone in the inn is talking about the rumours. Boats have been washing up, empty. People are going missing. The mayor is organizing an investigation. Some believe that the recent earthquake was a sign that the gods are displeased, or sirens are drawing men to their doom in the shallows. Some believe that the friendly trolls living among the townsfolk are eating people. Smugglers. If the players somehow contact Panzir, he might be convinced to divulge more details about his lost shipment. The shipment was supposed to be traded off at midnight in the Tidal Pools. When Panzir arrived, the smuggling ship was already gone. Panzir found blood and thinks there was a scuffle. He thinks the perpetrators are a rival gang. Either way, most hooks should lead the players to the Tidal Pools. Anyone in Ingpool can tell players the Tidal Pools are farther up the coast and a popular spot to gather petrified coral. Tidal Pools This area north of the town is popular with locals. At low tide, the area is filled with small pools that contain stranded fish, octopus and pieces of petrified coral. When the heroes first approach this area, it will be low tide. Read the following: Travelling along the beach, you come upon the Tidal Pool. It's a collection of rocky outcrops, sandy patches and shallow pools. The pools contain a few fish or crustaceans that have gotten caught. Fist-sized pieces of petrified coral dot the area. A strong wind blows through your hair, bringing the smell of salt. A DC14 Investigation check yields some torn clothing snagged on a jagged rock in the Tidal Pool area. The cloth is stained with blood and a few days old. They also find thick mucus splattered about Fast Tides. Due to the many moons of this world, or curious tidal patterns in the area, going from the cycle between high tide or low tide takes approximately 2 hours. The tidal pools are submerged at high tide except for a rocky shelf. Shelf. If the players investigate the area, they can find some rocky shelves against the cliff. The locals use these shelves to camp or a dry place to climb if they get caught in the area at high tide. There are traces of many campfires an old ratted bedroll where people have camped out here before. Performing a DC12 Nature check, the players can determine that someone recently stayed here and there was a scuffle. Possible ways to find the kidnappers Kuo-toa scouts patrol the shore at night. Spotting such a creature is difficult, requiring a DC30 Perception check. If a single target loiters in plain view at night a kuo-toa slaver group will come to take the target. The slavers will fight to the death, but won’t pursue players towards Ingpool very far. If the players take pains to conceal themselves and watch the area, they encounter a kuo-toa slaving band at night. The band will have the composition listed below. If undisturbed, the slaver group heads several miles past the pools to a waiting coral boat. The kuo-toa will tie the boat to their octopus and haul the slaves to the temple. The players could follow but will need some method of sea travel to continue the pursuit. If they engage the kuo-toa at any point or are spotted, the kuo-toa will fight to the death. Kuo-Toa Slaving Band: 1 Kuo-Toa Archpriest , 5 Kuo-Toa Whip, 1 Giant Octopus. (3,500 XP) They are transporting three slaves in manacles. The players might willingly decide to get captured or get really unlucky in a confrontation with the slavers. In either case, they’ll get taken to the Pearlescent Temple and placed in the slave pens, their equipment taken. This scenario is a lot more complicated, so just make sure to read this adventure and go with it. Remember: give them a chance to get their stuff back and take the fight the kuo- toa. Slaving Band Outcome Searching the bodies. The kuo-toa's equipment is junk and worthless. The archpriest is carrying pearl necklaces, coral bracelets worth 50gp. A DC15 Intelligence (Religion) check reveals these baubles are religious accoutrements for the Great Ocean Goddess, An Intelligence (Local) DC15 reveals the location of a shrine to the north, reachable only by boat. The players can also ask around in town to learn the location of the Pearlescent Temple. Capture a kuo-toa. The players might capture one kuo-toa. If the players speak Undercommon they can converse with the creature. It won’t willingly divulge its lair's location, requiring a DC30 Intimidation check. It can be tricked into revealing this information through a DC15 Persuasion or Deception check and the appropriate argument. It’s also susceptible to most magic. The creature will willingly tell the PC’s that more attacks will happen, and there is no hope for surface dwellers. He won’t reveal any details about his masters but will say their ‘Godcrusher’ will destroy them all. He doesn’t know any details about the Godcrusher and won’t divulge anything further. 1 2 PART 1 | INGPOOL Wait for more patrols. The players can lurk for another 1 (1d3) days to try and catch another patrol. It will have the same composition as before, plus or minus a few Whips. The kuo-toa will also be much more careful now that they lost a raiding party. If they still don’t catch any leads to the shrine, see the \"If the Players can’t figure it out\" section. Other Plans The players might try some other plan, like pretending to be fishermen and hanging out on a boat in the ocean. In most cases, use the above slaver band to attack the party at night. The slaving party’s goal is to grab as many people as possible and pull them underwater to take back to their lair. PC’s can't figure out a plan You have a few options to keep things moving along: A slaving group simply stomps through the area, with three slaves in tow, no matter the time of day. Later that night, a slave escapes the shrine, gets back to town and babbles about a giant woman in the sea. This should lead them to the temple. The kuo-toa’s plan simply continues to progress as outlined on the timeline in Appendix A. Lost people return to the town, no memory of what happened. They poison the wells. Eventually, all the creatures in the Pearlescent temple attack the town (including Godcrusher) for mass abductions. They take their slaves back to the temple. The players try to call in backup The town has no military and the trolls have no interest in going to a 'cursed temple'. Tell them straight up if you have to: the heroes are the best qualified to deal with this, and they are on their own. Getting to the Pearlescent Temple It’s nearly impossible without flight to arrive at the Pearlescent Temple from land. The rugged coastline has no access points for hundreds of miles in either direction around. The only option is by boat from Ingpool. The mayor Gwen is willing to requisition one of the fishermen’s coral boats if the PC’s provide convincing proof they can solve the abduction problem and bring home her people. Panzir can arrange a loaner boat if the players can convince him his shipment is at the temple. Being a risk- averse, self-serving creature, he won’t go himself. Manner will ‘borrow’ a boat from one the local fishermen if they convince him his daughter is being held at the temple. He is a commoner, and will be a massive liability, but will insist on coming unless convinced otherwise. The village has no military force and there is a general sailor superstition of the area around the temple. It would be difficult convince any group of people to go there. Path to the Temple Once the PC’s set out, read the following: You set out along the coast in your vessel. The cliffs in this area are tall and rugged along your right. To your left, the ocean stretches out before you, vast and glittering in the sun. A cool salt breeze blows over you as you travel. Four hours pass as you take turns rowing. The beaches along the coast have slowly faded, replaced by sheer rock walls. The waves throw themselves wildly against those rocks, promising swift death to any boat that would draw near. For roleplaying, ask the players what the characters talk about during this four-hour trek. Ask someone to talk about the last time they rode in a boat. At this point have the players make Wisdom (Perception) checks. If a player succeeds a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception): You can hear strange bird-like cries from up ahead, but not any species you’ ve heard before. Players can make additional checks if they want to here like Intelligence (Nature). Any local knows those cries are either seagulls or Pteranodons. Pteranodons are massive leathery winged creatures that hunt fish and are generally non-aggressive. They’ve been in this area for as long as anyone can remember, and no one has ever heard of Pteranodons attacking a boat. Once you feel it appropriate, move things along: The coast here is more broken. You navigate between boulders and rock columns that are covered in tropical growths. You cross under an odd rock bridge formation that connects the coast with some nearby peninsulas, forming a semi-enclosed area. Massive leathery winged creatures cry overhead and roost in the cliffs around you. A few swoop into the water about 3 0 0 feet away, scooping up fish before taking off again. This enclosed area is about 400 feet wide, and 600 feet long before you can exit the enclosed area. (About 2x3 football fields in size.) There are 40 Pteranodons in this area. They won’t disturb the players. If attacked they will scatter to higher ground, and wait for the intruders to depart. A DC15 Intelligence (Nature) check can tell the PC’s these are Pteranodons, massive leathery winged creatures that live off fish and are generally non-aggressive. 3 Scaling the Cliffs. Approaching the rocks would be death for the boat, but a could swim up and grab hold of the rocks. Scaling the cliffs is an intense physical feat. The roost’s of these creatures are about 150 feet up, taking 5 DC 15 Strength(Athletics) checks to reach. Failure means no progress is gained, and a natural 1 means the character slips and falls, and without climbing gear (climbing gear prevents a character’s fall by more than 25ft) they plummet the full height of their progress taking 1d6 falling damage per 10 feet. The Nests. There are approximately 20 nests, each having 1d4+1 Pteranodon eggs and 1d2-1 Pteranodon babies. (53 egg, 17 non-combatant Pteranodon young on average). The eggs may be valuable to the right buyer. The most likely candidate in Ingpool is Panzir, who will take them at 20 gold each. The babies have no worth as they cannot be trained. Approaching the nests means the Pteranodons will swarm the intruder. 2 (1d4) Pteranodons arrive each round to attack the interloper up to the maximum of 40, only leaving the target alone once they are back in the water. The Pearlescent Temple Background Description The temple itself is a 300-foot tall statue of a woman in flowing robes, with a fish tail instead of legs. One arm is outstretched to the horizon and the other holds an open clamshell to her chest. A shaft descends the centre of the statue in a network of caves beneath the seabed. Purpose. The temple is dedicated to the three facets the Great Ocean Goddess. The temple used to be a meeting place between the aquatic and land civilizations of old. Dissolution of the Ocean Alliance. Eventually, the shared enemies of the land and ocean civilizations were pushed back into deeper waters. In years to come, the original purpose of the temple was forgotten. Now only a scant few pilgrims or foolish treasure hunters brave the dangerous passage to the temple. None have found the secret entrance to the lower levels in many hundreds of years. Godcrusher. The Godcrusher is a creature locked away in the temple for many years. Its prison was broken from the earthquake, and it has re-awoken. Its psychic power is greater than those of the mind flayers, and the kuo-toa now serve it. The mind flayers are content to bid their time until they find a way to kill the Godcrusher. Likewise, the Godcrusher is fine to grow its power until it can subjugate the illithid. If it succeeds, it plans to expand its budding empire. Approaching the Temple You can see an outstretched rocky hand cresting the tops of the cliffs. Rounding the last bend in the coast you see a gargantuan carving of a beautiful woman, stretching 3 0 0 feet into the air. She’ s as tall as the surrounding cliff sides. She has long flowing hair and robe, with a fish tail instead of legs disappearing beneath the waves. One arm is outstretched towards the horizon and the other hand hold’ s clamshell to her chest. 1 . Statue's Base As you approach the statue’ s base the seas get rougher and a light drizzle is falling. Massive plumes of ocean spray lance up the cliff-faces and the statue. High above, you can see faint light escaping the open clamshell. There's a chamber up there. Staircase. There is a staircase to climb the statue. The stairs are hidden in the crease of the statue’s robe. Players can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the stairway. Scaling the Statue. Scaling the statue is a difficult task, requiring a DC15 Strength (Athletics) check to make 15 feet of progress. This would take 13 checks to get to the clam. The players are subject to all the traps listed in the 'Saltslick Staircase' while doing this. Once they spot the staircase, read: You finally spot a promising sight: a stone staircase carved into the statue rises out of the dark waters and seems to wind upwards, heading towards some goal. You fear bringing the boat too close to the statue will get it smashed if a particularly bad wave kicks. The players will have to pull close then swim the rest of the way to the staircase. Swimming to the staircase can be challenging, but since there are no life-threatening conditions they can eventually succeed. Bringing the boat directly to the statue will get it smashed against the rocks. If the players are leaving the boat behind they can either carry it up the stairs somehow or anchor it. (there's a 50% chance that the boat will have broken its line for each day it's anchored.) If there is a local with them, he promises to come at dawn the next day to retrieve them. If they’re not there, Manner will come in after them. All others will simply give them up for dead. 44 1 a. Statue's Base: Underwater Crafty players might think to look underwater – if they do read: Beneath the waves is an entire ecosystem. You can only see about fifty feet in any direction. The bottom of the bay is covered are coral formations, multi-coloured and alive with undulating growths. Dotted among them are more mundane sea kelp and boulders. You can see a collection of fish swimming about. Any creature with passive perception 14, or one actively looking underwater for entrances, spots the secret entrance to the temple (see 1b Coral Entrance): There is a natural opening in the base of the statue about 4 0 feet down, concealed by the surrounding growths. It appears to head deeper into the earth. 1 b. Coral Entrance You swim through a narrow crack that leads deeper into the earth for about 3 0 feet. The tunnel then bends back upwards in a U, and you can see a dim glow coming from a chamber above. The coral entrance emerges into the floor of Area 4. Entrance Hall. 2 . Climbing the Staircase The statue is 300 feet tall, and a slick staircase rises 200 feet of that distance around the statue’s outside, finally arriving at the clamshell chamber. While on the staircase, the heroes are in danger from the natural ‘traps’ of the area described below. Complex Trap: Salt-Slick Stairway (level 5-10th, dangerous threat) The Ascent. The staircase is winding and takes approximately 10 minutes of laborious climbing to reach the top. The ascent is dangerous as ocean spray, wind and slick footing threatens the players. Ocean waves are particularly troublesome at high tide. The ocean spray event will trigger at 50ft, and every ten minutes the heroes spend on the exterior there is a 20% chance it will occur again. Constant Elements For every ten minutes the player remains on the stairway, there is a 20% chance the ‘Base Spray’ event will occur. (This should only matter if they stop here to perform some complicated operation, take a short rest, etc.) Active Elements Base Spray (trigger: first-time players reach the 50ft mark.): A particularly nasty blast of spray smashes into the statue, threatening to sweep the players off. The players must make a DC15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to keep their footing and avoid being swept off the stairway. If a player succeeds, they successfully maintain balance. If they fail their check, they lose their footing and are swept off the edge of the statue, falling and taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage as they belly flop into the ocean below. Pteranodons Revenge (trigger: approaching 100 ft. mark, only if they disturb the Pteranodon’s earlier): If the players disturb the Pteranodons earlier, then a rogue flock of Pteranodons swoops in for their revenge. (The number of Pteranodons can be as many as the player). Everyone must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. On a failure, they are caught unaware as salt and spray obscures their vision. On a success, that player spots the Pteranodons as they’re swooping in 30 ft. away. They can take an action before the Pteranodons attack. If the Pteranodons get in melee with the players they will attempt a Grapple check with a +1 Strength. If the player succeeds, they avoid getting grappled and the Pteranodon flies on. On a failure, the player is scooped up by the flying monster’s talons. If no countermeasure is deployed, the player will be dumped out in open space and fall belly flopping into the ocean below, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage. Any surviving Pteranodons will lurk in the nearby cliffs and wait for their quarry to re-appear, repeating this event later. Thrown into the Ocean. (trigger: failing one of the previous events and dropping into the ocean.): The player is thrown from the statue and smashes into the water, descending deeply and becoming disoriented. They must swim to safety or drown. Have the player make a Strength(Athletics) check at DC12. Success means they swim to the surface and safely make their way to the staircase. Failure means the player is Suffocating as they’ve lost access to air and are being tossed around in the waves, unable to surface or make progress. They have a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round) to succeed a Strength (Athletics) check to make it to safety. (Don’t forget to give your other players time to act in the meantime, possibly heroically diving off the statue to save their friend.) If time’s up, at the start of its next turn the suffocating creature drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and on each of their turns begin rolling death saving throws until they can breathe again or have drowned. Countermeasures Base Spray Countermeasures If an adjacent ally succeeded their Dexterity save, that player can attempt a DC15 Strength (Athletics) to catch their ally and save them from their fall. 5 On a success, the falling player is shaken but otherwise unhurt and pulled back up. On a failure, both the would-be saviour and imperilled character are pulled over the side to a mutual fate. The players may chain this as much as they want, adding 5 to the DC for each previous failure. Clever characters’ who have spider climb, stake themselves to the ground or some otherwise inventive solution should get an advantage against the Dexterity check to avoid getting knocked off. Pteranodons Revenge Countermeasures If the players were for some reason watching out for aggressors from the sky, give them an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) check. Spotting a Pteranodon and killing it before it grabs the player is an effective countermeasure. Similarly, once the players are out over open space the Pteranodon will let go. It’s up to the player to remain holding on. With an opposed Strength check, they can hold on. On their turn with a DC 15 Dexterity check, they can steer the Pteranodon and crash it back into the staircase, taking 11 (3d6) damage and killing the Pteranodon as they smash into the stairway but are otherwise back on the statue. Thrown into the Ocean Countermeasures Ther are few countermeasures once a character is in the ocean. Casting a spell here should require a DC15 Concentration check. Swimming to the nearby boat should be easy if it's nearby. The Dungeon Here are a few notes about the features throughout the Pearlescent Temple. Light Crystals Throughout the temple are glowing crystals that provide a sea-green illumination like a torch. They radiate no magic. Coursing through each crystal is a powerful electrical current that naturally creates a glow. In the distant past a protective film covered each crystal. That long ago eroded leaving a dangerous trap that could kill a regular person. Each crystal has AC 12, 4hp and is immune to psychic and poison. Any creature that touches a crystal must make a DC 10 Constitution save. On a failure, they take 11 (2d10) lightning damage or half that on a success. If the creature is standing in water or touching the crystal unintentionally it has disadvantage. Finally, whenever a crystal is smashed, 1d6-1 crystals de-activate nearby. They no longer emit light and are no longer dangerous. Stone Doors have AC17, 18hp and are immune nonmagical slashing and piercing weapons, psychic and poison damage. Wooden Doors have AC15, 18hp, are immune to psychic and poison damage. When stuck the door requires DC 14 Strength checks to dislodge. This process takes 1 minute per check and is noisy. If you feel it’s appropriate, have nearby creatures come to investigate, or roll to see if the sounds attracts wandering monsters. Copper Devices Each device in the Pearlescent Temple (pipes, pumps, cogs and the like) has AC 12, 4hp. When its destroyed, roll on the following table to determine what happens: Copper Device Effects Roll(1 d6 ) Effect 1 Empty. Nothing but a hollow whistling sound comes out. If this is a pipe, tiny creatures entering it could travel inside. One direction leads to a hidden exhaust port on the outside of the statue and the other to a burst pipe in the boiler room. 2 -3 Frigid Water. A frigid spray of water blasts outwards. Targets within ten feet must make Dexterity DC1 2 save or get knocked prone. The water quickly loses pressure and just dribbles out of the opening after that. 4 -5 Hot Water. A jet of scalding water blasts from the broken device, targets within ten feet must make Dexterity DC1 2 save or take 8 (2 d6 ) fire damage and be knocked prone. The water quickly loses pressure and just dribbles out of the pipe after that. 6 Steam. A gout of scalding steam explodes out from the pipe, boiling skin and stinging eyes in a ten-foot radius. Targets within ten feet must make a Constitution DC 1 5 save or take 1 2 (3 d8 ) fire damage and become blinded for 1 round. This area of effect remains for 3 (1 d4 +1 ) rounds. 6 Random Encounters Random encounters are determined by rolling a d12+d8. If the players attempt a short rest, make a roll. If players attempt a long rest, make sixteen rolls. If they are being particularly noisy, make a roll if you want to apply more pressure. If they’re dilly-dallying or spend 30 minutes in a location doing something, make a roll. On a 17+, they have a random encounter. On a 15-16, have a near miss i.e.: you roll on the table and the creature selected is patrolling or searching for the players, doesn’t find them. Play up the tension. Roll on the table to the right by rolling a d12+d8 to determine exactly what is encountered. Cursed Caverns When the temple was abandoned, the merfolk put a curse on the caves. Piesa confounds intruders of all types. The dungeon will seem normal the first time the players enter, but behind the scenes you'll be doing the following: Whenever heroes move through a new passageway, roll on the Random Rooms table. The room rolled is the room players move into. You cannot roll the same room twice. Mark rooms already traversed. If you roll a room the players have already visited, look at the next highest entry on the table. The players travel to that room instead. Mark off the Entrance Hall and Living Caverns, as these are the room's the player's explore initially. Rooms don't shift behind the players. If the players backtrack, they end up in the rooms they've previously traversed. When the players take a long rest, clear the markings on the Random Rooms Table. They can now roll and travel to any room previously cleared. Roll for random encounters each time they enter a previously cleared room to see if anything has re-populated this room. Random Rooms Table Roll (1 d1 0 ) Dungeon Room 1 4 . Entrance Hall 2 5 . Living Caverns 3 6 . Boiler Room 4 7 . Central Cavern 5 8 . Coral Chambers 6 9 . Shore Chambers 7 1 0 . Stingroom 8 1 1 . Slave Pens 9 1 2 . Godcrusher Shrine 1 0 DM's Choice Roll Encounter 2 -3 Malfunction. Aftershocks of the recent earthquake rock the room. All objects in the room break down and trigger the ‘ copper device’ effect. If no equipment nearby, then tremors trigger a cave-in. DC1 2 Dexterity or take 3 d8 bludgeoning from falling rock, none on save. 4 -5 Business as Usual. 1 mind flayer and his entourage of 4 kuo-toa encounter the players while they were on route to another area. Either they were performing business as usual or patrolling for intruders. 6 -7 Dearly Departed. 3 Drowned Ones (stats as banshee’ s, but their saving throws are Charisma-based.) wander into the area, following the presence of life. They can pass through any doors or walls obstructing their way. Three save or die wails could easily be deadly. If the party is defeated here have them fail-forward: wake up stripped of gear and captured by the kuo-toa. 8 -9 Crab Battle. 3 Chuul approach, seeking out the Godcrusher foes. They’ ll attempt to drag someone off, preferably with magic equipment, to be stripped of gear and thrown into the slave pens. 1 0 - 1 1 Deadly Dessert. 2 Black Pudding slip into the area, trying to find a meal. They can squeeze through small cracks to reach the players. They are hungry animals, and once they've got a meal they'll leave. 1 2 - 1 3 Extended Family. 3 Sea Hags(coven) sisters. These hags have come to claim the temple as their lair. They’ ll negotiate with the players, either offering something the players need in return for a ‘ favour' or offering to team up with the players to kill the remaining kuo-toa. If the players accept the kill the kuo-toa deal, the hags will betray the players at the first opportunity. If they accept the favour, one of the players will be cursed with a black spot and must deal with the hags in the future. 1 4 - 1 5 Brass Bulls. 3 Kuo-Toa Whip and 1 gorgon. The kuo-toa found a brass bull (stats as a gorgon). The bull is an ancient defender of the temple and has its own programmed patrol path. The kuo-toa are just following the bull and can’ t get it do anything specific. The bull will ignore the players unless they attack it, but the kuo-toa will engage and try to draw the players towards the bull. The kuo-toa won’ t stick around if the bull is moving on. 1 6 - 1 7 Hungry Squatters. 2 seas trolls move towards the players noisily. These creatures had been living in the caves and are avoiding the kuo-toa, but have been pushed to the point of starvation. They'll eat anything. 1 8 - 1 9 Rogue Elements. A static charge fills the air, alerting the players to danger. 3 nearby pools begin to swirl and form 2 Water Elementals. If no pools are nearby the elementals were created elsewhere and are wandering the caves. 2 0 Repair Job. The brass golem (stats as iron golem) is inspecting equipment in the area. See Area 6 . Boiler for details on golem. 7 3 . High Shrine The staircase enters the clamshell along the statue’s wrist. It’s a semi-enclosed space, open but hooded on one end that allows a stirring of wind and dampness to fill the shrine. Read the following: You enter the interior of the clamshell. It smells strongly of salt and earthy mould in this room. The floor is flat and made of grey stone and the roof curves like the outside of the clamshell. Mossy growths cover the walls and ceiling in the back. Through the moss covering the back walls, you can see intricate murals and runes carved into the rock. A 6 ft. diameter stone sphere is set on the floor in the centre of the room. A short staircase around the backside of the sphere brings you up three feet. Four roughly cut crystals are set in the walls and emit a green glow that bathes the chamber. There are several items in this room players could investigate. Mossy Backwall The faded scripture along the walls can be read when the moss is cleared. If the player understands a suitable exotic language, (Ex: Primordial, Sylvan) allow them to decipher the text. Alternatively, maybe the language is a dead one and another solution must be found: Someone casting Comprehend Languages or with the appropriate class feature could decipher this otherwise dead language. Making a DC15 Intelligence check and spending 1 hour studying the dead language could let the player interpret the names of all six deities mentioned, but not the context. Scripture Text. The scripture is faded and worn but speaks of the three facets of the Great Ocean Goddess: Aesa the bountiful provider, Daesa the wild storm, and Piesa the keeper of the deep. It tells the story of how the triumvirate goddess vanquished her greatest foes. Aesa united the other facets against Sekolah the shark god. Daesa drove Demogorgon’s merrow minions back to the Abyss. Piesa pulled the Kraken deep into the ocean to sleep. Finally, it tells the reader that pilgrims seeking a blessing should stand before the seed of divinity and speak each facet's name. This is referring to the pearl. Pearl. Climbing a short staircase puts the character before the stone pearl. The pearl itself is a perfect stone sphere six feet high. Looking closely, flecks of silver can be seen on sphere along with chisel marks. This ‘pearl’ used to be plated in silver but looters long ago scrapped the precious metal off. Standing at the pearl, you see out the open side of the room to the vast ocean horizon. The pearl itself radiates Abjuration magic. Standing before the stone pearl and speaking the names listed on the walls has various effects. All of them will only happen once, except for Piesa which will work every time. Pearl Effects Command Word Effect Aesa The pearl glows softly, filing nearby creatures with a peaceful feeling. Any creature in the area is affected by the Bless spell for 8 hours. Daesa Waves of water pour forth from the base of the pearl in pulses. The pulses grow in intensity over a period of 1 minute. One last blast of water emits from the pearl, and anyone standing on the pedestal needs to make a Strength DC1 5 check or be blasted back ten feet. If a creature remained on the platform for the full duration and succeeded their check, the gods are pleased. The water coalesces into a giant octopus. The octopus is friendly and will follow the commands of the player for 8 hours before dissolving into a puddle of water. Otherwise, the pulses cease and the room is filled with a calm breeze. Piesa A strong wind blows through the room, bringing a strong smell of salt and kelp. A low rumbling sound fills the chamber. In the back of the room, a secret door in the wall slowly drops downward over the course of 2 4 seconds, revealing a shaft. If spoken again, the stone doorway will rise from the floor, sealing the passage over a minute period. Sekolah Blood begins seeping from the ceiling in a slow but steady drip, bathing the room in crimson for 1 hour. It flows out the open end of the room and dribbles down the statue. This blood attracts 5 Giant Sharks that will patrol the area around the Temple and attack anyone entering the water. While this is occurring, no further words can be spoken. Demogorgon The crystal’ s illuminating the room change from green to red light, and black smoke pours from the base of the pearl for an hour that smells of brimstone and burnt hair. It fills the room and roils out the clam opening, obscuring vision as a ‘ fog cloud’ spell. No further words can be spoken at the pearl until these effects ceases. Kraken A lightning strike splits the horizon, and thick storm clouds form in the sky. A torrential thunderstorm begins, increasing the ocean’ s chop to hurricane levels. For 1 hour, the ‘ Base Spray’ trap now reaches 1 5 0 ft, and DC2 0 Dexterity(Acrobatics) are required to remain on the statue’ s exterior when the trap triggers. Swimming in the ocean requires a DC2 0 Strength(athletics) check. At the end of the hour period, the storm clears almost instantly. No further words can be spoken at the pearl until it these effects ceases. Any of these effects can be ended with a Dispel Magic spell. 88 Lights. These lights shock creatures that touch them as outlined in the Dungeon section. De-activating all the lights in the room will de-power the mechanism keeping the stone door closed, and it will slowly drift open (downwards). Secret Door. Searching at 30x30 area takes approximately 10 minutes. The players searching in the back area of the room need to make a DC15 Intelligence (Investigate) check. If they do reveal the following: There is a thin gap in the stonework at the back of the room. Clearing away the moss reveals the outline of a stone door. You can feel a faint breeze coming through the crack, and the sound of gurgling reaches your ear. There are no obvious handholds, knobs, or switches to open this door. There are several options for getting the door open Smashing the door down (see ‘stone door’ entry earlier). This will alert creatures below that there is something afoot, and obviously, the door cannot be closed again. Casting a knock or dispel magic will open the doorway for 1 hour. Afterwards, it will seal shut again. Speaking the command word Piesa at the Pearl in the centre of the room will open this door. Smashing all the lights in this room will cause the door to de-power and open. It cannot be closed after this. 3 a. Water elevator You stand at the top of an incredibly deep shaft. The walls of the shaft are smooth and slick. A soft breeze whistles up from the depths, and the faint sound of water gurgling reaches your ears. A square platform of coral is slowly rising towards you from below. The water elevator is 10ft square chamber, that has a 250ft shaft descending into the bedrock of the bay and the temple’s hidden interior. There is a square coral platform in the shaft that is about a foot thick and the same area as the shaft, forming a kind of floating cap. The height of the water is controlled by a sophisticated pumping system. The High Shrine entrance is at the top of the 250ft shaft. When the platform is near, characters can safely step out onto it. Otherwise they'll need to drop down. Over a period of 2 hours, the platform will descend. When the coral platform arrives at the bottom of the shaft, a previously secret door into Area 4. Entrance Hall will open: A hidden stone passageway in the wall before you slide open, revealing a square stone chamber. The secret door will close within a minute and process will repeat. The kuo-toa on the other side of the door are immediately alerted to the sound of the door opening. Underneath the Platform. Players could conceivably get underneath the coral platform. At the very bottom of the shaft are two passages submerged in water. On one end is an open natural tunnel, and the other a large copper tube. The natural tunnel stretches on for 500 feet until it opens in the deep water of the bay. In the centre of this tunnel are a series of large, bladed pumps. Anything getting caught in these pumps while they are running would take 70 (20d6) slashing damage. Dealing 50 points of damage to these pumps would destroy them, and de-power the whole facility. While de- powered all lights in the temple are inactive, and the Trial of Piesa trap cannot function. Swimming against the flow of the pump takes a DC 25 Athletics check while in the tunnel. In the other direction, the large copper pipe quickly splits again and again into smaller and smaller piping. It becomes small enough for only a tiny creature to fit through. If a tiny creature did choose a pipe to travel down, after 18 (5d6) minutes there’s a 90% chance a creature would end up in the bay through one of the exhaust pipes and 10% chance to end up in the boiler, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage from the immense heat and pressure. From there a creature would be driven through the facility for another 18 (5d6) minutes before ending up in the bay. At any point, a creature could attempt to break a tube wall. If successful they end up in a random room in the dungeon. 4 . Entrance Hall Read if the players just entered from the elevator shaft: Exiting the secret door, you enter a rectangular room from the east side. The room has 1 0 ft high ceiling. The walls are covered in algae. Sickly-green crystal glow in sconces around the room. The floor is slick with water. On the west side of the room is a square pool of water that descends downwards. A stone passageway on the north wall leads out of this room. Metal pipes emerge from the floor, ceiling or wall at various points. Some vibrate occasionally, some drip water, and some appear to be nearly red-hot. There are a collection of fish-men creatures in this room. Two are on raised platforms facing the western pool, and the rest are scattered around the room. They’ ve all turned towards you surprise. After a moment of silence, the room is filled with a chorus of croaking and trilling as they heft weapons. Breaking any piping causes the effects listed under ‘copper devices’ in the dungeon section. Ranged attacks that miss its target have a chance of striking these and area of effect attacks are guaranteed to trigger them. There is a rune on the wall next to the northern hallway entrance. When pressed by a living creature it activates the ‘Trial of Piesa’ trap. Through the northern hallway, after 30ft there is also a lever system that activates/deactivates the trap. 9 10 Kuo-toa guard this room. They will attempt to immediately trigger the Trial of Piesa trap, willing to sacrifice themselves to kill the players. (500 XP) Complex Trap – Trial of Piesa Complex trap (level 5-10, dangerous threat) This room was meant to foil intruders. This trap might be challenging while dealing with the kuo-toa. Keep your sentences short and quick while running the trap. The kinetic energy here is critical, don’t let your players waffle too much, and don’t allow extended conversation. Trigger: Armed by a switch from the main cave or by an emergency rune in the trap room. Say the following when the trap is activated: There is a gentle chime that rings nearby. If you haven't already, roll for initiative. How the trap acts on each turn is described below. Active Elements Sealed Entrances (initiative 20, once): The secret eastern door, the pool in the western side of the room, and northern hallway are sealed shut by large stone slabs. Read the following: There is a heavy grinding noise all around you as thick stone slabs seal each exit of this room with a thud! Thud! Thud! (bang on the table while narrating each thud if you feel like being cute.) Water Fill (initiative 10, every round): Cold water flows into the area via 4 copper pipes. Each round, the water level will continue to rise (see the dynamic element, Rising Water.) The first time this event happens, read: The pipes in the room vibrates violently and spew high- pressure water onto the floor in great torrents. The light crystals on the walls flare brightly and start spitting and arcing with electricity. On the ceiling, a 1 foot crystal sheet begins pulsing a soft blue. You're trapped and the room is filling with water! Shocking Crystals (initiative 10, once water reaches 6ft., once): On round 3(see 'Rising Water' dynamic element), the water reaches the oversized crystals around the room. Everyone touching the water must make a DC10 Constitution save at disadvantage or take 22 (4d10 lightning damage) and a half on a success. After that, the crystals are shorted by the body of water and are disabled. Flush (initiative 10, once water reaches 10ft for 2 rounds): Once the room has been full for 2 rounds(see 'Rising Water' dynamic element), water penetrates the thin crystal sheet on the ceiling. It fills the carving of powerful rune and activates it, triggering a ‘Reverse Gravity’ spell effect. At the same time, the western pool's stone slab shoots open. All of the water in the Entrance Hall is sucked down into the western pool. Any creature in Entrance Hall room must make a DC15 Strength check or be sucked into the western pool along with the water. Any creature sucked out into the pool this way ends up being pulled through the natural tunnel described in 1b. Coral Entrance, pushed towards the surface of the ocean and finally flung 50 ft into the air by a jet of water. A creature landing back in the ocean takes 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage from the ordeal, and ends up in Area 1. Statue's Base. After the rune triggers and evacuates the room, the 'Reverse Gravity' effect ends and the western pool's door slams closed. The room’s water level resets to 0ft. The copper pipes continue to pump water in the room as long as the trap is active. Dynamic Elements Rising Water: The rising water is the main component of this trap. To track progress, see the below table. Once the trap flushes the room, the trap resets to round 1 and cycles again. Rising Water Effects Round Effects 1 2 ft. water 2 4 ft. water 3 6 ft. water; see Shocking Crystals (DC1 0 Con, 2 2 [ 4 d1 0 ] ) 4 8 ft. water 5 1 0 ft. water, no air 6 1 0 ft. water, no air 7 0 ft. see Flush (DC1 5 Str, 2 2 [ 4 d1 0 ] ) Countermeasures Sealed Entrances Countermeasure: The slabs sealing the exits of this room have AC17, are magically reinforced to 30hp and are immune to nonmagical slashing, piercing, psychic and poison damage. Only three creatures can attempt to break a single door at a time. Catching the door as it was falling and holding it open by hand would be a herculean feat, requiring a DC30 Strength check immediately and an additional check at the same DC each round of holding the door up. Smashing the northern hallway slab allows the water to flow out of the room into Area 5. Living Caverns and effectively negates the “Shocking Crystals” and “Flush” Active Elements of the trap. If the trap is not de-activated the water will continue to pour out into the caverns. After 30 minutes the brass golem will come to seal the pipes and disable this aspect of the trap. (See Area 6. Boiler room for more details on the golem.) 10 Smashing the eastern elevator slab doesn’t slow down the “Water Rising” effect, but gives the players a way to escape back into area 3a. Water Elevator. At high tide, this smashed door will allow a massive amount of water to flow into the room and potentially the rest of the complex. After 30 minutes the brass golem will come to seal the pipes and disable this aspect of the trap. (See Area 6. Boiler room for more details on the golem.) Smashing the western pool slab gives the players a means of escape but otherwise does not stop the water level’s rising. Water Fill Countermeasure: The water is entering the room via 4 copper lines. Breaking the lines won't abate the water flow, but the players may have some method of sealing it. Applying adhesive or freezing the lines will prevent water from entering the room. If one of the pipes is blocked, delay the progression of ‘Rising Water’ by 1 round while the water re-routes. Afterwards, the flow from the other pipes increases in pressure. If all the pipes are frozen, the water stops progressing. Shocking Crystals Countermeasures: Smashing each crystal reduces the Constitution save DC by 3 and reduces damage by dealt by -1d10. Being out of the water when this element triggers also prevents the players from taking damage. Flush Countermeasures: Defacing the rune requires a DC15 arcana check to do correctly. Failing the check has no adverse effect, and can be tried again in subsequent rounds. Simply smashing the rune has a 75% chance of triggering the ‘Reverse Gravity’ effect immediately, but otherwise, will disable the rune. After the rune was triggered early, it will de- activate and remain inert. Emergency Activation Rune Countermeasures: The rune that emergency activates the trap can be tampered with a DC15 Arcana check. It temporarily disables an element of the trap for 1(1d2) rounds. Countermeasure Effects Roll (1 d6 ) Disabled Trap Component 1 -3 Copper pipes 4 -5 Shocking crystals 6 Flush Activation Switch Countermeasures: If a creature somehow got past the stone door while the trap was still active, there is a switch here that can activate and deactivate the Trial of Piesa trap. The switch appears like a gear shift on a car, with eight settings. Determining the combination to shut down an aspect of the trap requires a DC15 Investigation check. The first successful check turns off the crystals, the second turns off half the pipes (delaying progress for 1 round) and the third de- activates the remaining pipes and opens the sealed doors. The player could also read the mind of a kuo-toa or compels the kuo-toa to operate the lever. In that case it takes three rounds to completely shut down the trap but requires no rolls to do so. A player could pry the copper plate off the gearbox, making a DC12 Strength check. Once that’s done they could make a DC15 Thieves Tools to immediately de-activate the whole trap and open the doors. Trap Outcome If the players foil the trap, let them get into Area 5. Living Caverns without having alerted anyone. If the trap foils them, the kuo-toa will allow the trap to cycle for 5 minutes while they gather a force. (see Kuo-Toa Shock Troops below). They’ll then de-activate the trap and sweep the room, and surrounding waters to make sure the intruders are dealt with. Kuo-Toa Shock Troops 1 Kuo-Toa Archpriest , 4 Kuo-Toa, 1 Mind Flayer (5,200 xp) Shock Troop Treasure: 2 blue jasper worth 50 gp each, Slave Pen Key 5 . Living Caverns There are three separate cave areas here where the kuo-toa live. The first area is huts for sleeping, the second is a semi- dry area where the food stocks are kept, and the third are a completely submerged area where the kuo-toa tadpoles can learn to swim and grow into adults. All of these areas are covered in the thick mucus that the kuo-toa naturally excrete. Sometimes the substance is sticky, or slippery. All the water in this area is fouled and undrinkable. Various equipment can be found in each of the caves, including cogs, vibrating machinery, spinning screws and vibrating pumps. Breaking any of these equipment’s will trigger the ‘Copper devices’ event outlined in the dungeon section. 5 a. Central Cavern You enter a large, irregularly shaped cavern. The ceiling is covered in stalagmites. Five chest high huts dot the area, set amongst dripping pools and piles of refuse. The air here tastes salty. There are a group of fish-creatures here going about their business, speaking in their strange language. None have noticed you yet. Various pipes run along the walls and ceiling. There are two other tunnels leading out of this room that lead to other caverns. The leftmost tunnel leads to the area where they keep their food. The rightmost tunnel leads a large pool. 5 b. Left Cavern You enter a large, irregularly shaped cavern. Stalagmites descend from the ceiling, dripping. and stalagtites dot the floor. Between the rock spears are small pools of water.Some of the pools are teeming with dead fish, that float on the surface. Others have small piles of kelp and crustacean shells in them. The whole room stinks of fish and rot. There are a few groups of fish men here going about their business, speaking in their strange language. Most seem to be eating, crouched around these disgusting pools and grabbing whatever floats to the top. The righthand tunnel leads to an adjacent cavern. The lefthand tunnel winds on into darkness. 5 c. Right Cavern You enter a large, circular shaped cavern. It’ s dominated by a still, dark pool set in a stony dip. Water slowly drops from overhead stalagmites into it’ s dark surface. The pool must be at least twenty feet deep. Peering into the pool, you can see pale tadpole creatures in various stages of development. Some seem to be half-formed, or infantile. It's clear these are the fishmen young.There are stalactite’ s and the like dotting the outside of the pool. There is a passage on the leftside of the room, leading to another cavern. On the right side of the room, a tunnel winds on into darkness. If the kuo-toa are not on alert, at any given time there is approximately 12 (5d4) kuo-toa in each cavern, either asleep, eating, talking amongst themselves or playing fish-man games. Combat If combat starts in one of the caverns, the kuo-toa in that cave will fight to the death. The others will scurry off to form posses and protect key areas of the Caves. One will go to the boiler room to defend the eggs, one will go to the main cavern to defend the council. If there is a third group, it will patrol the caverns looking for interlopers. There is a 30% chance to encounter this patrolling group every 10 minutes while the players are in the Pearlescent Temple. Stealth If the players would like to sneak through these caverns be aware of the kuo-toa darkvision, passive perception and their Otherworldly Perception ability that lets them see through invisibility or etherealness, but not illusions. Treasure: 4 gems (peridot, opals, sapphires) worth 50 GP each is spread out amongst the refuse of the kuo-toa's possessions. 6 . Boiler Room Read the following: You descend downwards into a lower grotto. It’ s much warmer and more humid in this area lit by green light crystals. Hundreds of pipes emerge from the ceiling of this room before entering a great metallic vessel set off the floor on a metal gallery. The vessel is covered in a variety of switches, knobs and indicators. Cogs, screws, and spinning turbines of all kinds hum, clank and grind all around this room. The floor is covered in pools of hot water, formed by dripping liquid from the ceiling. You can see dozens of eggs laying at the bottom of each pool. The eggs are pale and a light purple colour. There must be hundreds of eggs in total. You gaze is drawn to the metal gallery as thunderous steps resound through the room. A looming figure comes into the crystal light, a 1 0 -foot tall humanoid made of bronze and covered in clockwork cogs. Its legs let out a small jet of steam each time it takes a step. Its eyes glow with a golden light as it fixes on you. There is one other tunnel leading out of the room on the opposite end, sloping upwards. Reinforcements The kuo-toa are familiar with the brass golem and know to leave him alone. If creatures came from the living caverns to here, some of the kuo-toa are positioned above the doorway and drop nets on the heroes, while the rest fling spears from around the room. After that, they’ll approach with a shield in hand and attempt to bite them to death. The brass golem will avoid the conflict, and only join in if attacked or someone damages the room’s equipment. Golem. A brass golem (stats of a iron golem) lives in this room, maintaining the equipment. He similar in size and design to an iron golem, except his blade-arm is a swiss-army knife of various construction tools like a welder, a rivet gun, hammer, and screw. He is non-hostile but will defend the equipment of this room or himself if attacked. He has no desire to kill others but will not allow anyone to touch the equipment in this room. He speaks the language chosen earlier in the High Shrine. If it’s a dead language, a DC20 Intelligence check could be made to get a basic understanding of what the golem is trying to communicate at any given time, but no specifics can be gleaned. What He Knows. The brass golem knows the information described in the Pearlescent Temple pre-amble. He is a creature built to serve the Great Ocean Goddess and maintains the equipment of the temple. The equipment and golem were made by a genius inventor named Kwalish, who was a disciple of the Great Ocean Goddess. The Kuo-toa came to the temple after the great earthquake, and have mostly left its equipment alone. The golem is unaffected by the curse but knows of its existence. Finally, it knows that there is a chamber none should enter. A terrible creature was imprisoned there, but it has escaped since the earthquake. He doesn't know what it is. Supplies. Located in this room are also a dwindling collection of copper plates, tubes, bolts, stone doors and plasters use to maintain the facility. The brass golem is running out of these supplies, however, as the long years have warranted frequent repairs of the temple. 1212 7 . Central Cavern The path before you widens into a large natural cavern. This room is filled with damp darkness, except for sickly green glowing crystals that illuminate two exits on the far wall of the room. If creatures have darkvision, bright enough illumination or they approach the centre of the room: Half a wooden galley looms in the darkness of the centre of the room, resting on its belly and the deck titled towards you. Above the wreck, a massive but delicate looking brass contraption is fixed to the ceiling. Various orbs on it rotate and spin around one another. Gears, pumps and screws operate around the room, filling the space with a mechanical hum. The air here tastes stale and salty. If the kuo-toa from the living caverns are here: Trilling and chirping fills the space as you spot 1 2 fishmen scattered near the galley, with at least three on its upper deck. One stands behind a small ballista on that deck. Loaded in the ballista is an irregular shaped bolt made from bone. If a kuo-toa is on the ballista, they make attacks at +3 and deals 14 (3d8) on hit. Light. Carrying lights into this area alerts any creatures present to outsiders. Galley. The council chamber is a half of a galley, set in the centre of the cave. There is a ten-foot opening on one end, and 3ft. secret underwater entrance on the other side. The deck of the galley is mostly intact and can be traversed. There is a swivelling ballista on the top level here that has been repaired by the kuo-toa. If the kuo-toa are defending this room, one creature is manning the ballista. The buzzing originates from the galley, the Nothic’s Weird Insight and the Illithid’s psionic blast create an odd psychic resonance in the area that has nothing to do with the machines. There are two more bolts available, and reloading the ballista takes a full round. Orrery. The orrery is a delicate copper contraption run by the machines of the facility. It’s a moving system of orbs that mimics the movement of astral bodies on the prime material plane. There are four arms, a dozen orbs and one surprisingly delicate looking rod that fixes the whole assembly to the ceiling. A DC15 Wisdom check allows an observer to realise the orrery shows the positions of all the moons and sun relative to the material plane. The orrery may also represent the motion of planes if it fits your setting. Reaching the Orrery. A creature could climb the rock walls to reach the orrery if they wanted. It would take a DC14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity(Acrobatics) to climb the 30ft of slippery but rough walls and jump to the orrery. Moving about the device requires a DC14 Dexterity(Acrobatics) check to make progress quickly, but otherwise, a creature could spend 3 minutes to carefully make their way to any point on the machine. Reinforcements If the kuo-toa from the caves are here along with the council members, this could be a very deadly fight. Give your players a chance to run away and come up with another plan or circumvent this area. The illithid will command their forces not to pursue, fearing a trap in the other chambers. He’ll play it cautiously and wait for the PC’s to return, setting his forces up as strategically as possible and having the council on-guard. Breaking Equipment Orrery Arms. Each round the arms of the orrery makes a quarter turn. Individual arms of the orrery have AC12, 8hp. Anything caught below a falling arm would need to make DC14 dexterity check. On a failure, they take 14 (3d8) damage from falling debris and half on a success. That area would now be difficult terrain as the metal remains make it difficult to easily move through. In this way, the players could keep dropping arms on the areas they choose. Bring it All Down. The central connector that suspends the whole contraption has AC13, 16hp. Anything underneath the entire contraption would need to make DC16 dexterity check. On a failure, they take 31 (7d8) damage. That area would now be difficult terrain as the metal remains make it difficult to easily move through. If the players wreck the orrery and drop it on the enemies here, the creatures inside and around the galley need to make saves as normal. The commoners inside will most likely all be crushed. Any surviving creature within the galley will get healed if possible before exiting the wreckage via underwater entrance. 7 a. Council Chamber ( in Central Cavern) The opening into the galley is on the west side. Three Ingpool residents are manacled to the wall while the Nothic’s extract their secrets with their Weird Insight ability. An kuo-toa and Illithid are overseeing the operation. The Illithid occasionally lets out a low-intensity psionic blast to keep the slave's minds fried and pliable. The mind flayers have hatched a plan to take control of the Aboleth and are executing it by condition these slaves before delivering them. It’s unlikely the heroes could negotiate in any way with the Illithid, and it’s impossible with the kuo-toa. Enemies: 1 Kuo-Toa Monitor, 1 Mind flayer ,3 Nothic (6,550xp) Combat Strategies. The Illithid will attempt to kill intruders. At half hp, or once most of its allies are dead, it will plane shift away. The Monitor and Nothics fight to the death. If things turn deadly, don’t wipe the party. The mind flayers are interested above all in intel and will want to know how much the outside world knows about their presence here. They have more than enough tools to disable and capture the PC’s. If anyone is captured, they’ll be stripped of gear and taken to the slave pens. Their gear will be taken to a the Godcrusher Shrine. Give them a chance to smuggle hidden equipment, plan an escape and take the fight back to their kuo-toa enslavers. 13 Treasure: Gold bird cage worth 250gp, Glass bracelet worth 250gp, 3 Potion of Water Breathing, Gloves of Swimming and Climbing, One Key for Slave Pens 8 . Coral Chambers You stand at a T intersection. Ahead the carved tunnel continues. To your right, a carved staircase descends into water. The staircase leads to a hallway that is fully submerged. There are six rooms in this hallway. Rooms 8a-d: Each of these rooms have door stuck ajar. Inside the room are smashed chairs, beds, dressers and floating scraps of clothing. Rooms 8e: The last room on the left has the door blown off, and it floats trapped against the ceiling. Investigating inside this room reveals pipes running along the walls have ruptured, and is the source of flooding in this area. Room 8f: This room has a ‘stone door’ and is sealed shut by barnacles and coral. Forcing this door open requires at DC15 Strength check. Read the following once its opened: Water pushes you in as it floods the otherwise dry chamber. The room appears to be some kind of workshop. Metal sheets, tools and the like are scattered about. Parchments covered in writing are swept off a table as the room begins to quickly fill with water. The parchments are written in common and are the writings of Kwalish the inventor. If a player gathers the paper up or protects it from the water they can discover that Kwalish was a disciple of the Great Ocean Goddess, and designed the machines that inhabit the temple. He has designs for the boiler, the brass golem, and the Apparatus of Kwalish here. (not enough to re-create these devices, but useful insight.) The water quickly ruins the old parchments and destroys the inks otherwise. 9 . Shore Chambers You stand at a T intersection. Ahead the carved tunnel continues. To your right, a carved staircase descends ten feet before continuing on. Descending the staircase reveals a hallway lined with six doors. Each has a wooden door that is stuck (see dungeon section for details.) The final door on the right side of the hallway is a stone door. Behind this door is another bedroom. It contains nothing of value, but would make an excellent place for a long rest. 1 0 . Stingroom You enter a small, 3 0 -foot room. Various colourful, underwater sea-growths cover the floors and walls. The wiggle and undulate in some invisible current. Glowing crystals light the area in a sickly green. Across the room, another tunnel leads on. This room is filled with poison urchins and the like. Anyone moving carelessly amongst the urchins will get stung and must make a DC12 Constitution save or become poisoned for 1 hour. If a creature moves carefully or destroys obstructions they can safely cross the room. A determine creature could make a DC14 Intelligence(Nature) check to harvest a single dose of injury poison. This poison lasts for 1 hour when applied, and targets injured make a DC12 Constitution check or become Poisoned. The kuo-toa occasionally harvest the poisons in this room but otherwise leave it alone. 1 1 . Slave pens This pitch black room is filled with low moaning, weeping or whispered conversation. Three cages made of coral and covered in spikes are situated in the room. The insides are packed with townsfolk, dirty and bleeding. Each cage has an iron door built into it. There is a hallway past the cages that continues further on. This is where 24 captives are held, waiting for brainwashing. If the players are looking for Marga Saltspoor, she is here. They’re kept in coral cages covered in sea anemones, urchins and the like. The locks are kept shut by keys held by each mind flayer. The cages can be smashed open or picked using a DC14 Thieves Tools or Strength check. The townsfolk are extremely grateful and will follow the players around unless told otherwise. They’ve seen the mind flayers and fish-men, and know people are being dragged off some god-forsaken reason. Probably to be eaten. 1 4 1 2 . Godcrusher Shrine This room is a bit complicated, so make sure to explain slowly and re-iterate as needed. You enter a vast underground cavern. The side of the room you entered on is a 2 0 -foot band of cave floor. After that, a large dark pool begins that occupies the rest of the chamber. It stretches out eighty feet until it reaches three colossal statues sticking out of the water. Each statue depicts a robed woman with a hand outstretched at waist height. The three statues are holding their hands together, forming a platform. A 1 0 ft wide stone walkway runs along the left side of the room, above the water. The walkway stretches the length of the room to the back wall. A thin bridge then stretches out over the water and connects the walkway to the statue’ s hands. Resting on the hands of the statues appears to be a bizarre copper barrel. From here you can see the barrel has an open hatch in its rear where a creature could crawl in. On the front of the device are two circular green light crystals. Along the right side of the room appears to be a semi- submerged walkway that extends fifty feet out into the water before reaching a staircase that descends into murky darkness. On the walkway appears to be a small pile of rusty swords, armour and fishing nets.[ The players gear are also here, if they were captured earlier.] Overhead, the ceiling appears to be made of a latticework of glass and copper. The 'skylight' looks out into the dark ocean, where only the occasional fish can be seen. There are few cracks in the skylight, where small streams of water fall to the floor. A low buzz reaches your ear over the sound of falling water, and your eyes are drawn to the groups of creatures scattered about this room. The creatures are dwarves and gnomes, completely covered in slime with dazed looks on their face. Each has their mouth open, emitting a droning noise. The water of the pool before you displaces as something huge stirs beneath the surface. A blue tentacle briefly emerges before slipping out of sight. The Godcrusher shrine was formerly a worship room to the Great Ocean Goddess. The altar and its treasure hoard have been submerged in 30 feet deep water. The aboleth will contact anyone it spots in this room. Play it as a disdainful god. These mortals are lice, and they should quail and worship. It also loves flattery. If it spots anyone gets within reach of its tentacles (like crossing the bridge or going for the gear) it will attack and try to enslave the creatures. Skylight could be magically phased in and out of the Ethereal plane to flood the room. The command word is lost to time, thought an Identify spell cast on it may reveal the word. The magic of the skylight is failing and the ceiling is continually leaking. Pumping equipment at the bottom of the pool is constantly running to prevent the flooding of the caverns. Statue’s hands. While a creature stands on the platform formed by the statues it can see a ring of pearlescent silver set into the statue’s hands. This ring is covered in powerful arcane runes and glows faintly. Any creature that inspects the circle with a DC15 Intelligence (Arcana) check determines that this is a permanent magic portal to the elemental plane of water. The command word to activate the ring is lost to time, but may be able to be determined through an appropriate means. (the brass golem, research, an arcana check, identify spell. This is just a nice sting for future underwater adventures). Copper Machine. This device is a Apparatus of Kwalish. Inside are ten levers that operate the device as described in the DMG pg.191. Instructions for operating the device are etched inside the interior of the device's ceiling in common. It’s important to note that two creatures can fit inside, and each can operate two levers a turn. Reaching the Apparatus might be challenging, but it has a large hp pool and can be helpful in a fight against the Godcrusher. Godcrusher. (stats as Aboleth) is an ancient and clever creature that hid in the temple many years ago and awoke with the earthquake. It has formed a psychic connection to the kuo-toa in the temple and tolerates the mind flayers until it can find a way to dominate or destroy them. It assumes but doesn’t know the mind flayers plan to likewise destroy it. The mind flayers all avoid this room as they fear the psychic power of the Godcrusher. The Godcrushers only goals are to gather worshipers and increase its own power. The more worshipers it possesses, the stronger it becomes. Its ultimate goal is to enslave all sentient creatures and create an underwater empire. Slaves. The slaves of this room are in a trance and are worshipping the Godcrusher. They act as a swarm and are considered to have AC10 and 10hp. A player can interrupt the groups worship with a DC15 Persuasion or Intimidation to break them out of the trance. They can also be knocked out, put to sleep, have a Restoration spell cast on them or whatever other appropriate action PC’s try. Slaves in Combat. If a group’s worship is disrupted, decrease the Aboleth’s maximum hp by 30. During the fight, the Aboleth can call a worshipping group as a free action to enter the pool on his turn. On subsequent turns, he can use his Psychic Drain ability to restore lost health. This reduces his max hp as described but restores lost hp by the amount listed in the Psychic Drain. As such he shouldn’t use this ability unless he’s 50hp below his maximum. Summary of features in this fight: Apparatus of Kwalish resides on the platform above the water and would be useful in the fight. (details on pg.191 of the DMG) Worshippers: there are 4 groups with AC10, 10hp and no bonuses to saving throws. Disrupting their worship with DC 15 checks or killing/knocking them out will reduce Godcrusher’s maximum hp by 30. The aboleth has very good passive perception, so only exceptionally stealthy creatures can avoid it’s notice. The aboleth might contact creatures it spots, only if to determine that creature’s motivation and turn the creature into a thrall or tempt it with promises. The players might be able to distract the Aboleth while someone sneaks up to the Apparatus. If anyone gets within reach, the aboleth will try and pull them into its pool and enslave them. When combat starts, two Chuul lurking at the bottom of the pool emerge along the underwater staircase. These creatures will target those in the very back, and drag them into the Godcrusher's pool. Creatures Present: 1 Godcrusher (stats as an Aboleth, max hp: 216), 2 Chuul, 4 groups of slaves (8,800xp) Treasure: This treasure is located at the bottom of the Aboleth's pool in a mound. 16,500 gp, 30 lbs. unstamped Devil's Steel trade bars (Panzir's shipment, illegal to sell locally, gear made from it counts as magic and evil aligned.), 1 disguise kit (25 gp), 1 set of bagpipes (30 gp), 1 bottle(s) of fine wine (10 gp), 3 bottle(s) of common wine (0.6 gp), 1 set of navigator's tools (25 gp), 6 eye agate worth 10 gp each, 6 yellow sapphire worth 1000 gp each, Potion of stone giant strength, Potion of mind reading, Quaal's Feather Token(Swan Token), Potion of superior healing Ending With the temple cleared, the captured villagers are safe. It's trivial to go back and get enough boats to save everyone, or the players can use their new Quaal's Feather Token to ferry the townsfolk home. The mayor or Manner will pay 5,000gp for the people's safe return. Panzir will pay 5,000gp if the players bring back his bars. Loose Ends There are several loose ends in this adventure. The Elder Brain is still in the Underdark, plotting the enslavement of all sentient creatures. Maybe the plans for an Apparatus of Kwalish is nearby and the heroes could use it to get to the Underdark. This temple has a portal to the elemental plane of water. This might be useful if players want to adventure to that plane. The orrery if intact might be of interest to local wizards. Maybe they make some dread discovery about the world based on the movement of the heavens. Appendix A: Timeline of Events 1. Illithid arrive thousands of years ago, fleeing annihilation at the hands of their former slaves. They live in Underdark, gathering what minions they can. 2. Present day, an earthquake opens a crack into the Underdark. After dealing with the massive flooding, the Illithid’s send patrols to see what the source is. They discover a way to the surface. 3. The Elder Brain, the leader of the illithid, sees an opportunity to tap into the surfaces massive food and slave resources. It sends an expedition force of loyal Illithid commanders and the minions best suited for the purpose: a race of mutated fish-creatures named the kuo-toa. 4. The expedition finds the water entrance to the Pearlescent Temple and the kuo-toa take up residence. The Illithid have no care for gods and don’t fear divine wrath, and the archpriests are invigorated when they discover their new idol: an ancient Aboleth sleeping dormant in the temple 5. The aboleth wakes and takes on the kuo-toa as its willing slaves. The Illithid are forced to make an alliance with Godcrusher lest it turn all the kuo-toa against them. A new opportunity presents itself in the meantime: the aboleth demands more worshipers. 6. (Initial Hook) Kuo-toa’s begin kidnapping local fishermen or people along the shoreline who are alone. Their goal is to return these people to the temple and use them for menial labour, food source and worshippers of their new god. 7. The townsfolk decide the trolls that live in town are to blame for the disappearances. The townsfolk burn one troll at the stake and chase the rest out into the wild. 8. Godcrusher grows impatient and pushes his plans forward. Some captives, thoroughly brainwashed and controlled, are sent back to Ingpool to poison the populace. The goal is to soften the town and commit a mass abduction. 9. The kuo-toa mount an attack on the weakened town and capture or kill most of the town. 10. The Godcrusher is now completely in control. The illithid flee back to the Underdark, fearing destruction or domination. 16 Legal Stuff D 1. More people migrate to the village over time, but disappearances continue. A low fog settles over the town, and most it falls into disrepair as the populace barely maintains their standard of living. 2. Things can develop from there as you wish – maybe the kuo-toa swell to larger enough numbers to assault the aquatic races. Appendix B: Authors Note Thanks for reading.
