{"path":"Whale campaign/A Structure/Third Party/Big Encounters 2 - 6 Hours/2248652-Volcano_Island.pdf","text":"12 Introduction of Series I’m Justin Blasdel, and I thank you for reading my works. This particular series is all about mini-campaigns for Dungeons & Dragons 5 th Edition. Each mini-campaign is numbered, and that number is meant to be the level of character it is designed for. “1 st of 20”is meant for Level 1 Characters. It goes all the way to 20, so your DM can continue the series as if it is one long campaign. I will admit that each mini-campaign was not designed to give enough XP to level the characters up after completion. The focus was to make complete missions. So, if you do run through all 20, it will have to be based on the milestone system. Also, each one has homebrewed NPCs and items, as well as references to official NPCs from official D&D books. There is a loose storyline for the series. They are based on the Forgotten Realms universe, and they start at the Flooded Forest in the South and end in the Northern end of the Border Forest. The descriptions of each location will be based on a location in the Forgotten Realms, but feel free to rewrite them as necessary. These mini-campaigns are meant to be a few things. One, you can use them to help level up your Players’ Characters. Two, they provide a nice detour from a long-lasting campaign. Three, they offer a chance to still play a game when one or more Players are absent. Four, they can be a stand-alone series for an exciting and diverse campaign. When I playtested the series with my friends at Game Portal in Mountain Home, Arkansas, I had a plethora of different Players. Sometimes I’d only have two, and once I even had to accommodate eight. One week I’d all physically built characters, and the next I’d have all magic wielders. I had one or two character deaths, but I never TPK’d the party. This series is meant to be fun. Dangerous, but not certainly lethal in the right circumstances. Feel free to change them up to your preferences and the group’s needs. D&D is meant to be played. As long as everyone has fun, that’s the right way to play. If you have any questions for me, or spot a few errors, feel free to contact me. And of course, please rate the mini-campaigns. I need all the publicity I can get.

All of Cedarspoke is in a hurry, and booking passages becomes more and more difficult. At the docks, the party manages to find a vendor who sells them passage upon a large cargo ship headed eventually towards Westgate. The ship is named Queen Paisley, and it’s captained by the half-elf Yenfor. There are a number of other passengers, too. Vozla and Rei Linn, a young married couple off to make their fortune in the fishing business in Carrone. Saker Berryblood, a dwarven mercenary off towards Westgate in search of work. Rosalie Belmia, a halfling herbalist in search of new plants to study. Moortar, a half-orc seamstress looking for a place to retire. The Queen Pasley departs from the docks, and the party is on their way towards Carrone. Along the way, the passengers seem to be stricken by some form of madness. Vozla and Rei claim the other is unfaithful and duel with swords. Saker Berryblood claims that Captain Yenfor cannot steer a ship and tries to take over. Rosaline Belmia opens up many bags of grain and pours them overboard, claiming that the sea is starving. These events happen one per day, until the last passenger is Moortar. After questioning, she is revealed to be a Sea Hag and either escapes or is killed by the party. Soon after, the ship is attacked by an Eel Hydra and sustains heavy damage. The only island nearby is the home of the evil keipers, the Volcano Island. By a streak of luck, the sinking ship is able to avoid the rocks and set anchor. The crew can repair the ship, but Captain Yenfor knows that the Keiper will soon attack. The party must seek out the nearby camp and kill all of the Keiper as a warning to all the island to leave the Queen Paisley alone. After repairs are made, the ship is allowed to go along it’s way, and the party continues their adventures. Player’s Introduction The chatter of busied commerce is constant throughout the air. Some voices are angryand shouting at the unfair prices of dried fish. Others are giddyat the notion of travelling to foreign, exotic lands. Afew huddled groups of sailors are exchanging dirtystories all involving mishaps and lessons to be learned. What these conversations share is asense of urgency. It is time to sail. 4 Cedarspoke is acityof trade, as it is located on the Seaof Fallen Stars. The warm winds of the East have made their seasonal cycle, and now the air blows fiercelytowards the West. The merchants have amassed their wares, spices, and tools, and now theyprepare for their passage towards larger cities, such as Starmantle and Westgate. Captains are seen on the docks of Sunstone Port, booking passage for those rich enough for acomfortable trip. Theyare also offering paying jobs for adventurers and mercenaries alike. The waves of the Seaof Fallen Stars brings manydangers, and it is awise Captain who brings along those willing to fight. This is where the players find themselves. In order to book passage upon the ships, they either have to pay passage or be hired as guardians. At any other time of the year, there would be an office where one could officially book passage. During this time of the year, over a hundred ships are being supplied, loaded, and boarded. The chaos makes doing anything official almost impossible. The captains of each ship stand proudly at the walkways to their ships. They try to gain the attention of wealthy passengers, and they offer amazing sights to behold and a pleasant journey to be had. This is where the party will be introduced to Captain Yenfor. Captain Yenfor Gidalve (aswashbuckler) is arather dashing and calm half-elf who fancies himself as agreat traveller of the sea. His walk is always casual, but his piercing eyes reveal his sharp mind. When he speaks, his honeyed words upon his low voice brings smiles to young females, but he is not one to flirt with just anyone. When it is necessaryto exercise his authority, he commands like atrusted leader and friend. Captain Yenfor eyes the adventurers, and he addresses them directly. His voice can be heard perfectly through all the chaos. He admits that he has not seen a better group of adventurers on Sunstone Port yet, and he is in desperate need of them. Usually he wouldn’t boost their egos, but he truly does need to set sail soon. He was about to hire some pathetic band of ruffians, but he’d rather have a capable crew. (This is when the Players can introduce their characters in game, especially if there are new Players to an already formed group. They can be other adventurers who happen to pass by.) He is willing to offer 100GP for every person who travels upon his ship: The Paisley. The job would be until they reach the ports of Westgate, and the party would be responsible for keeping the ship, it’s contents, and it’s crew safe from all harm. Water and food will be given in addition to the pay, and the party will have their own room to sleep upon cots and the floor. If the party chooses to do so, they can try to haggle for a higher pay. They can roll Persuasion check at DC 15, or they can roll Intimidation at DC 20. For each number rolled equal to and above the DC, the party gets +10for each member. (Example: A 17 would mean 120GP.) After everything is settled, the party can board The Paisley. It is a sailing ship, and it is mostly designed to transport goods in it’s lower decks. It has a crew of 30, could potentially house up to 20 passengers (but it is using the room for more storage), and is equipped with a ballistafor protection. The crew is as follows: 5 Captain: Yenfor Gidalve, ahalf-elf male (swashbuckler) First Mate: ReirrokaraForgemaul, amountain dwarf female (swashbuckler) Bosun: BerthaNavarra, ahuman female (swashbuckler) Quartermaster: EllaVergalla, ahuman female (swashbuckler) Surgeon: Jolene Finch, ahuman female (priest) Cook: HenrySallent, ahuman male (guard) *Refer to The Paisley for map information on the ship. The crew will not be directly involved with the storyline, but they are listed for flavor. All other ship members are commoners. If the party inquires as to what exactly the ship is carrying, they can either ask the crew or inspect the crates. Primarily, the crates hold fur pelts from beasts found all over the Gulthmere Forest and the Orsraun Mountains. While collectively the pelts would collect much gold, individually the pelts are not worth that much. They also carry blocks of wood cut from centuries old trees, dried beef, and bags of spices. There are also a locked door in the lower compartment (the Hold). It will take Proficiency in Thieves Tools at a DC of 20to unlock the door. If the crew is asked about the door, they will explain that it houses rare jewels mined from the Osraun Mountains. Anyone caught in there will be thrown overboard in the middle of the Sea. If the party breaks in, they will find many chests. Most are without locks, and they simply carry rarer raw minerals that don’t amount to much. There is a chest that is magically locked. The DC to pick the lock is 25, unless the party uses dispel magic, which then the DC becomes 15. If opened, it will reveal a collection of gems worth 5,000GP. If the party does steal any amount of the gems, Captain Yenfor(or First Mate Reirrokaraor Bosun Bertha, if the others are dead) will know the following night. Short of some sort of miracle, Captain Yenfor will command his crew to attack the players and throw them overboard. The ship will not sail properly with a trained crew of less than 3. After the cargo is loaded and the party arrives, the paying passengers arrive. Captain Yenfor is exceptionally pleasant towards theses guests, and he gives them a tour of his ship as they arrive. The passengers are as follows: Moortar is an elderlyhalf-orc seamstress (seahag in disguise). Although her aged form is still quite muscular and intimidating, she has averywelcoming smile and caring demeanor. She loves for people to share their life stories with her, and she will knit them clothes while theydo so. She is veryproud, and does not wish to be physicallyaided in anyway. Rei Linn is ayoung human merchant (commoner). He is the second youngest son of asuccessful fishing merchant, and he plans to manage one of the fisheries located on Carrone. He is verypositive bout his future, and he is completelyin love with his new bride. Rosalie Belmiais amiddle-aged halfling botanist (commoner). She was not fortunate enough to be born with amagical skill, but she does her best to collect herbs and discover new remedies. She hopes that in Westgate she can purchase informative books to aid her quest, bywhich she is completelyconsumed. 6 Saker Berryblood is an aging dwarven mercenary(veteran). He paid for a comfortable trip rather than be one of the deckhands, because he takes pleasure in watching the sea. He left his home, because he did not want to die an old man’s death. He dreams of being slain byamightyfoe in the near future. VozlaLinn is ayoung human performer (commoner). She was born of peasantry, but her beautiful singing voice mad her into alocal favorite at the taverns. Rei fell in love with her at first sight and promised her alife of luxuryand happiness. She too fell deeplyin love, and she is eagerlyanticipating their new lives together. As the evening nears, Captain Yenfor commands the crew to prepare to leave Sunstone Port, even though the other ships are waiting until morning. He swears to know the Fallen Star Sea so well that he can navigate around them in darkness. Besides, he explains, it will mean he will not have to steer around the poorly sighted human captains. After the sails have been dropped and The Paisley is well on her way, Captain Yenfor addresses the crew and passengers. He thanks them all for joining him on yet another voyage across the Sea of Fallen Stars. He reveals that Cook Sallent has prepared a very large feast, and that everyone will eat upon the Main Deck as to get to know each other better. The crew sits apart from the passengers and the party. This is the perfect time for the party to learn more information about the passengers. NOTE: Moortarwill do everything in her ability to not be touched. She will disguise it as being too proud to be helped. If someone tries to touch her, she will try to dodge with a contested Athletics roll. If she is touched, she will feel wet, slimy, and thinner than her appearance would reveal. If inspected, the player will have to roll an Investigation check at DC 16to discern that Moortar is in disguise. When the meal is done, the party and passengers retire to their quarters. The passengers will have individual rooms in the Hold, and the players will share a room in the Lower Deck. Day 1 The skies are clear, and the warm wind is blowing strongly against the sails. Captain Yenfor believes that the trip will be completed in no less than two weeks, and Starmatle in just a week. Everything is quite normal until Rei and Vozlaget into a horrible fight. Rei claims that Vozla has been unfaithful to him and has slept with hundreds more than she revealed. Vozla believes Rei is just using her for her body, and that he will choose another bride once they reach Westgate. The fight continues all day long, until the two become so infuriated that they decide to fight. Without warning, the two pull swords on one another and try to kill each other. The party may choose to stop the two, but Rei and Vozla with then attack them instead. After they are bound, they still want to attack each other. Captain Yenfor will order them to be locked in separate rooms. 7 For each player that decides to inspect the couple, they may roll a Perception check at DC 20. If they succeed, they see that the couple are wearing newly knitted scarves. Once the scarves are removed, the couple immediately are calm and have no idea why they were angry at each other. If Moortaris questioned, she reveals that she did talk to the couple, and that they sounded like they were about to emotionally explode. The party can decide to make a contested Insight check against Moortar. If they try to touch Moortar, they will have to make the same roll as before to see through her disguise. She will have no problem being locked into her quarters. If the party attacks her, she will reveal herself to be a seahag. If they kill her, her dying words will be a curse upon the ship, as she explains that her “pet”will avenge her. Note: If the party does not combat Moortar, the following days happen as they are stated. For a full description of my Homebrew creation of the eel hydra(plesiosaurus), please go to the end of this document. Day 2 SakerBerryblood becomes very distressed by the changing of the winds and the sea waves. He becomes increasingly convinced that the weather has made an unprecedented change, and that there will be a great storm soon. The skies are clear, and a Nature check at DC 10reveals that the skies will remain sunny and clear. Saker cannot be convinced of this, and he grows more irritable as the day goes on. He starts to shout out at Captain Yenforand demands a change in course. Captain Yenfor will do no such thing and orders Saker to go to his quarters. Saker is infuriated that his advice is ignored, and he sprints to the wheel of the ship. His intent is to change course towards the nearest island to wait out the storm. Captain Yenfor is more than a match for Saker. For each player who decides to inspect Saker, they make an Investigation check at DC 15. If they succeed, they notice that Saker is wearing newly knitted socks. If the party decides to question Moortar, the same events happen as listed in Day 1. Saker is ordered to be locked in his room for the duration of the visit. If his socks are taken off, he will no longer be angry and have no idea why he acted so foolishly. Day 3 Rosalie Belmiais concerned that the sea water has soaked the food supply. She inspects the bags of grain meant for the crew’s food supplies, and she is convinced that it is growing bold. A Nature check at DC 10reveals that the grain is perfectly dry and healthy, but Rosalie will hear none of that. Eventually, she brings the bags of grain up to the Main Deck, one by one. After she brings up 10 bags, she begins to tear them open and pour them over deck. She is raving about the many dangers of contaminated food, and she swears she’s protecting the entire crew. 8 Whoever is on the Main Deck will attempt to stop her, as that is the crew’s main source of food. After she is bound, any Player that wants to inspect her may do so and make an Investigation check at DC 10. Success reveals that she is wearing a newly knitted sweater. If Moortaris questioned, the same events happen as listed in Day 1. Rosalie is also ordered to be locked in her cabin, and removal of her shirt will remove the spell that has been cast on Rosalie as well. Day 4 If Moortarhas not been found as the culprit of the recent madness, she will wait until nightfall to sneak into Captain Yenfor’squarters to attack him. Those on the deck will have to make a Perception check at DC 15to see her enter the captains quarters unhindered. After a bit of shouting, there is a horrific screaming. Captain Yenfor runs out of the room completely terrified. Behind him is Moortarrevealed to be a Sea Hag. Behind her is the corpse of Surgeon Jolene, frozen in fear. It seems she intended on killing Captain Yenfor, but she did not expect Jolene to be sharing his bed. Moortar will fight anyone who tries to prevent her from escaping overboard. Whether or not she escapes, she still warns of her pet’s imminent attack. Day 5 Early morning. If the party is on watch, they may all make a Perception check at DC 20. If they do so, they can see a shadowy entity coming near the ship within the water. It is about 50ft away from the boat, which might allow an attack. If not, everyone on the ship hears the multiple loud “thuds”against the hull of the ship. This will go on for 3 full turns, and on the end of that turn, the hull is slightly breached. It is a small leak, but it is one that will take a long time to repair. It is at this time that the Eel HydraPlesiosauruswill change tactics and begin attacking the crew. If Moortarmanaged to escape, she will call it away to safety before it is killed. If not, the Eel Hydra Plesiosaurus will attack until it dies. After battle, Bosun Berthawill assess the damage to the ship. She can repair it, but she’ll need more fresh tree sap than what there is on board. QuartermasterElla knows of only one island nearby; Volcano Island. It is known to be home an unusual race of pygme Ogres known as keipers, who are small-time pirates of the nearby sea. Captain Yenfor knows about the keipers, and he has a plan to deal with them. Volcano Island looks like the slightlysubmerged skull of ademon that lost its horn. Where the horn should be, the red light of lavacan be seen glowing against the volcano’s peak. There are no other mountains upon the island, and onlyat it’s base do the trees begin to grow. Everything about this island is unwelcoming, and death is certain for all those but the most cruel and hardy. As the crew and party arrives at the shore of Volcano Island, he explains that there is only one story where the keipers left a whole ship of travelers alone. In the story, the ship’s crew narrowly defended themselves against a vicious attack by the keipers. The captain was enraged and followed the surviving keipers to their huts. 9 Once there, he killed the entire clan, cut off their heads, and stuck them on spikes all around the beach. The next day, the ship’s crew were left alone to finish their repairs. Captain Yenfor believes that if the party does the same to a nearby clan of keipers, then they’ll be left alone too. The party must search the island for such a clan and annihilate it. *For a full description of my Homebrew creation of the keipers, please go to the end of this document. The party will need to make a Nature check at DC 10in order to be able to navigate the island. Once they do so and get their bearings, they can make an Investigation check DC 10to find a nearby Keiper village. If they fail these rolls, they can roll again, but five more keipers appear in the village for each failure(to be disbursed at DM approval). *Please refer to the Keiper village map. Whichever way the party wishes to attack, they must kill every keiper. Afterwards, they must cut off some of their heads and bring it back to be displayed on pikes around the ship. Once this is done, the ship is left alone from attacks during the night. If the nearby keiper clan is not killed, then double the amount of the remainders come to attack at night. Day 6 If the party and crew manage to survive by this time, Bosun Bertha finishes the repairs. The ship leaves Volcano Island. Quartermaster Ella determines that due to their change of course, they will most likely have to skip visiting Starmantle and instead head directly for Carrone. Going back to Starmantle would cost more than it’s worth, since they would be sailing against the winds. Captain Yenfor agrees, and the ship’s course is changed accordingly. THE END 1 0 Appendix A: NPCs Keiper (Pygmy Ogre Medium Giant, Chaotic Evil Armor Class: 11 hide armor Hit Points: 20 (4d8 +2) Speed: 30ft, swim 20ft STR: 16 (+3) DEX: 11 (+0) CON: 14 (+2) INT: 8 (-1) WIS: 7 (-2) CHA: 7 (-2) Skills: Intimidate +2, Survival +2 Condition Poisoned Senses: Passive Perception 8 Languages: Common, Giant Challenge: 1/2 (100XP) Proficiency Bonus: +2 ACTIONS Shortsword.

If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it must succeed on a Strength contest against the keiper or be pulled up to 20 feet toward the keiper. DESCRIPTION Small impersonations of their parent race, the Keipers are seafaring pirates with a battle lust matched by any warrior of the sea. Though they look exactly like Ogres, they do not share the larger size. They are the height of a normal human, but the Keipers definitely don’t act like they are aware of this. To them, they are still hulking beasts that all other should fear. They sail the seas looking for lost or under defended merchant ships, and they brutally kill every last innocent they can find. Though not great in height, their name spreads just as much fear. Impatient Fools. Ages ago, an evil sorcerer by the name of Eutropio Salas “The Greedy”had learned of an ancient treasure hidden on a volcanic island. Without a map, the island’s rocky shores would mean certain death to anyone foolish to approach it. Luckily for Eutropio Salas, he had acquired such a map. Fearing 1 1 that any normal mercenary would sell information about his destination, he hired a crew of Ogres barely intelligent enough to row their own boat. The ride would be without pleasantries, but Eutropio Salas would have his piece of mind. He arrived upon the island, and soon after he discovered an ancient temple. He went inside and collected a tingy golden statue capable of many wonders. When he returned to the surface, he witness a great storm reach the island and dash his boat against the rocks. When the storm cleared, he had no way of sailing away. The ogres, even as stupid as they were, realized that they were stuck on the island forever. In a fit of rage, they bashed Eutropio Salas “The Greedy”into a bloody pulp. Survival of the Smallest. Without a means of escape, the Ogres had to survive on the island the best they could. Their large appetites left very little on the island to sustain them, and so their greatest enemy became starvation. Many creatures on the island were incredibly poisonous, and a few Ogres died from eating too many brightly colored frogs. Generation after generation this continued, and those ogres who were smaller kept surviving. As time went on, the ogres began to dwindle in size until they evolved into the new race called the Keiper. Smaller skills, bigger brains. The keiper are not as strong as their ancestors, but they are smarter. A budding intelligence helped them build new boats, and so they were able to sail the seas and gather more food. They don’t wish to leave their new home. Instead, they use their skills to raid what was previously a safe sea. With furious ogre’s blood still in their veins, they vowed to feast upon sea beast and man alike, never to go hungry again. 1 2 Eel Hydra Plesiosaurus Large Monstrosity, Unaligned Armor Class: 13 Natural Armor Hit Points: 95 (13d10 + 24) Speed: 20ft, swim 40ft STR: 18 (+4) DEX: 15 (+2) CON: 16 (+3) INT: 2 (-4) WIS: 12 (+1) CHA: 5 (-3) Skills: Perception +6, Stealth +4 Senses: Darkvision 60ft, Passive Perception 13 Languages: -- Challenge: 6 (2,300XP) Proficiency Bonus: +3 Hold Breath. The eel hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour. Multiple Heads. The eel hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the eel hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious. Whenever the eel hydra takes 15 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the eel hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The eel hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way. Reactive Heads. For each head the eel hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks. Wakeful. While the eel hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake. ACTIONS Multiattack. The eel hydra makes as many bite attacks as it has heads. Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage. DESCRIPTION 1 3 Although this Monstrosity has the definitive hydra quality of multiple heads, it is in essence still a plesiosaurus. It hails from an amphibious reptilian background, and has long, flexible necks with which it can twist around to deliver a powerful bite. However, magic has warped its form, and now it swims the seas in search of food to satisfy its extra heads. Unlike the plesiosaurus, this creature actively seeks out humanoids for dinner. Those who sail the seas know that when the eel hydra is spotted, there is no other option than to prepare for an attack. It will retreat if it senses it is outmatched, but it will not stop hunting within its territory. Some sailor songs depict these beasts as ancient beings that sprung up from the ocean when an ancient dragon's blood hit the waters. These songs also swear that the creatures hoard great treasures below the waters, but rare are the few willing and able to investigate this tall tale. 1 4 Appendix B: Maps The Paisley 1 5 The Paisley (closer Floor Plans) 1 6 Keiper Village Keiper Village (with keiper locations)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
