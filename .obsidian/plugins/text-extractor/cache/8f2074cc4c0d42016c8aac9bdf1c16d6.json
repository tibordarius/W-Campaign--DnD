When this happens, it often helps to have an idea of the environment they will be inhabiting for a while. The Dungeon Master’s Guide includes some basic information regarding this, but the majority of the work is left up to the Dungeon Master themselves. To try and alleviate the workload, this document includes plans of the upper- and gun-decks and the combat stats of an example frigate: The Boundless. This is intended to be utilised with the Expanded Sailing document, also available on the Dungeon Master’s Guild, though it includes enough information to function entirely separately. THE BOUNDLESS Colossal ship Armour Class 15 Hit Points 300 Damage Threshold 15 Speed 16 mph Min. Crew 20 Standard Crew 150 Max. Passengers 300 Max. Cargo 300 Room Points 4 Armed. The Boundless is a heavily armed warship and carries an armament of 26 18-pounder cannons and 12 12-pounder cannons. Armoury. Swords, spears, bows, every weapon imaginable lines the walls of this room. Mannequins clad in a variety of armours and racks filled with ammunition ensure that there is enough equipment for anyone who could possibly wish for some. Room points: 1 Benefit: When under attack, any hireling that is not a spellcaster or soldier may visit the armoury and there-after count as a guard (Monster Manual, page 347). Hirelings equipped in this way may also be used offensively rather than just in defence. Captain’s Quarters. A neat, ordered room containing a simple bed and writing desk belies the fact that it belongs to one of the most important people on the ship. Room points: 1 Benefit: If a character spends a long rest in this room, they gain a +2 to all ability checks made to command the crew for 24 hours. In addition, any hireling actively attempting to protect the life of a character that has spent a long rest in this room in the last 24 hours adds 1d4 to all of their attack rolls to hit. Crewed. In order to function effectively, The Boundless must have a crew no smaller than the minimum crew size. With a crew this size it can sail easily, but will struggle to engage in combat. To successfully sail and use this ship in combat, a minimum of the standard crew size is required. ACTIONS Broadside. Ranged Weapon Attack: Assume between 1/4 and all cannons on one side of the ship hit their target, one target. Hit: 561 (13 x 33 (6d10) 6 x 22 (4d10)) bludgeoning damage Drop Anchor. The Boundless drops anchor. Furl/Unfurl Sails. The ship’s crew adjust the sails to catch more or less wind. Ram. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (5d8) bludgeoning damage. Single 18-pounder Cannon. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 1,000/6,000 ft., one target. Hit: 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage Swivel Gun. Ranged Weapon Attack: + dexterity modifier + proficiency bonus to hit, range 250/500 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage The Boundless is a classic example of a well-armed war ship. Capable of carrying up to 40 18-pounder long guns, frigates similar to this ship are a relatively common sight on the high seas. This particular frigate is outfitted with a large amount of guns for its size and is intended to see a significant amount of action. Its 38 guns are complemented by a variety of upgrades to enhance its fighting capability and the comfort of its crew. The upgrades and stats of this ship are provided below. If you wish to alter the specifics of The Boundless, alternative options are provided in the Enhanced Sailing supplement on the Dungeon Master’s Guild. CREW No matter how fantastic a ship is, it is the crew that really matters. A frigate such as the boundless needs at least 20 crew members to sail, but this is the bare minimum. Below are a few key NPC members of the crew that all ships are likely to have. THE CAPTAIN Usually appointed by the owner of the ship, who may be the same person, the captain is in charge. For all intents and purposes, the captain’s word is law on board their ship. LIEUTENANT Lieutenants help to ensure that the captain’s orders are carried out. A ship such as the boundless would likely only have one or two lieutenants, while a larger ship could have as many as five or six. BOATSWAIN/ BOSUN The boatswain is in charge of the deck crew. This involves overseeing the majority of a ship’s crew, planning, scheduling, and distributing work amongst them. In addition, they regularly inspect the ship for maintenance. SHIP’S COOK Without a cook, a ship’s crew has nothing to eat. While magic makes it possible to produce nourishing if bland food, decent meals are essential to keep up morale and ensure a decent, active crew. QUARTERMASTER The quartermaster is often the helmsman aboard the ship. In some instances, they are also responsible for organising supplies. On pirate vessels, the quartermaster has a much more important role, often being elected the same as a captain. They are often granted the ability to veto the captain’s decisions and are responsible for disciplining the crew. SHIP’S SORCERER Any ship worth its salt will have its own magic user. Mages aboard smaller merchant vessels may only be able to put out fires and protect crew members from wood chips, while more affluent merchants and larger warships will have mages capable of controlling the weather and protecting the entire ship from incoming fire. CLERIC Many ships will have a pious person aboard for any of a variety of reasons. Some may simply have a superstitious captain that wishes for divine favour, while others will be more pragmatic and employ a cleric to help tend to their wounded crew members.
