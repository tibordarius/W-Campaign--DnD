As a result, there are a few options for play: Each adventure can be used in a standalone way. Any time the adventurers are at sea, one of these adventures can be inserted into the set- ting being used. Alternatively, these episodes can be strung together into a larger, ongoing campaign. They have been written with this idea in mind, and the ongoing threat from the Far Realms creates the basic through-line to the larger campaign. Well-meaning DMs should also prepare their players: Because many of these adventures have a personal thrust to them (the betrayal of good friends, the splitting of one’s own personality, etc.), Dungeon Masters and players should communicate about how much each is com- fortable with. If, for example a player doesn’t want to temporarily lose the agency of their character, or if your players aren’t interested in PC vs. PC matchups, maybe the adventure needs to be tweaked. The episode numbers refer to the recom- mended order of play, if played as a whole campaign. But some may be moved out of or- der as needed. EPISODE 2: DANGER ZONE In a region outside normal trade routes, a dan- gerous being condemns the party to be exe- cuted for trespassing. ADVENTURE SUMMARY On a mission of exploration or of recovery, the adventurers enter a region that is largely skirted by the nations and powers they have to this point interacted with. But as soon as they enter an unmarked territory of the sea, a magi- cal warning and buoy halts their progress. When they inevitably pass it or destroy it, the guardian of the region comes to confront them. The creature who calls himself Guardian of the Shrouded Isles approaches in a massive ship, obviously more powerful than the PCs on a combat level, and declares that they will be destroyed, but they have time to pray. The only option is for the party to negotiate. If successful, the Guardian will launch a smaller vessel to tow the PCs to an outpost, where they will be charged and sentenced ac- cording to the laws of the country. Along the way, a pirate attack damages the Guardian’s ship, and provides an opportunity for the party to either help or escape. Should they escape, the nation of the Shrouded Isles becomes their enemy. Should they assist, they learn the true identity of the Guardian and the Shrouded Isles become an ally. RUNNING THE ADVENTURE To run this adventure, you need the D&D fifth edition core rulebooks (Player’s Handbook, Dun- geon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual). Most of the monsters that appear in this adven- ture are from the Monster Manual (MM), along with new creatures and NPCs, and monsters from Volo’s Guide to Monsters (VGM). When a creature’s name appears in bold type, that’s a visual cue pointing you to its stat block in Ap- pendix A or its source book, as may be indi- cated by the abbreviations above. Spells and equipment mentioned in the ad- venture are described in the Player’s Handbook. Magic items are described in the Dungeon Mas- ter’s Guide, unless the adventure’s text directs you to an item’s description in another book or in Appendix B. T Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text. 4 SEA TRAVELING ADVENTURE HOOKS There’s a region of the ocean of roughly 10,000 square miles that has not been greatly ex- plored. When occasionally a ship ventures in, they will either say that their progress was halted for strange reasons, or they are never heard from again. There has been little reason to venture in this open area, as no direct trade routes go through it, and no islands are known to exist within it with any valuable resources. But there are a few reasons a party might be made to venture in. AFTER EPISODE 1—WHERE NO ADVENTURER HAS GONE BEFORE If you’re playing the Sea Traveling adventures in episodic order, the party leaves the island of Altharp and begins traveling on to their next mission, or back to their home port. On the way, they either accidentally enter this un- charted region, or they are led to believe a shortcut might be possible through it. Alterna- tively, this could piggyback on one of the other adventure hooks presented here. LOST MERCHANTS A wealthy merchant has not heard from a ship they were expecting in some time. They’ve been on the lookout for reports of the ship, and some have come in saying that the ship was spotted somewhere near this uncharted region. The merchant commissions the adventurers to go and recover the lost ship. DARK OMENS Signs in the stars have indicated that some- thing dangerous has begun invading our plane in this region. A powerful enemy will only grow more powerful if it is not halted immedi- ately. It must be discovered and destroyed if possible. ACT I—HALTED The adventure comes on the party like a ran- dom encounter. Once they have passed the border—unmarked by any geographical fea- tures—read the following: The object is a magical buoy (see Appendix A). It has been tasked to hold them here until the Guardian of the Shrouded Isles comes to meet them (see Act II). But the Guardian won’t ap- proach for 24 hours. The circumstances of this location are diffi- cult to live in. The sun is hot and uncomforta- ble, with no clouds in the sky and no wind. At nightfall, a thick fog rolls in so that the stars are invisible and it is difficult to orient location PLACING THE ADVENTURE As mentioned, these voyages can find a home in any sea-based campaign. It’s recommended that the party have their own ship and a base of opera- tions. The town of Saltmarsh in the Greyhawk campaign setting is an excellent choice, but any location with a need for seafaring adventurers will do. In the Forgotten Realms, the Shrouded Isles could be replaced by the tabaxi realm of Maztica west of the Sword Coast. In any event, the sea upon which the party travels will need to be large enough that there are many uncharted is- lands and other locations. An object appears on the horizon, approaching fast, and at first you can’t make it out. Within seconds you see a ball, a little smaller than a hu- man being, colored in a rippling light of red, blue, and yellow. Below it dangles a long tail that matches its colors. When it nears your ship, it slows, and comes to rest directly in your path. DANGER ZONE 5 and direction. If no action is taken to change circumstances, crew morale will decline as the hours progress. The crew’s quality score (see Ghosts of Saltmarsh Appendix A) decreases by 1d4 every 6 hours of inaction. If you don’t use the rules for quality in your campaign, increase the crew tension and rest- lessness through roleplay. Every 6 hours the captain might make a Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check to keep the crew calm. In- crease the difficulty each time. (For example, the first check might have a DC of 10, the next of 12, then 14, etc.) If the check fails, the crew becomes hostile to the officers and might at- tempt to take control of the ship from them un- less they are made obedient through force, bribery, or negotiation. ACT II—YOU HAVE BEEN EXAMINED If the buoy is not destroyed, then the Guardian of the Shrouded Isles comes in his ship after 24 hours. If the buoy is destroyed, he will arrive more quickly, even venturing outside the de- fended region to pursue the PCs if necessary. At his approach, read the following: If the buoy has been destroyed, read the fol- lowing: If the buoy has not been destroyed, eliminate the clause, “and you have destroyed the warn- ing beacon.” The Vicegrip is in actuality an illusion, cast with the illusory flagship spell (see Appendix B). The real ship is a keelboat named the Silver Strand, manned by a tabaxi illusionist (see Ap- pendix A) named Fog in the Bay (Foggy). He has already cast illusory flagship, thus expend- ing his 4th-level spell slot, and mage armor, ex- pending a 1st-level spell slot and giving him an Armor Class of 15. The real ship is located about 30 feet back from the prow of the illu- sory ship, and he stands using the cantrip mi- nor illusion to send down the shouts in the false booming voice of the Guardian. It was his ex- cellent abilities as a sailor that allowed him to create waves that affected the PC’s ship. You may wish at this point to start a 10-mi- nute timer for your players, with an hourglass or other visual timer, to enhance the sense of doom and dread. The Guardian will give alerts every minute or so to keep the characters aware of their impending destruction. ACT III—NEGOTIATIONS As the timer counts down, the players will likely be forced to action. If they attack, the il- lusion will soon fade, and they will confront Fog in the Bay alone, who will do battle until killed, incapacitated, or victorious. In any com- bat scenario, if the buoy has not been de- stroyed, it will assist Fog in the Bay. If the timer runs out, the Guardian shouts down: A massive ship surges toward you with incredi- ble speed, and before you can maneuver away it looms above you, waves from its hulking size causing your ship to bob up and down. The port side turns to face you, with black wood dotted with iron spikes, and half a dozen ballistae and a catapult are all trained on your ship. You can read the name “VICEGRIP” painted near the ship’s prow. Easily 200 feet long and 100 feet wide, the deck of the ship is 50 feet above the water. You can see the small figures of human- oid crewmembers working along the four sails, each of which is as wide as a house. The mast- head is in the shape of a humanoid skull, and a huge green insectoid shape decorates the flag flying atop the main mast. A voice booms from above you: “Travelers, you have trespassed on the territory of the Shrouded Isles, and you have destroyed the warning bea- con. I am the Guardian of the Shrouded Isles, and you have been examined, and found guilty. Your destruction will commence in 10 minutes, during which time you may pray to whatever deities you worship.” 6 SEA TRAVELING Ballista attacks from the Silver Strand begin striking at the PCs, but they are made to ap- pear as though coming from the Vicegrip. If the PCs instead try to flee, Fog in the Bay will fire a ballista bolt from the keelboat each round until the PCs are out of range. It is not long after this that the incident of Act IV oc- curs. If they try to negotiate, the Guardian re- sponds with inflexible threats, unless the party can convince him of their peaceful intentions. This requires a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) check. They may also be able to convince him that they are too dangerous to fight him, due to some secret weapon or such. This requires a DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check. If negotiations are successful, the Guardian’s voice speaks: A rope is cast from the Silver Strand and tied to the prow of the PC’s ship. Fog in the Bay dis- misses the illusory flagship by detaching it from the Silver Strand. He is in the cabin of the Silver Strand until the Vicegrip disappears from view, at which point he casts disguise self and acti- vates his displacement ability, so that he appears to be a much larger figure in a black cloak. He then sets about conducting the PCs in their ship deeper into the territory of the Shrouded Isles at a speed of 3 miles per hour. Of course, at this point, the party may decide to initiate combat with Fog in the Bay, and he will fight back until the beginning of Act IV. ACT IV—NOT SO DIFFERENT At some point during the party’s interaction with the Guardian of the Shrouded Isles, a dangerous new enemy appears. It may come while the party is being towed by the Silver Strand, or while they are escaping, or even in the midst of combat. You as DM will need to use your discretion to decide at what point it appears. But at that moment, read the following: “Your time has elapsed. I hope you are prepared for your deaths. This is the judgment of the Guardian of the Shrouded Isles.” “Your execution has been delayed until you can be brought before the Shrouded Isles. There you will face justice, after being examined by more of their guardians. I will conduct you in this es- cort craft, the Silver Strand. Do not be deceived by its small size. The firepower of the Strand is equal to the Vicegrip, and you will be destroyed should you attempt to escape.” THE SHROUDED ISLES An old tabaxi settlement exists on a series of a dozen or more islands of various sizes. The larg- est of these is known as Belltower Island due to the dormant volcano looming over it, whose opening stretches down the side of the moun- tain’s face and is shaped like a large bell. These tabaxi have been isolated for genera- tions, as long as memory serves. Over that entire time, they have experienced regular raids from a group of githyanki who come to test their mettle against the islanders. This has only increased the seclusion and isolationist attitudes of the tabaxi. In reality, a mind flayer colony once possessed the Belltower Island and the tabaxi who inhab- ited it. The githyanki wiped out every trace of the mind flayers and liberated the tabaxi, but the tabaxi only remember the fighting, and the gith continue to appear in their airships for raids. No battle has ever been totally decisive, and the tab- axi have captured some of the gith technology, including a silver sword about once a genera- tion. But they have not yet discovered a way to take to the air or to fight the githyanki on their own “turf” in the Astral Plane. The culture of the Shrouded Isles values warri- ors and defensive magicians more than any other skill. Various illusion mages like Foggy are stationed in the sea around the islands to defend against outside attack, while evocation and abju- ration mages, along with warriors of all kinds, wait atop the islands’ mountains to do battle with their true enemies: the githyanki. The cloudless sky above suddenly splits with lightning. But unlike normal lightning, the bolt rests over the blue and then opens wide. Out of the gap glides down a small ship whose many sails shimmer like the wings of a dragonfly. DANGER ZONE 7 The ship is an astral skiff, manned by 2 githyanki warriors and 10 bandits (all of which are also githyanki, for the purposes of flavor). The warriors are twin brother and sis- ter trainees Balán and Belea, testing their met- tle in order to earn their silver greatswords. Their primary aim is to defeat Fog in the Bay and bring back proof to their clan in order to be awarded the promotion. The PCs are a side- issue, and the twins will relish the additional combat as enhancements to their strength and glory, but will not pursue them if they flee out- side the Shrouded Isles territory. The bandits are escorts and will remain be- hind manning the skiff unless it is necessary to save the twins. At least three creatures must be crewing the skiff at all times. The skiff will attempt to maintain a distance of 30 feet from the Silver Strand in order to opti- mize the twins’ use of misty step. They will have cast jump on themselves before the battle begins and will leap down onto the Strand in their first turn to begin attacking. When they enter, describe them: Balán is sadistic and cruel, and if ever seen at rest he will fiddle with his greatsword, shaving off the ends of his fingernails and toenails with it. Belea is more serious, and feels as though she has to show more effort to catch up with her larger, stronger brother. They are insuffera- bly competitive with one another, and each will push to steal a kill from the other. If one is brought below 20 hit points, they will ask the other whether they should retreat. If the other has more than 20 hit points, they will mock their twin for their cowardice and From among the dozen or so green-skinned crew of the flying ship two leap onto the boat below. Each is decked in a dull silver armor tied with leather, but their shoulders, feet, and hands are exposed, showing the thick dark freckles that cover their bodies. One is a male, 6 and a half feet tall, with reddish black hair waving thick over his right ear. The other is female, just under 6 feet, with long sandy hair, but a long scar creating a bald stretch over the left half of her scalp. Each one grins, showing sharp, tusk- like teeth, as they enter into battle with ferocity and glee. 8 SEA TRAVELING push to continue fighting. However at this point 1d6 bandits will drop from the skiff to as- sist. If both twins are brought below 20 hit points, or if one is incapacitated or killed, they will effect a retreat, using the Disengage action, misty step, and jump. During this encounter, the party will likely have a chance to see Fog in the Bay more clearly: he is a 5-foot tall grey tabby tabaxi with thick cheeks and whiskers and black fur cover- ing his paws. His eyes are bright yellow with flecks of red. His iron quarterstaff is decorated with different wavy patterns and starbursts and serves as a magical focus for his spells. RESOLUTION If Fog in the Bay perishes at any point, and if the PCs do not recover his log from the Silver Strand, the party will become sworn enemies of the Shrouded Isles, who may soon send assas- sins to wreak vengeance. This occurs even if the party attempts to help Foggy against the githyanki. If the party is successful in repelling the githyanki and assisting Foggy, he invites them to a drink in appreciation—the effect of which is that of a potion of superior healing. He then ex- presses that he might have been mistaken about the party and apologizes for the decep- tion of the Vicegrip and the Guardian, but his people have to be cautious due to the history of attacks from the gith. He then sets them free, stating that he will be speaking with the lead- ers of the Shrouded Isles to establish an alli- ance with them. He does caution that he should not bring the party to the Shrouded Isles now. They would be treated as outsiders, with great hostility, un- til he could make his case. They should stay away. But perhaps one representative could travel with him. This could be an NPC crew- member, or alternatively could serve as a way to “write out” one of the PCs. The subsequent alliance could manifest later in your campaign in a variety of ways. Fog in the Bay will make it very clear that he has to return. If the Silver Strand is destroyed, he will barter for a lifeboat if available, or to be dropped off at a port, where he will disguise himself and seek to purchase or steal a ship. Additionally, he charges the party to keep the Shrouded Isles a secret. This is his most im- portant goal. THE GITHYANKI Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes gives plenty of de- tails about the githyanki and githzerai, and all of that will fit quite well in this adventure. Balán and Belea are on a mission other than the slaughter of an illithid, however, and they come already with an airship. The explanation, should such a thing be desired, is simply this: This particular branch of the githyanki have had ongoing confrontations with the Shrouded Isles after destroying all the illithids, so that the com- bative tabaxi serve as sufficient testing grounds for their warriors and would-be knights. If more contact in the Astral Plane is interest- ing for your campaign, the astral skiff could be captured and used by the PCs, providing they discover how to use the helm, its piloting seat. The Sea Traveling adventures assume that more contact will occur with the gith, as they have somewhat more knowledge of the threat from the Far Realms than most on the Material Plane. At your option, the astral skiff might include a log that contains some information about the on- going strife between the gith and the Shrouded Isles, and perhaps hints at the location of the gith cities in the Astral Plane. DANGER ZONE 9 APPENDIX A: MONSTERS AND NPCS This appendix details creatures and nonplayer characters that are mentioned in this adventure and that don’t appear in the Monster Manual. That book’s introduction explains how to inter- pret a stat block. ILLUSIONIST Illusionists are specialist wizards who twist light, sound, shadow, and even minds to create false and quasi-real effects. They can be flamboyant and use their powers in spectacu- lar and obvious ways, or quiet and subtle, us- ing their magic to conceal the truth. The Guardian of the Shrouded Isles (Foggy), in this adventure, is a tabaxi illusionist who also has proficiency with navigator’s tools, vehicles (water), and Wisdom (Survival). (From Volo’s Guide to Monsters). MAGICAL BUOY A magical sentry created by the tabaxi of the Shrouded Isles to defend their territory. It looks like a ball of multicolored energy with a tail trailing behind. 10 SEA TRAVELING THE SILVER STRAND Gargantuan vehicle (60 ft. by 20 ft.)

The magic items introduced in this adventure are detailed here in alphabetical order. ILLUSORY FLAGSHIP 4th-level illusion Casting Time: 1 minute Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (a bit of driftwood and seaweed) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour You touch a ship. For the duration, that ship appears to be a far mightier ship. You can make it appear according to any design you like, but the space it occupies cannot exceed 200 feet in any dimension, with the real ship lo- cated anywhere within it. Up to 20 illusory crewmembers of any type can be seen to walk around the deck of the ship, and the inanimate parts of the ship can move naturally, in sync with the wind and waves or according to the actions of the illusory crew, and the waves look and sound as though they are splashing against the ship. Physical interaction with the illusion reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to ex- amine the illusion can determine that it is an il- lusion with a successful Intelligence (Investiga- tion) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature. As an action, rather than dismissing the spell, you can cause the illusory flagship to separate from the real ship, as though the real ship is a lifeboat or a smaller ship stashed somewhere on the flagship’s deck or lashed to the side. The flagship appears to sail away at a speed of 60 ft. until it is outside of visibility, at which point the spell ends.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
