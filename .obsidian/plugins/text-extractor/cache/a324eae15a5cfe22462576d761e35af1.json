This is an adventure of light-hearted dungeon exploration, featuring a fun pirate theme. The players will each be given a pirate characteristic to shake up their character before diving into the adventure. Once the adventure begins, the party will explore a strange ruin filled with odd characters, crazy challenges, and a few encounters to wet their blades. Whether this is a stand-alone game or part of a larger campaign, Quest on Kingspire Island will offer your group a good time, filled with adventure, silly antics, and a plot that can be easily tied into other campaigns. Character Creation No class or race is off limits, but players should keep in mind the pirate theme while rolling characters. They should be encouraged to select weapons that a pirate would use, or describe their weapons with a pirate flair. For example, a Scimitar might have the appearance of a curved pirate saber. Before the session is played, each player will need to roll on the Pirate Features table to get a random pirate characteristic to spice up their character. The table is below: Pirate Features Roll Table 1 Your character now has a fancy wooden peg leg with some cool carvings on it. What is the name of your peg leg? How did you get it? 2 Your character wears an eyepatch, even though they don’t need it. They probably move the patch around from eye to eye based on their mood that day. How fashionable. 3 Your character wears an eyepatch and needs it. Which eye did you lose and how did you lose it? 4 Your character is a mute, having lost their voice after some tragic event. You have a parrot that sits on your shoulder and speaks for you instead. How did you lose your voice and what is the parrot’s name? 5 You have a real pirates flare about you, and now you end just about every sentence with ARRRRH!! Or a similar pirate word. 6 You know that person on every pirate ship that starts panic by sharing crazy myths and tall tales? That is you. Whether there is a crazy story about that rock that looks like a fish or not, you are gonna tell one, and it’s gonna be a heck of a tall tale! 7 Those are some nice hands you have there! And by hands, I mean hooks! All your equipment is actually hook attachments, such as the blade of a sword or a cool spyglass. How did you lose your arms, and does it make it difficult to go to the bathroom? The audience wants to know. 8 For a while, you were the Bosin on a big pirate ship. That’s great, except that you have a habit of yelling out a repeat of the instructions given by anyone else in the crew, especially the captain. If they didn’t get the message the first time, they got it now! 9 What is sailing the high seas without a bottle in your hand? Or several? You probably didn’t think it was possible to have an alcoholic amongst pirates, but your character certainly set us straight! You have a bottle with you always, and you never stop drinking. 10 We SEA what you did there! What is life without a good pun. Your character makes their living off of telling great pirate puns, and the cornier, the better! Crew Roles To play the adventure, each player must take on a role in the crew. The roles are as follows, and are used to define certain story events and give bonuses to help with the adventure. • The Captain - +2 to Intimidation • The Navigator - +2 to Survival • The Muscle - +2 to Athletics • The Lookout - +2 to Perception • Pregame Before the start of the game, a few things should be done. • Read the Adventure Hook (see below) • Introduce the characters • Have the navigator tell the story of the journey to Kingspire Island Adventure Hook “In the legendary age of pirates, many stories were made that are shared in taverns to this very day. Tales of hidden treasures, sea battles, giant undersea creatures, damsels in distress, and of course, the tale of deeds of famous pirates. This is one such tale, following an unlikely group of pirates on their mythical quest to Kingspire Island!” The Game Kingspire Island Welcome to Kingspire Island, a place lost to history long ago. Recently, your hardy pirate crew won a treasure map in a game of cards at a well-traveled tavern in a pirate haven city. Seeing sparkles in your eyes, your crew embarks on the quest to find the fabled Crown of the Salt King, an ancient artifact rumored to be magical and made of pure gold. Such an item is worth a king’s ransom and would make its finders very wealthy indeed. Kingspire Island is a round, rising landscape with a tall stone temple at its center. The temple has a main central structure that extends out to 7 tall stone towers. Surrounding the temple is jungle, steep cliffs, and a thick fog. Describing the Journey • Ask the Captain about the name of the ship and to describe the vessel. • Ask the Navigator to tell the story of their journey to the island. • Ask the Lookout to tell the tale of first sighting the island. • Ask the Muscle to tell the story of the journey from the shore of the island to the tall stone structure at the island’s center. The Temple Entrance “Your group stands now in front of the great stone temple at the heart of the island. A large, dark opening looms before you, leading into a long, straight passageway. On the outside walls of the temple, strange text has been scribbled into the stone. Behind you stands the thick jungle from which you recently emerged. It is about noon”. • There are no traps, but an invisible spell is embedded into the door that will light rows of torches whenever someone enters (see below). • If a player observes the writing on the wall, they would see hundreds of different people’s script carved into the walls that reads “I am not worthy”. Entering the main door takes the party into a long stone corridor that is very narrow. Entering the hall triggers the torches throughout the temple to magically light themselves, illuminating the place. The corridor is several hundred feet long and leads to the Central Chamber. Central Chamber The Central Chamber is a large, circular chamber that is 40 feet in diameter. At the center of the room is a large horizontal stone wheel with a handle sticking out from one side. When the party first enters the room, the wheel is set in position 1. The wheel has four positions. When the handle is pushed and the wheel is turned, the central chamber rotated, connecting the two doors to different rooms. See the table below for a map of where each position connects. When the party enters the first time, the wheel is set to position 1. Behind them is the straight corridor through which they entered the temple. In front of them is the stone wheel at the room’s center, and behind the wheel is a large closed stone door with the carving of a crown on it. This door is sealed and can be opened with six keys which can be figured out by the six empty keyholes on the door. The door behind them is outlined with a green border and is called The Green Door. The doorway across from them us similarly outlined in red and is called The Red Door. These colored doorways remain in place as the room turns, helping to identify the different passages. Over each doorway will also be a symbol, giving a hint as to the challenge ahead. These are noted in the table below. Room Position Map Position Green Door Red Door 1 Leads to the entrance hallway and out of the temple Leads to The King’s Chamber. Symbol of a Crown on the door. 2 Symbol of a foaming mug over the door. Leads to Drinking Hall Symbol of a Fist. Leads to The Fighting Arena 3 Symbol of a question mark. Leads to the Hall of Riddles. Symbol of a Sword. Leads to the Dueling Hall 4 Symbol of a treasure chest. Leads to the Treasure Room. Symbol of a music note. Leads to the Hall of Music Once six keys are inserted into the crown door, it will open and allow the party to enter. Drinking Hall The drinking hall looks line the inside of a tavern, with wooden floors and tables, and a long bar at the far side of the room. Sitting at one of the tables is a dwarf named Galin Whiskey. Galin is the only person in the bar. Galin will challenge the party to a drinking game, offering a golden key as a reward for winning. All players who accept should join him at the table. When the game begins, each player will need to make a Constitution Saving Throw. Players who fail cannot handle the liquor and are out of the contest. They must pass three checks in order to win. The DCs are 5, 7, and 10. If they are victorious, Galin will pass out cold on the floor and a key will fall out of his pocket. Galin cannot leave the room, and his body would vanish if the party tried to take him from the room. Fighting Arena This is a large round room with a diameter of 60 feet. There are three sealed stone doors along the walls of the room, and a lever in the middle of the room. When the level is pulled, the door to the room will seal shut, and the three doors will open, revealing three groups of enemies for the party to face. For each door, roll on the encounter table below to decide what is waiting behind it. You may have the same choice more than once. When all enemies are defeated, a small stone pedestal will rise from the floor, holding a golden key and the door to the fighting arena will open again, allowing the party to leave. All monsters below can be found in the OGL content for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. Encounters 1 4 x Skeleton 2 3 x Orc 3 3 x Bug Bear 4 5 x Kobolds 5 8 x Swarms of Bats 6 10 x Zombies Hall of Riddles This is a large stone room with a table to the right of the door. On the table is a piece of chalk. On the walls across the back of the room are four riddles written on plaques. If the party successfully writes in the correct answer to a riddle, the riddle and the plaque will disappear. Once all have been answered, a golden key will appear hanging from the last plaque. Riddles Riddle Answer If a pirate ye be And ye get in a fight Ye might need ta’be wearin’ this If ye lose half yer sight Eyepatch There once was a famous pirate One who was truly feared A color and some facial hair This pirate was _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Blackbeard This pirate phrase is what ye get If ye take a two by four And place it up upon a shelf Inside of yer freezer door Shiver Me Timbers The image on this pirate’s flag Is sure to give them all a fright It has parts of a skeleton On a background as dark as the night Jolly Roger Dueling Hall This is a medium-sized round room, about 30 feet in diameter. Waiting in the room’s center is a human man glad in a gladiator’s armor who is wielding a long spear. This is Dan the Man, the master of the arena. The party will likely believe that they will have to fight him. If possible, let them keep this illusion until they accept the duel. Then, as the doors close, it will be explained that they will be facing the champion of the arena, an Ogre named Kreg the Crusher. Kreg has the same stats of a normal ogre, but he has 17 AC and 100 HP. Defeating the champion will result in the party being awarded a golden key from Dan. Dan will never help the party in any way during the battle, though he might cheer or egg on one side or the other. Treasure Room The treasure room is a huge chamber with piles of gold coins, and several closed treasure chests. Hanging from the hook on the back wall of the room is a golden key. A character will have to climb onto a pile of gold to reach it. Before the party enters the room, they would notice a halfling named Tallen Shortman who is waiting for them. Tallen will explain that the party may enter and take the key, but they may not take anything else. If the party enters and takes the key without taking anything else, they can do so safely. The DM should taunt them, however, with gold and treasures. If anyone in the room tries to take anything other than the key, a few things will happen. The first is that they will be denied the treasure they tried to take. If it is gold, it will melt in their hands, turning to molten gold, which will deal 1d6 fire damage. If they opened a chest, it will be empty. The second thing that happens is the door seals off the room with Tallen not in the room. Molten gold will begin to poor from vents that have opened in the walls, filling the room. The hook with the key on it will rise us, 15 feet above the pile of gold below it, requiring a DC 10 Athletics check to climb to and take. The stacks of gold in the room are 10 feet high. Above a stack of gold in the front right corner of the room is a small opening from which the players can escape, requiring a DC 10 Athletics check to climb out. The opening is 25 feet away from the floor. Have the party roll initiative. At the end of each round, the molten metal will rise 2 feet to a maximum of 20 feet. Any player in contact with the metal takes 1d4 fire damage, and anyone submerged will take 3d6 fire damage. Hall of Music The hall of music is a stage with rows of seats in front of it. There is no audience, but an elf named Tonedeath the Bard is standing by the stage. He would introduce himself and then request that each party member take a turn on stage and sing a pirate song. Each player may either choose to sing a pirate song or, if the DM chooses, allow them to make a DC 10 Performance check. Also, if the DM allows it, the players may look up songs online to sing. They may also sing a song together. The reward for completing the show is a golden key. King’s Chamber When six golden keys have been inserted into the door, it will dramatically open, revealing a room within. The room is a small square space with a closed wooden door on the far side that leads to The King’s Rest. There is a plaque in the room written in common. This is what is written on the plaque: “Song of The Salt King, Master of the League of Legendary Pirates - Yar Har, Fiddle, Dee Dee. Being a pirate is alright with me! Do what YOU want, because a pirate is free! YOU are a pirate”! King’s Rest This is a massive chamber, hundreds of feet across. Waiting in the middle of the room is a large red dragon, The Salt King himself! Just in front of him, on a pedestal, is a golden crown, The Salt King’s Crown. The party is not prepared in any way to battle a dragon. To get the crown, they may choose to persuade the dragon with words, or distract him while someone steals it. They may also sing the song of the Salt King, which will make the Salt King recognize them as worthy pirates deserving of the crown. Once the party has taken the crown, they will leave the temple, making their way back to their ship. At this point, the adventure comes to a close with stories of how the pirates went on to be the greatest pirates of all time by heading the wisdom of the Salt King’s song. The captain becomes the next Salt King, and legends of him and his crew and still sang to this day…","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
