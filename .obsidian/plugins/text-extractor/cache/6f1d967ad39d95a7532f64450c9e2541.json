As a result, there are a few options for play: Each adventure can be used in a standalone way. Any time the adventurers are at sea, one of these adventures can be inserted into the set- ting being used. Alternatively, these episodes can be strung together into a larger, ongoing campaign. They have been written with this idea in mind, and the ongoing threat from the Far Realms creates the basic through-line to the larger campaign. Well-meaning DMs should also prepare their players: Because many of these adventures have a personal thrust to them (the betrayal of good friends, the splitting of one’s own personality, etc.), Dungeon Masters and players should communicate about how much each is com- fortable with. If, for example a player doesn’t want to temporarily lose the agency of their character, or if your players aren’t interested in PC vs. PC matchups, maybe the adventure needs to be tweaked. The episode numbers refer to the recom- mended order of play, if played as a whole campaign. But some may be moved out of or- der as needed. EPISODE 5: DAMSEL WITH A DULCIMER The party meets a strange couple on an island, who at first seem to be rather unremarkable and mild. But soon the bodies start piling up. ADVENTURE SUMMARY A note on this story outline: the act structure of this adventure could be mishandled and made into a railroad. Do not do this. This adventure will work best as an encounter. It is made to be a more fleshed-out “random” encounter of sorts. The structure laid out here can be used by DMs as a general layout of what could hap- pen. What should be taken from it is the general characteristics of the NPCs and the setting. RUNNING THE ADVENTURE To run this adventure, you need the D&D fifth edition core rulebooks (Player’s Handbook, Dun- geon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual). It might also be helpful to have a copy of Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, as several details of the adventure come from that book. But a re- sourceful Dungeon Master can invent alterna- tives as needed. Most of the monsters that appear in this adven- ture are from the Monster Manual (MM), along with new creatures and NPCs. When a crea- ture’s name appears in bold type, that’s a vis- ual cue pointing you to its stat block in the Ap- pendix or its source book. ADVENTURE HOOKS The island of Claydell has little to attract ad- venturers to it. This adventure, therefore, could be only a simple encounter on the sailing of the adventuring party, an island they come upon in the middle of the night, after a long, arduous journey. Seeking land and respite, the chance to restock supplies, they might see opportunity here. Alternatively, or in addition, one of the following hooks might be employed (but please note: it would be very helpful for one or more [expendable] NPC crewmembers to ac- company the party on the island). T Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text. 4 SEA TRAVELING MISSION OF MERCY A humanitarian group (missionaries of Procan or St. Cuthbert, or else just well meaning peo- ple) discovered the island and its lonely resi- dents, and have collected food and other neces- sary supplies and hire the adventurers to de- liver them to the island. TREASURE ISLAND The adventurers find an old treasure map with this island marked in a curious symbol. There are no clues as to what the symbol means. Is it a treasure store? Is it a dangerous plague is- land? There’s only one way to find out. MYSTERIOUS COMMISSION Various opposing factions are aware or suspi- cious of the island of Claydell and the secret it harbors. The party receives a mysterious note—slipped under a doorway in an inn, or nailed to the capstan their ship—with coordi- nates for the island and a plea to “Protect.” PIRATE CHASE The royal treasury of a nearby sea elf city was recently robbed by pirates. Because of political tensions on the sea, mobilizing the army is a risky move, so the king commissions the party to pursue the pirates. The trail leads to Claydell. Note: Once the party arrives on the is- land, they might find several of the bodies of these pirates during Act I. ACT I—GO AWAY Claydell is a small, dry island, only 1 square mile in size. The only source of freshwater is precipitation, which comes in the form of massive storms a few times a year. Robert and Grace Hollow collect this water with a massive network of raincatchers. The vegetation is desert-like. Cacti and leaf- less thornbushes grow around the rocky land- scape. A few desert hackberry shrubs grow among them, producing their orange berries in the fall. These can be correctly identified with a DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check. The berries are highly nutritious. Visitors to the island will, after passing the initial crop of rocks that hide most of the inte- rior (but which are nevertheless easy to trav- erse), start to notice structures that support massive wooden tanks with gutters tipped to- wards them. Every hundred feet or so one of these tanks can be seen. A DC 12 Wisdom (Per- ception) check will also show snares surround- ing about a third of the tanks, with bells at- tached. There are, in fact, various birds, lizards, and rodents around the island which could be caught by such snares. A DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check can trace the paths and footprints to where the main habitation is on the island. About 300 yards in from the northwest is a thick rocky outcrop- ping—not quite a mountain, but not really a hill. Standing stones rise around it, with a hint that some of them might be ancient ruins of some larger building. A large cave is cut into the rock, which is the home of the Hollows. Whether the party meets him at his home or he comes to investigate the raincatchers, the in- itial meeting with Robert Hollow is hostile, though not incendiary at first. The following description may be given of him: PLACING THE ADVENTURE As mentioned, these voyages can find a home in any sea-based campaign. It’s recommended that the party have their own ship and a base of opera- tions. The town of Saltmarsh in the Greyhawk campaign setting is an excellent choice, but any lo- cation with a need for seafaring adventurers will do. The sea upon which the party travels will need to be large enough that there are many uncharted islands and other locations. You see an elderly man with thin grey hair and deep wrinkles, wearing a white cotton shirt that hangs like a tent over a withered frame. His skin is pale but with random ruddy splotches. The longsword in his hand is expertly wielded, so that despite his age, you can see he knows what he’s doing. DAMSEL WITH A DULCIMER 5 He will brandish his sword and warn the in- vaders to go away. At any offer of help or sup- plies, he will only say, “We don’t need any! Go away!” After a few moments, the party will no- tice another figure: This is Grace, a vampire spawn, but with some alterations from the monster found in the Mon- ster Manual. See the statblock in the Appendix. Grace and Robert willingly introduce each other as husband and wife, although they will keep her undead status a secret. If interaction with the party grows friendly, Robert will ad- mit that he was once a paladin in service of St. Cuthbert, and can even produce a cloth with the round symbol of that deity. His plate armor and shield are mounted on the wall of their home. This means that if physical confronta- tion occurs with him, his Armor Class is 9 un- less he can grab the shield, in which case it is 11. If he finds cause to don his armor, it will take him 10 minutes to do so. Note: Grace will be keenly aware of any char- acter with the ability to detect her undead na- ture, such as a paladin’s divine sense ability. She will therefore steer clear of such characters. However, she might try to lure them in by staying just at the edge of their senses’ radius without letting them see her directly, until she can get them alone and kill them. Grace will insist on inviting the travelers into their home, where she hopes to serve them THE HOLLOWS It is true that Robert was a paladin of St. Cuthbert. In one of his campaigns, he rescued the young Grace Pierce when her village was beset by a clan of orcs. The pair fell in love, and married soon after. Robert found a strug- gle in balancing his life as a holy avenger and that as husband. But once on a mission for St. Cuthbert, his wife became ill, and by the time he returned, she had died. He begged his god to restore her to life, but only received the answer that her resurrection would mean more suffering than joy. Robert grew angry with St. Cuthbert and forsook his vows. He then sought out alternative means to raise his beloved. He had learned in his adventures of an old woman in the waves who could do things beyond normal magics. Hiring a ship, he loaded his wife’s casket aboard and brought them both to a sandbar, where he met the sea hag Foamthroat Figgy Horseater. Despite being partially submerged, the hag’s hut was populated by spiders, and she had the strange habit of looking through massive gemstones to see those who came to her. Figgy agreed to help Robert, but required two things for such a high wish. First, he would sail with her to an island she designated. The second demand would be given then. Robert agreed to everything, so great was his grief. She led Robert’s ship to the island of Claydell, and she asked him whether he would do anything for his wife, anything to live with her. Would he, she asked, live anywhere with her? Would he accept any lot in life if he remained with her? He said yes. There she gave her second demand: he would stay on this island for the re- mainder of his life, and would prevent anyone else from examining the caverns and ruins. He agreed, and Figgy performed a disgusting and dark ritual, at the end of which, Grace Hollow came to her husband, looking as beautiful and young as she was when they first met. At first, Robert was overjoyed, but soon he learned the curse of his wife’s new life. She was a creature of night, a predator who devoured any visitors to the island. Her hunger was insatiable, and when she grew angry she would transform to look hideous. Because he has daily used his command undead ability to control her, she will not kill Robert, but she drinks from his veins regularly. Over the years he has grown weaker, but remains de- voted to his vow. He guards the island, and only wants to remain with his wife until his death. A pale young woman in a thick black cloak peers out from behind the trees. She smiles and says, “Robert, be hospitable! We can spare at least a glass of water with these weary travelers.” 6 SEA TRAVELING some scraps of dry, spicy bread and the bloody meat of some small animal. Robert will object, but does not want to arouse suspicion. The Hollows will not permit anyone to venture farther in than this entryway / kitchen area. To one side is a bedroom, with a coffin on the floor next to a small bed. To the other side is more food storage, but a trapdoor on the floor of that room leads down into a wider cave, with a subterranean stream encircling almost the whole chamber. On the other side of the stream is a massive crop of stones set in a cir- cle, with ancient and unreadable runes in- scribed in them. This is the area that Figgy forced Robert to swear that he would guard. See sidebar, “The Hollows,” and the Epilogue—The Island Secret. As soon as she is able, Grace will seek to iso- late whoever she views as the weakest among the visitors. If an NPC member of the crew has been able to accompany the party on this expe- dition, this will be her target. She will suggest that the ship should be given notice that the party is all right, or some other excuse to get the NPC out of the cave. She will then, after some time, make the excuse that she will want to go get water. If there is no NPC crew available, she will ex- cuse herself, claiming to be going to fetch more water. She will then flag down the ship in the guise of one of the party so that an NPC will come ashore. Either way, after she has left and the conver- sation with Robert has been able to progress, the party will hear a shriek from outside. When the go to investigate they find Grace standing in horror over the dead body of the NPC crew- man. Nearby are several orange hackberries, with a few in his mouth. She’ll say that she tried to warn him, but he ate them before she could stop him. Robert will corroborate the story, saying that these are particularly deadly berries that he and his wife have learned to avoid. Rather harshly, he will tell the party that they should have been more careful. If there is any dispute about the berries, Robert will double down and argue that while these berries look like the safe desert hackberries, they are in fact highly toxic. He does not want anyone to try the berries on his island, because he doesn’t want all that death surrounding him. Any investigation that ensues will be done without the help of the Hollows. Robert will make excuses for his wife, saying he needs to console her. He will at very least not allow her to be interviewed, although he might speak to the events himself. But he will emphasize that the party should simply leave. This place is too dangerous for them. The home of this pair is a shabby cave of pale tan rock. A humble table with two frail chairs rests against one wall. A stone stove is built into an outer wall, its chimney exiting high in the cave. Jars of meat, berries, and water line the floor. Cavernous hallways lead on to the left and right. Mounted on the wall near the left hall is a large suit of tarnished plate armor. A tattered white cape, stained and faded, hangs from be- hind. A shield rests against the wall on the floor near the armor. DAMSEL WITH A DULCIMER 7 ACT II—HE SHOULDN’T BE DEAD Examination of the body will provide several clues. After at least half an hour, a DC 12 Intel- ligence (Medicine or Nature) check will prove that the berries were perfectly safe. A DC 15 In- telligence (Investigation or Medicine) allows a character to realize that the blood has been drained from the dead man’s body, and there are tiny, almost unnoticeable pinpricks at his neck. By this point, the Hollows should have re- treated to their home, or deeper into the re- cesses of their home, where the party will not see them. If they go looking for them again, Robert will appear and resist their inquiries. Grace will have made herself scarce. If the party persists in looking for her, Robert will, quietly if possible, but loudly and violently if necessary, grabbing his shield with his first ac- tion, warn Grace away. While the party is occupied with Robert, in conversation or combat, Grace will disguise herself again in order to gain access to the ship. Robert will not know where she has gone, alt- hough he might soon suspect it. She will kill and stash a body, disguising herself as another NPC if necessary. She will claim at least one more victim onboard. Her hunting, however, will be slow. She will be very aware that she is under suspicion, and that quickly the party will realize she has the ability to shapeshift. Her hunger will conflict with her wisdom, however, so that she will strike when she finds it most convenient. ACT III—IT ISN’T A BAD LIFE After the bodies start piling up, if there is ever a moment that Robert is left alone by the party, he will don his armor and lie in wait for them. If he is not alone, eventually he will try fighting to remove the PCs and reunite with Grace. Assuming he has seen Grace within 24 hours, he will not have access to either his con- trol undead or dreadful aspect actions, having used control undead on his wife that day al- ready. His primary tactic will be to defend the home, using the ruins around him as cover. If Robert is lowered to 0 hit points, consider him defeated, not killed. If defeated, Robert will break down and admit everything (see sidebar “The Hollows”). He expresses grief over his actions, guilt over the abomination he permitted to be made of his wife, but says that it was so hard to be without her, and at least now, sometimes, he can almost feel comfort, that she is with him. He loves her, and she needs blood to live, in whatever semblance of life this is. While Robert will stop fighting if his hit points are ever lowered to 0, or if he is cap- tured, he will not willingly cooperate in the death of Grace. He will tell the truth as far as he can, but will not reveal her. He wants to bring her back to the island and to be left alone. He will not trust the PCs to accomplish this for him, but would try to get her to come back himself. ACT IV—WHAT COULD BE OFFERED? Whatever happens to Robert, Grace will learn of it: if he is killed, she will feel his control over her fade. If he is captured, she will hear about it from the crew. In the event that he has been captured, she will grow agitated. If he uses his divine sense ability, Robert can recognize Grace in whatever guise she is wearing, and she will know this. Her aim will then be to get as close to him as she can, perhaps disguising herself as REGARDING THE RULES OF VAMPIRES You may employ the rule that a vampire cannot enter a residence without being first invited. Each cabin of a ship would be considered such a habi- tation, but the ship itself, it could be argued, might be considered one as well. In such a case, Grace would not be able to enter the ship without being invited, or, disguised as an NPC, ordered aboard. A vampire’s resting place is also its burial place. For Grace, this is her coffin. This adventure assumes that a vampire will not die without rest, but cannot rest (and therefore regain hit points) apart from the coffin. 8 SEA TRAVELING the captain of the ship or a guard or medical officer, so that she can kill him. She’ll want to get him before he can recognize her and com- mand her, but the threat he poses in recogniz- ing her will be real. So if the party leaves Robert with only basic security, in the care of NPCs without any ex- plicit instructions that would prevent a dis- guised Grace from attacking him, he will be found dead when they return to him. If the party chooses to use him as bait, or to force him to find Grace, she will stalk as close as she dares, incapacitating the party before killing Robert. Once he is dead, she will hide again, biding her time before claiming another victim. But her hunger will always be a driving factor. Grace’s coffin is in the Hollow’s home, and while she does not need to use it, she cannot re- gain hit points apart from draining victims of their blood or resting in her coffin. If she takes any significant injury, she will be anxious to re- turn to her coffin. If she sees no easy way to do this, she will instead hunt more rapidly in or- der to restore her health. If the party tries to reason with her, Grace will not trust them. She will act like a wild ani- mal, weighing the risks of any action, taking the one safest and offering the most gain, from her perspective. It is possible for the party to get her to leave the ship in peace, but this will not work with direct action. If confronted, Grace will act like a cornered wolf. If she has been injured and a pathway off the ship is opened, and Grace believes no one is watching her, she will leave warily and quickly to return to her coffin. The party might conceivably leave the Hol- lows more or less as they found them. If Robert is left without Grace, he will spend some time mourning her, before taking an oath of venge- ance upon the party. If Grace is left without Robert, she will live on, subsisting on the blood of the small animals, growing ever more ani- malistic and vicious. If food ever grows scarce on the surface, she might eventually gain an interest in the mysterious cavern beneath her home. Although she cannot cross the flowing stream, enough drive could eventually cause her to become resourceful enough to reach the circle of stones…. EPILOGUE—THE ISLAND SECRET Foamthroat Figgy Horseater, the sea hag, sta- tioned the disgraced paladin Robert Hollow and his undead wife Grace here to guard the cavern beneath the island’s middle. Untold eons ago, the island was a volcano, later carved and molded by a civilization now lost to time. The only remaining artifact of their existence is the circle of stones in the subterranean cave. The cave is 50 feet high, and more than 200 feet in diameter. A stream cuts in at one of the cave’s edges from a spring below the ocean floor, and it flows in a circle around the center, before exiting out between a crag of rocks at the island’s base, out into the sea. The opening for the exit is only 10 feet wide, and difficult to see from outside the island. If noticed, how- ever, a creature could swim into the stream and enter the cavern that way. As for the stones themselves, there are 29 of them in a 50-foot diameter circle. Some stand upright, some lie horizontal, and some are stacked or leaned against one another. It ap- pears a mostly random arrangement, but no force or magic can move the stones, and there are runes etched dimly into the rocks, and a circle similar to a teleportation circle drawn around the inner circumference. None of this is capable of being read. Comprehend languages will fail. Detect magic recognizes the presence BEFORE YOU READ FURTHER! The information following is useful if you intend to use this adventure in connection with the rest of the Sea Traveling adventures. It will especially bear on episode 27: “Forever’s Edge.” You may, how- ever, place anything you like in the center of this cavern instead: treasure, artifacts, a portal to the Abyss, or anything else. But if you’d like to con- tinue the Sea Traveling campaign, read on. DAMSEL WITH A DULCIMER 9 of conjuration magic on the whole circle. Iden- tify reveals an unrecognizable magic as well as an intelligence that knows it is being touched. The only way to destroy the magic on these stones is the breath weapon of an emerald greatwyrm dragon (see Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons). The intelligence within the circle will not speak unless spoken to, and this requires a di- rect question asked of the stones, the circle, or the intelligence itself. When spoken to in this way, the intelligence introduces itself, in a booming voice that seems to come from the entire cavern itself, as “the Guardian.” It will honestly answer any ques- tion directed to it, but it does not remember its makers, and all it remembers about its purpose is that it has something to do with time. The Guardian is capable of changing the floor within the circle, showing images of the past. If it does this, the circle becomes a portal in time, allowing transportation back in time, to what- ever place is displayed. If no arrangement is made with the Guardian before passing through the portal, it is a one-way trip. But limits may be set. For example, “After we’ve spent 3 days in the past, bring us back,” or “Af- ter we obtain a certain object, bring us back.” Such agreements can be honored by the Guardian. However, he is not willing to allow anyone to step through. The Guardian enjoys company, and will show images, but if anyone makes a move to pass through, he will close the portal. Should anyone accidentally pass through, or slip through before the Guardian can close the portal, he will beg for someone to go back and repair the damage. For just such an adventure, see Sea Traveling episode 27: “Forever’s Edge.” Of course, Figgy will eventually learn of the party’s interference on this island, and she won’t want to take any chances. Many of those whose obedience she has purchased, or any new bargains she strikes, will be used to hunt the party down. She won’t mind if they’re dead, but alive they might bring in some inter- esting resources. And she at least wants to know how many other people know about what lies hidden in this island. 10 SEA TRAVELING APPENDIX: MONSTERS & NPCS DAMSEL WITH A DULCIMER 11 Grace Hollow is a vampire spawn of this sort, with the shapechanger ability instead of regen- eration. Her true form is a withered corpse, a long-dead Grace Hollow. She uses the ability to prey on her victims, disguising herself as someone trusted or well loved. Preferring sub- terfuge to direct confrontation, Grace will stay out of combat, hiding anywhere she can. Her immense hunger, however, will drive her to take more and more victims.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
