## **Geography**

Moray, one of the northernmost islands in the [[Moonshae Isles]], is known for its rugged terrain, dense forests, and wild, untamed coastline. The island’s weather is often harsh, with powerful storms and cold winds coming in from the North, making travel treacherous, especially along the western shores. The inland areas are dominated by towering cliffs, hidden coves, and thick forests that are home to a variety of dangerous creatures.

## **Demographics**

_Population_: Approximately 8,000  
Moray is populated primarily by the [[Ffolk]], the indigenous people of the Moonshaes, who have a strong connection to the land and its ancient traditions. The population is scattered across small villages and towns, with many residents living a subsistence lifestyle based on fishing, farming, and trade. In recent years, the [[Pirate Alliance]] has gained a foothold on Moray, using its secluded coves for smuggling and raiding operations.

## **Economics**

Moray’s economy is primarily based on fishing, whaling, and limited agriculture. The island's proximity to the [[Whale Graveyard]] provides it with a lucrative trade in whale products, though these activities often bring conflict with neighboring tribes and environmental factions such as the [[Order of Oceanic Scholars]] (OOS). Additionally, the growing influence of the [[Pirate Alliance]] has introduced black-market trade to the region, particularly in smuggled goods and contraband.

## **Politics**

The political landscape of Moray is complex, with no single faction holding complete control. The native [[Ffolk]] still maintain a traditional clan-based system of governance, but many of these clans have been weakened by infighting and raids from the [[Pirate Alliance]]. Additionally, the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Oceanshore Trading Company]] (OTC) maintain a watchful presence on the island, though their influence is limited by the remote nature of Moray and the growing lawlessness of the region.
