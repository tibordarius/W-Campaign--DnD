Based on your notes, it seems you are running a campaign focused on sea travel and exploration, with the players embarking on a voyage from Waterdeep to the Icewind Dales. The campaign appears to involve elements of leviathan lore, encounters with pirates and sea creatures, and the overarching mystery surrounding the disruption of the oceans. Here is a potential outline for the next session:

**Session 4: Arrival at the Icewind Dales**

**Overview:**
In this session, the players finally reach the frozen seas of the Icewind Dales after their perilous journey. They encounter the harsh conditions of the arctic region and potentially make contact with the Order of the Seaborn (OOS) research center located there. This session should introduce the players to the next phase of their quest, delving deeper into the mysteries surrounding the Elder Cetus and the Great Whale Council.

**Potential Scenes:**
1. **Navigating Icy Waters**: The players must carefully navigate their ship through treacherous icy waters and potentially encounter hazards like icebergs or sea monsters adapted to the frozen environment.

2. **Arrival at the OOS Research Center**: The players make landfall and are greeted by members of the Order of the Seaborn, who have been studying the strange oceanic phenomena in the region. They can learn more about the Elder Cetus and the Great Whale Council from the researchers.

3. **Exploring the Icewind Dales**: The players have the opportunity to explore the frozen landscape of the Icewind Dales, potentially encountering local wildlife, settlements, or ancient ruins tied to the leviathan lore.

4. **Clues and Foreshadowing**: As the players investigate the region, they uncover further clues and foreshadowing about the impending threat to the oceans, setting up future plot points and challenges.

5. **Preparing for the Next Leg**: With new information and resources from the OOS, the players must plan their next steps, whether it's continuing their journey by sea or venturing deeper into the Icewind Dales in search of answers.

This session can serve as a transition point, allowing the players to acclimate to the new environment while introducing them to key elements of the campaign's overarching narrative. It can also set the stage for future challenges and revelations as they continue their quest to unravel the mysteries of the leviathans and the disruption of the oceans.
