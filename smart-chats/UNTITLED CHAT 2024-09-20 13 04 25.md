Based on your notes, your vault appears to be a central element in your Nautical Campaign Knowledge Vault. It serves multiple purposes across different locations and storylines:

1. **Artifact Storage**: The vaults, such as those beneath the Aquatic Archives in Waterdeep and the Iron Vault in Thornhold, are used to store powerful oceanic artifacts and treasures, often under strict magical protection.

2. **Secret Research Facilities**: Locations like the Aethervault are hidden research facilities where secret studies are conducted, such as on the Aetherwhale migration patterns.

3. **Campaign Progression**: The vaults and secret rooms, like the one on Elowen's ship, play a crucial role in the campaign's progression by storing plot-relevant clues, ancient documents, and magical artifacts that are vital to the storyline.

4. **Challenges and Quests**: The vaults are often tied to quests and challenges, requiring players to locate them using clues, overcome environmental challenges, and face guardians or solve riddles to gain access.

These vaults are integral to the political intrigue, exploration, and adventure elements of your campaign, providing depth and complexity to the world you have created.
